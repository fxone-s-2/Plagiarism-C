Enter KING HENRY LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER the EARL of WESTMORELAND SIR WALTER BLUNT and others
So shaken as we are so wan with care
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
And breathe shortwinded accents of new broils
To be commenced in strands afar remote
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
Of hostile paces those opposed eyes
Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
All of one nature of one substance bred
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks
March all one way and be no more opposed
Against acquaintance kindred and allies
The edge of war like an illsheathed knife
No more shall cut his master Therefore friends
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ
Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
We are impressed and engaged to fight
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walkd those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were naild
For our advantage on the bitter cross
But this our purpose now is twelve month old
And bootless tis to tell you we will go
Therefore we meet not now Then let me hear
Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland
What yesternight our council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience
My liege this haste was hot in question
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken
A thousand of his people butchered
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
Such beastly shameless transformation
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land
This matchd with other did my gracious lord
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the north and thus it did import
On Holyrood day the gallant Hotspur there
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald
That evervaliant and approved Scot
At Holmedon met
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
As by discharge of their artillery
And shape of likelihood the news was told
For he that brought them in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse
Uncertain of the issue any way
Here is a dear a true industrious friend
Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse
Staind with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited
Ten thousand bold Scots two and twenty knights
Balkd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
On Holmedons plains Of prisoners Hotspur took
Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son
To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Athol
Of Murray Angus and Menteith
And is not this an honourable spoil
A gallant prize ha cousin is it not
In faith
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of
Yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son
A son who is the theme of honours tongue
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant
Who is sweet Fortunes minion and her pride
Whilst I by looking on the praise of him
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Of my young Harry O that it could be proved
That some nighttripping fairy had exchanged
In cradleclothes our children where they lay
And calld mine Percy his Plantagenet
Then would I have his Harry and he mine
But let him from my thoughts What think you coz
Of this young Percys pride the prisoners
Which he in this adventure hath surprised
To his own use he keeps and sends me word
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife
This is his uncles teaching this is Worcester
Malevolent to you in all aspects
Which makes him prune himself and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity
But I have sent for him to answer this
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem
Cousin on Wednesday next our council we
Will hold at Windsor so inform the lords
But come yourself with speed to us again
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered
I will my liege
Exeunt
Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
Now Hal what time of day is it lad
Thou art so fatwitted with drinking of old sack
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leapinghouses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flamecoloured taffeta I see no
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day
Indeed you come near me now Hal for we that take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not
by Phoebus hethat wandering knight so fair And
I prithee sweet wag when thou art king as God
save thy gracemajesty I should say for grace
thou wilt have none
What none
No by my troth not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter
Well how then come roundly roundly
Marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not
us that are squires of the nights body be called
thieves of the days beauty let us be Dianas
foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the
moon and let men say we be men of good government
being governed as the sea is by our noble and
chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal
Thou sayest well and it holds well too for the
fortune of us that are the moons men doth ebb and
flow like the sea being governed as the sea is
by the moon As for proof now a purse of gold
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning got with
swearing Lay by and spent with crying Bring in
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows
By the Lord thou sayest true lad And is not my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench
As the honey of Hybla my old lad of the castle And
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
How now how now mad wag what in thy quips and
thy quiddities what a plague have I to do with a
buff jerkin
Why what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern
Well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
time and oft
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part
No Ill give thee thy due thou hast paid all there
Yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch
and where it would not I have used my credit
Yea and so used it that were it not here apparent
that thou art heir apparentBut I prithee sweet
wag shall there be gallows standing in England when
thou art king and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law Do
not thou when thou art king hang a thief
No thou shalt
Shall I O rare By the Lord Ill be a brave judge
Thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt have
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman
Well Hal well and in some sort it jumps with my
humour as well as waiting in the court I can tell
you
For obtaining of suits
Yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman
hath no lean wardrobe Sblood I am as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear
Or an old lion or a lovers lute
Yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe
What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of
Moorditch
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
the most comparative rascalliest sweet young
prince But Hal I prithee trouble me no more
with vanity I would to God thou and I knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought An old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you sir but I marked him not and yet
he talked very wisely but I regarded him not and
yet he talked wisely and in the street too
Thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the
streets and no man regards it
O thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
to corrupt a saint Thou hast done much harm upon
me Hal God forgive thee for it Before I knew
thee Hal I knew nothing and now am I if a man
should speak truly little better than one of the
wicked I must give over this life and I will give
it over by the Lord and I do not I am a villain
Ill be damned for never a kings son in
Christendom
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow Jack
Zounds where thou wilt lad Ill make one an I
do not call me villain and baffle me
I see a good amendment of life in thee from praying
to pursetaking
Why Hal tis my vocation Hal tis no sin for a
man to labour in his vocation
Enter POINS
Poins Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
match O if men were to be saved by merit what
hole in hell were hot enough for him This is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand to
a true man
Good morrow Ned
Good morrow sweet Hal What says Monsieur Remorse
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar Jack how
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou
soldest him on GoodFriday last for a cup of Madeira
and a cold capons leg
Sir John stands to his word the devil shall have
his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of
proverbs he will give the devil his due
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil
But my lads my lads tomorrow morning by four
oclock early at Gadshill there are pilgrims going
to Canterbury with rich offerings and traders
riding to London with fat purses I have vizards
for you all you have horses for yourselves
Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester I have bespoke
supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap we may do it
as secure as sleep If you will go I will stuff
your purses full of crowns if you will not tarry
at home and be hanged
Hear ye Yedward if I tarry at home and go not
Ill hang you for going
You will chops
Hal wilt thou make one
Who I rob I a thief not I by my faith
Theres neither honesty manhood nor good
fellowship in thee nor thou camest not of the blood
royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings
Well then once in my days Ill be a madcap
Why thats well said
Well come what will Ill tarry at home
By the Lord Ill be a traitor then when thou art king
I care not
Sir John I prithee leave the prince and me alone
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
that he shall go
Well God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may
move and what he hears may be believed that the
true prince may for recreation sake prove a false
thief for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance Farewell you shall find me in Eastcheap
Farewell thou latter spring farewell Allhallown summer
Exit Falstaff
Now my good sweet honey lord ride with us
tomorrow I have a jest to execute that I cannot
manage alone Falstaff Bardolph Peto and Gadshill
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid
yourself and I will not be there and when they
have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut
this head off from my shoulders
How shall we part with them in setting forth
Why we will set forth before or after them and
appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at
our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure
upon the exploit themselves which they shall have
no sooner achieved but well set upon them
Yea but tis like that they will know us by our
horses by our habits and by every other
appointment to be ourselves
Tut our horses they shall not see Ill tie them
in the wood our vizards we will change after we
leave them and sirrah I have cases of buckram
for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments
Yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us
Well for two of them I know them to be as
truebred cowards as ever turned back and for the
third if he fight longer than he sees reason Ill
forswear arms The virtue of this jest will be the
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at
least he fought with what wards what blows what
extremities he endured and in the reproof of this
lies the jest
Well Ill go with thee provide us all things
necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap
there Ill sup Farewell
Farewell my lord
Exit Poins
I know you all and will awhile uphold
The unyoked humour of your idleness
Yet herein will I imitate the sun
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother up his beauty from the world
That when he please again to be himself
Being wanted he may be more wonderd at
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him
If all the year were playing holidays
To sport would be as tedious as to work
But when they seldom come they wishd for come
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
So when this loose behavior I throw off
And pay the debt I never promised
By how much better than my word I am
By so much shall I falsify mens hopes
And like bright metal on a sullen ground
My reformation glittering oer my fault
Than that which hath no foil to set it off
Ill so offend to make offence a skill
Redeeming time when men think least I will
Exit
Enter the KING NORTHUMBERLAND WORCESTER HOTSPUR SIR WALTER BLUNT with others
My blood hath been too cold and temperate
Unapt to stir at these indignities
And you have found me for accordingly
You tread upon my patience but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself
Mighty and to be feard than my condition
Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
And therefore lost that title of respect
Which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud
Our house my sovereign liege little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be used on it
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly
My lord
Worcester get thee gone for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye
O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow
You have good leave to leave us when we need
Your use and counsel we shall send for you
Exit Worcester
You were about to speak
To North
Yea my good lord
Those prisoners in your highness name demanded
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took
Were as he says not with such strength denied
As is deliverd to your majesty
Either envy therefore or misprison
Is guilty of this fault and not my son
My liege I did deny no prisoners
But I remember when the fight was done
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil
Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
Came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressd
Fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reapd
Showd like a stubbleland at harvesthome
He was perfumed like a milliner
And twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncetbox which ever and anon
He gave his nose and tookt away again
Who therewith angry when it next came there
Took it in snuff and still he smiled and talkd
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
He calld them untaught knaves unmannerly
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility
With many holiday and lady terms
He questiond me amongst the rest demanded
My prisoners in your majestys behalf
I then all smarting with my wounds being cold
To be so pesterd with a popinjay
Out of my grief and my impatience
Answerd neglectingly I know not what
He should or he should not for he made me mad
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
And talk so like a waitinggentlewoman
Of guns and drums and woundsGod save the mark
And telling me the sovereignst thing on earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise
And that it was great pity so it was
This villanous saltpetre should be diggd
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth
Which many a good tall fellow had destroyd
So cowardly and but for these vile guns
He would himself have been a soldier
This bald unjointed chat of his my lord
I answerd indirectly as I said
And I beseech you let not his report
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high majesty
The circumstance considerd good my lord
Whateer Lord Harry Percy then had said
To such a person and in such a place
At such a time with all the rest retold
May reasonably die and never rise
To do him wrong or any way impeach
What then he said so he unsay it now
Why yet he doth deny his prisoners
But with proviso and exception
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
His brotherinlaw the foolish Mortimer
Who on my soul hath wilfully betrayd
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against that great magician damnd Glendower
Whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March
Hath lately married Shall our coffers then
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home
Shall we but treason and indent with fears
When they have lost and forfeited themselves
No on the barren mountains let him starve
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer
Revolted Mortimer
He never did fall off my sovereign liege
But by the chance of war to prove that true
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
When on the gentle Severns sedgy bank
In single opposition hand to hand
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower
Three times they breathed and three times did
they drink
Upon agreement of swift Severns flood
Who then affrighted with their bloody looks
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds
Nor could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many and all willingly
Then let not him be slanderd with revolt
Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him
He never did encounter with Glendower
I tell thee
He durst as well have met the devil alone
As Owen Glendower for an enemy
Art thou not ashamed But sirrah henceforth
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease you My Lord Northumberland
We licence your departure with your son
Send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
Exeunt King Henry Blunt and train
An if the devil come and roar for them
I will not send them I will after straight
And tell him so for I will ease my heart
Albeit I make a hazard of my head
What drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
Here comes your uncle
Reenter WORCESTER
Speak of Mortimer
Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul
Want mercy if I do not join with him
Yea on his part Ill empty all these veins
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer
As high in the air as this unthankful king
As this ingrate and cankerd Bolingbroke
Brother the king hath made your nephew mad
Who struck this heat up after I was gone
He will forsooth have all my prisoners
And when I urged the ransom once again
Of my wifes brother then his cheek lookd pale
And on my face he turnd an eye of death
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer
I cannot blame him was not he proclaimd
By Richard that dead is the next of blood
He was I heard the proclamation
And then it was when the unhappy king
Whose wrongs in us God pardondid set forth
Upon his Irish expedition
From whence he intercepted did return
To be deposed and shortly murdered
And for whose death we in the worlds wide mouth
Live scandalized and foully spoken of
But soft I pray you did King Richard then
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Heir to the crown
He did myself did hear it
Nay then I cannot blame his cousin king
That wished him on the barren mountains starve
But shall it be that you that set the crown
Upon the head of this forgetful man
And for his sake wear the detested blot
Of murderous subornation shall it be
That you a world of curses undergo
Being the agents or base second means
The cords the ladder or the hangman rather
O pardon me that I descend so low
To show the line and the predicament
Wherein you range under this subtle king
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days
Or fill up chronicles in time to come
That men of your nobility and power
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
As both of youGod pardon ithave done
To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose
An plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
That you are foold discarded and shook off
By him for whom these shames ye underwent
No yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Your banishd honours and restore yourselves
Into the good thoughts of the world again
Revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt
Of this proud king who studies day and night
To answer all the debt he owes to you
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths
Therefore I say
Peace cousin say no more
And now I will unclasp a secret book
And to your quickconceiving discontents
Ill read you matter deep and dangerous
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to oerwalk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear
If he fall in good night or sink or swim
Send danger from the east unto the west
So honour cross it from the north to south
And let them grapple O the blood more stirs
To rouse a lion than to start a hare
Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience
By heaven methinks it were an easy leap
To pluck bright honour from the palefaced moon
Or dive into the bottom of the deep
Where fathomline could never touch the ground
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival all her dignities
But out upon this halffaced fellowship
He apprehends a world of figures here
But not the form of what he should attend
Good cousin give me audience for a while
I cry you mercy
Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners
Ill keep them all
By God he shall not have a Scot of them
No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not
Ill keep them by this hand
You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes
Those prisoners you shall keep
Nay I will thats flat
He said he would not ransom Mortimer
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer
But I will find him when he lies asleep
And in his ear Ill holla Mortimer
Nay
Ill have a starling shall be taught to speak
Nothing but Mortimer and give it him
To keep his anger still in motion
Hear you cousin a word
All studies here I solemnly defy
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke
And that same swordandbuckler Prince of Wales
But that I think his father loves him not
And would be glad he met with some mischance
I would have him poisond with a pot of ale
Farewell kinsman Ill talk to you
When you are better temperd to attend
Why what a waspstung and impatient fool
Art thou to break into this womans mood
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
Why look you I am whippd and scourged with rods
Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear
Of this vile politician Bolingbroke
In Richards timewhat do you call the place
A plague upon it it is in Gloucestershire
Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
His uncle York where I first bowd my knee
Unto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke
Sblood
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh
At Berkley castle
You say true
Why what a candy deal of courtesy
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me
Lookwhen his infant fortune came to age
And gentle Harry Percy and kind cousin
O the devil take such cozeners God forgive me
Good uncle tell your tale I have done
Nay if you have not to it again
We will stay your leisure
I have done i faith
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners
Deliver them up without their ransom straight
And make the Douglas son your only mean
For powers in Scotland which for divers reasons
Which I shall send you written be assured
Will easily be granted You my lord
To Northumberland
Your son in Scotland being thus employd
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Of that same noble prelate well beloved
The archbishop
Of York is it not
True who bears hard
His brothers death at Bristol the Lord Scroop
I speak not this in estimation
As what I think might be but what I know
Is ruminated plotted and set down
And only stays but to behold the face
Of that occasion that shall bring it on
I smell it upon my life it will do well
Before the game is afoot thou still letst slip
Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
And then the power of Scotland and of York
To join with Mortimer ha
And so they shall
In faith it is exceedingly well aimd
And tis no little reason bids us speed
To save our heads by raising of a head
For bear ourselves as even as we can
The king will always think him in our debt
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied
Till he hath found a time to pay us home
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love
He does he does well be revenged on him
Cousin farewell no further go in this
Than I by letters shall direct your course
When time is ripe which will be suddenly
Ill steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once
As I will fashion it shall happily meet
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
Which now we hold at much uncertainty
Farewell good brother we shall thrive I trust
Uncle Adieu O let the hours be short
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport
Exeunt

Enter Chamberlain
Good morrow Master Gadshill It holds current that
I told you yesternight theres a franklin in the
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
him in gold I heard him tell it to one of his
company last night at supper a kind of auditor one

Sirrah if they meet not with Saint Nicholas
clerks Ill give thee this neck
No Ill none of it I pray thee keep that for the

Sir John hangs with me and thou knowest he is no
starveling Tut there are other Trojans that thou
dreamest not of the which for sport sake are
content to do the profession some grace that would
if matters should be looked into for their own
credit sake make all whole I am joined with no
footland rakers no longstaff sixpenny strikers
none of these mad mustachio purplehued maltworms
but with nobility and tranquillity burgomasters and
great oneyers such as can hold in such as will
strike sooner than speak and speak sooner than
drink and drink sooner than pray and yet zounds
I lie for they pray continually to their saint the
commonwealth or rather not pray to her but prey
on her for they ride up and down on her and make
her their boots
What the commonwealth their boots will she hold
out water in foul way
She will she will justice hath liquored her We
steal as in a castle cocksure we have the receipt
of fernseed we walk invisible
Nay by my faith I think you are more beholding to
the night than to fernseed for your walking invisible
Give me thy hand thou shalt have a share in our
purchase as I am a true man
Nay rather let me have it as you are a false thief
Go to homo is a common name to all men Bid the
ostler bring my gelding out of the stable Farewell

Enter LADY PERCY
How now Kate I must leave you within these two hours
O my good lord why are you thus alone
For what offence have I this fortnight been
A banishd woman from my Harrys bed
Tell me sweet lord what ist that takes from thee
Thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth
And start so often when thou sitst alone
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thickeyed musing and cursed melancholy
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watchd
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed
Cry Courage to the field And thou hast talkd
Of sallies and retires of trenches tents
Of palisadoes frontiers parapets
Of basilisks of cannon culverin
Of prisoners ransom and of soldiers slain
And all the currents of a heady fight
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
And thus hath so bestirrd thee in thy sleep
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Like bubbles in a latedisturbed stream
And in thy face strange motions have appeard
Such as we see when men restrain their breath
On some great sudden hest O what portents are these
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand
And I must know it else he loves me not
What ho

In faith Ill break thy little finger Harry
An if thou wilt not tell me all things true

We must have bloody noses and crackd crowns
And pass them current too Gods me my horse

have with me
Do you not love me do you not indeed
Well do not then for since you love me not
I will not love myself Do you not love me
Nay tell me if you speak in jest or no
Come wilt thou see me ride
And when I am on horseback I will swear
I love thee infinitely But hark you Kate
I must not have you henceforth question me
Whither I go nor reason whereabout
Whither I must I must and to conclude
This evening must I leave you gentle Kate
I know you wise but yet no farther wise

But yet a woman and for secrecy
No lady closer for I well believe
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know
And so far will I trust thee gentle Kate
How so far

Today will I set forth tomorrow you
Will this content you Kate

Speak sirs how was it
We four set upon some dozen
Sixteen at least my lord
And bound them
No no they were not bound
You rogue they were bound every man of them or I

As we were sharing some six or seven fresh men set upon us
And unbound the rest and then come in the other

All I know not what you call all but if I fought
not with fifty of them I am a bunch of radish if
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old

point Four rogues in buckram let drive at me

points in my target thus
Seven why there were but four even now
In buckram
Ay four in buckram suits
Seven by these hilts or I am a villain else
Prithee let him alone we shall have more anon
Dost thou hear me Hal
Ay and mark thee too Jack
Do so for it is worth the listening to These nine
in buckram that I told thee of
So two more already
Their points being broken
Down fell their hose
Began to give me ground but I followed me close
came in foot and hand and with a thought seven of
the eleven I paid
O monstrous eleven buckram men grown out of two
But as the devil would have it three misbegotten
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me for it was so dark Hal that thou couldst
not see thy hand
These lies are like their father that begets them
gross as a mountain open palpable Why thou

Well breathe awhile and then to it again and
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons
hear me speak but this
Mark Jack
We two saw you four set on four and bound them and
were masters of their wealth Mark now how a plain
tale shall put you down Then did we two set on you
four and with a word outfaced you from your
prize and have it yea and can show it you here in
the house and Falstaff you carried your guts
away as nimbly with as quick dexterity and roared
for mercy and still run and roared as ever I heard
bullcalf What a slave art thou to hack thy sword
as thou hast done and then say it was in fight
What trick what device what startinghole canst
thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
apparent shame
Come lets hear Jack what trick hast thou now
By the Lord I knew ye as well as he that made ye
Why hear you my masters was it for me to kill the
heirapparent should I turn upon the true prince
why thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules but
beware instinct the lion will not touch the true
prince Instinct is a great matter I was now a
coward on instinct I shall think the better of
myself and thee during my life I for a valiant
lion and thou for a true prince But by the Lord
lads I am glad you have the money Hostess clap
to the doors watch tonight pray tomorrow
Gallants lads boys hearts of gold all the titles
of good fellowship come to you What shall we be

I give him his answer
Prithee do Jack
Faith and Ill send him packing
Exit FALSTAFF
Now sirs byr lady you fought fair so did you
Peto so did you Bardolph you are lions too you
ran away upon instinct you will not touch the true
prince no fie
Faith I ran when I saw others run
Faith tell me now in earnest how came Falstaffs
sword so hacked
Why he hacked it with his dagger and said he would
swear truth out of England but he would make you
believe it was done in fight and persuaded us to do the like
Yea and to tickle our noses with speargrass to
make them bleed and then to beslubber our garments
with it and swear it was the blood of true men I
did that I did not this seven year before I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices
O villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
ago and wert taken with the manner and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore Thou hadst fire and
sword on thy side and yet thou rannest away what
instinct hadst thou for it
My lord do you see these meteors do you behold
these exhalations
I do
What think you they portend
Hot livers and cold purses
Choler my lord if rightly taken
No if rightly taken halter
Reenter FALSTAFF
Here comes lean Jack here comes barebone
How now my sweet creature of bombast
How long ist ago Jack since thou sawest thine own knee
My own knee when I was about thy years Hal I was
not an eagles talon in the waist I could have
crept into any aldermans thumbring a plague of
sighing and grief it blows a man up like a
bladder Theres villanous news abroad here was
Sir John Bracy from your father you must to the
court in the morning That same mad fellow of the
north Percy and he of Wales that gave Amamon the
bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
hookwhat a plague call you him
O Glendower
Owen Owen the same and his soninlaw Mortimer
and old Northumberland and that sprightly Scot of
Scots Douglas that runs o horseback up a hill
perpendicular
He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
kills a sparrow flying
You have hit it
So did he never the sparrow
Well that rascal hath good mettle in him he will not run
Why what a rascal art thou then to praise him so
for running
O horseback ye cuckoo but afoot he will not budge a foot
Yes Jack upon instinct
I grant ye upon instinct Well he is there too
and one Mordake and a thousand bluecaps more
Worcester is stolen away tonight thy fathers
beard is turned white with the news you may buy
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel
Why then it is like if there come a hot June and
this civil buffeting hold we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hobnails by the hundreds
By the mass lad thou sayest true it is like we
shall have good trading that way But tell me Hal
art not thou horrible afeard thou being
heirapparent could the world pick thee out three
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas that
spirit Percy and that devil Glendower Art thou
not horribly afraid doth not thy blood thrill at
it
Not a whit i faith I lack some of thy instinct
Well thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the
particulars of my life
Shall I content this chair shall be my state
this dagger my sceptre and this cushion my crown
Thy state is taken for a joinedstool thy golden
sceptre for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich
crown for a pitiful bald crown
Well an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee
now shalt thou be moved Give me a cup of sack to
make my eyes look red that it may be thought I have
wept for I must speak in passion and I will do it
in King Cambyses vein
Well here is my leg
And here is my speech Stand aside nobility
O Jesu this is excellent sport i faith
Weep not sweet queen for trickling tears are vain
O the father how he holds his countenance
For Gods sake lords convey my tristful queen
For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes
O Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry
players as ever I see
Peace good pintpot peace good ticklebrain
Harry I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
time but also how thou art accompanied for though
the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster
it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears That thou art my son I have
partly thy mothers word partly my own opinion
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
foolishhanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant
me If then thou be son to me here lies the point
why being son to me art thou so pointed at Shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
blackberries a question not to be asked Shall
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses a
question to be asked There is a thing Harry
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch
as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth
the company thou keepest for Harry now I do not
speak to thee in drink but in tears not in
pleasure but in passion not in words only but in
woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
have often noted in thy company but I know not his name
What manner of man an it like your majesty
A goodly portly man i faith and a corpulent of a
cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble
carriage and as I think his age some fifty or
byr lady inclining to three score and now I
remember me his name is Falstaff if that man
should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for Harry
I see virtue in his looks If then the tree may be
known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then
peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that
Falstaff him keep with the rest banish And tell
me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast
thou been this month
Dost thou speak like a king Do thou stand for me
and Ill play my father
Depose me if thou dost it half so gravely so
majestically both in word and matter hang me up by
the heels for a rabbitsucker or a poulters hare
Well here I am set
And here I stand judge my masters
Now Harry whence come you
My noble lord from Eastcheap
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous
Sblood my lord they are false nay Ill tickle
ye for a young prince i faith
Swearest thou ungracious boy henceforth neer look
on me Thou art violently carried away from grace
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
old fat man a tun of man is thy companion Why
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that
boltinghutch of beastliness that swollen parcel
of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed
cloakbag of guts that roasted Manningtree ox with
the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that
grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in
years Wherein is he good but to taste sack and
drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a
capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft
wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous
but in all things wherein worthy but in nothing
I would your grace would take me with you whom
means your grace
That villanous abominable misleader of youth
Falstaff that old whitebearded Satan
My lord the man I know
I know thou dost
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself
were to say more than I know That he is old the
more the pity his white hairs do witness it but
that he is saving your reverence a whoremaster
that I utterly deny If sack and sugar be a fault
God help the wicked if to be old and merry be a
sin then many an old host that I know is damned if
to be fat be to be hated then Pharaohs lean kine
are to be loved No my good lord banish Peto
banish Bardolph banish Poins but for sweet Jack
Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff
valiant Jack Falstaff and therefore more valiant
being as he is old Jack Falstaff banish not him
thy Harrys company banish not him thy Harrys
company banish plump Jack and banish all the world

Good morrow good my lord
Enter HOTSPUR WORCESTER MORTIMER and GLENDOWER
These promises are fair the parties sure
And our induction full of prosperous hope
Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower
Will you sit down
And uncle Worcester a plague upon it
I have forgot the map
No here it is
Sit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspur
For by that name as oft as Lancaster
Doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
And you in hell as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of
I cannot blame him at my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
Of burning cressets and at my birth
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Shaked like a coward
Why so it would have done at the same season if
your mothers cat had but kittened though yourself
had never been born
I say the earth did shake when I was born
And I say the earth was not of my mind
If you suppose as fearing you it shook
The heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
And not in fear of your nativity
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
In strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
Is with a kind of colic pinchd and vexd
By the imprisoning of unruly wind
Within her womb which for enlargement striving
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
Steeples and mossgrown towers At your birth
Our grandam earth having this distemperature
In passion shook
Cousin of many men
I do not bear these crossings Give me leave
To tell you once again that at my birth
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
The goats ran from the mountains and the herds
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
These signs have markd me extraordinary
And all the courses of my life do show
I am not in the roll of common men
Where is he living clippd in with the sea
That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales
Which calls me pupil or hath read to me
And bring him out that is but womans son
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
And hold me pace in deep experiments
I think theres no man speaks better Welsh
Ill to dinner
Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad
I can call spirits from the vasty deep
Why so can I or so can any man
But will they come when you do call for them
Why I can teach you cousin to command
The devil
And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil
By telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
If thou have power to raise him bring him hither
And Ill be sworn I have power to shame him hence
O while you live tell truth and shame the devil
Come come no more of this unprofitable chat
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye
And sandybottomd Severn have I sent him
Bootless home and weatherbeaten back
Home without boots and in foul weather too
How scapes he agues in the devils name
Come heres the map shall we divide our right
According to our threefold order taen
The archdeacon hath divided it
Into three limits very equally
England from Trent and Severn hitherto
By south and east is to my part assignd
All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore
And all the fertile land within that bound
To Owen Glendower and dear coz to you
The remnant northward lying off from Trent
And our indentures tripartite are drawn
Which being sealed interchangeably
A business that this night may execute
Tomorrow cousin Percy you and I
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
To meet your father and the Scottish power
As is appointed us at Shrewsbury
My father Glendower is not ready yet
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days
Within that space you may have drawn together
Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
A shorter time shall send me to you lords
And in my conduct shall your ladies come
From whom you now must steal and take no leave
For there will be a world of water shed
Upon the parting of your wives and you
Methinks my moiety north from Burton here
In quantity equals not one of yours
See how this river comes me cranking in
And cuts me from the best of all my land
A huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out
Ill have the current in this place dammd up
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
In a new channel fair and evenly
It shall not wind with such a deep indent
To rob me of so rich a bottom here
Not wind it shall it must you see it doth
Yea but
Mark how he bears his course and runs me up
With like advantage on the other side
Gelding the opposed continent as much
As on the other side it takes from you
Yea but a little charge will trench him here
And on this north side win this cape of land
And then he runs straight and even
Ill have it so a little charge will do it
Ill not have it alterd
Will not you
No nor you shall not
Who shall say me nay
Why that will I
Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh
I can speak English lord as well as you
For I was traind up in the English court
Where being but young I framed to the harp
Many an English ditty lovely well
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament
A virtue that was never seen in you
Marry
And I am glad of it with all my heart
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
Than one of these same metre balladmongers
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turnd
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge
Nothing so much as mincing poetry
Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag
Come you shall have Trent turnd
I do not care Ill give thrice so much land
To any welldeserving friend
But in the way of bargain mark ye me
Ill cavil on the ninth part of a hair
Are the indentures drawn shall we be gone
The moon shines fair you may away by night
Ill haste the writer and withal
Break with your wives of your departure hence
I am afraid my daughter will run mad
So much she doteth on her Mortimer
Exit GLENDOWER
Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father
I cannot choose sometime he angers me
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies
And of a dragon and a finless fish
A clipwingd griffin and a moulten raven
A couching lion and a ramping cat
And such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff
As puts me from my faith I tell you what
He held me last night at least nine hours
In reckoning up the several devils names
That were his lackeys I cried hum and well go to
But markd him not a word O he is as tedious
As a tired horse a railing wife
Worse than a smoky house I had rather live
With cheese and garlic in a windmill far
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
In any summerhouse in Christendom
In faith he is a worthy gentleman
Exceedingly well read and profited
In strange concealments valiant as a lion
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
As mines of India Shall I tell you cousin
He holds your temper in a high respect
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
When you come cross his humour faith he does
I warrant you that man is not alive
Might so have tempted him as you have done
Without the taste of danger and reproof
But do not use it oft let me entreat you
In faith my lord you are too wilfulblame
And since your coming hither have done enough
To put him quite beside his patience
You must needs learn lord to amend this fault
Though sometimes it show greatness courage blood
And thats the dearest grace it renders you
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
Defect of manners want of government
Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
The least of which haunting a nobleman
Loseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stain
Upon the beauty of all parts besides
Beguiling them of commendation
Well I am schoold good manners be your speed
Here come our wives and let us take our leave
Reenter GLENDOWER with the ladies
This is the deadly spite that angers me
My wife can speak no English I no Welsh
My daughter weeps she will not part with you
Shell be a soldier too shell to the wars
Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Shall follow in your conduct speedily
Glendower speaks to her in Welsh and she answers him in the same
She is desperate here a peevish selfwind harlotry
one that no persuasion can do good upon
The lady speaks in Welsh
I understand thy looks that pretty Welsh
Which thou pourst down from these swelling heavens
I am too perfect in and but for shame
In such a parley should I answer thee
The lady speaks again in Welsh
I understand thy kisses and thou mine
And thats a feeling disputation
But I will never be a truant love
Till I have learned thy language for thy tongue
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennd
Sung by a fair queen in a summers bower
With ravishing division to her lute
Nay if you melt then will she run mad
The lady speaks again in Welsh
O I am ignorance itself in this
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
And rest your gentle head upon her lap
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
Making such difference twixt wake and sleep
As is the difference betwixt day and night
The hour before the heavenlyharnessd team
Begins his golden progress in the east
With all my heart Ill sit and hear her sing
By that time will our book I think be drawn
Do so
And those musicians that shall play to you
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
And straight they shall be here sit and attend
Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down come
quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lap
Go ye giddy goose
The music plays
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh
And tis no marvel he is so humorous
Byr lady he is a good musician
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
altogether governed by humours Lie still ye thief
and hear the lady sing in Welsh
I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in Irish
Wouldst thou have thy head broken
No
Then be still
Neithertis a womans fault
Now God help thee
To the Welsh ladys bed
Whats that
Peace she sings
Here the lady sings a Welsh song
Come Kate Ill have your song too
Not mine in good sooth
Not yours in good sooth Heart you swear like a
comfitmakers wife Not you in good sooth and
as true as I live and as God shall mend me and
as sure as day
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
As if thou never walkst further than Finsbury
Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art
A good mouthfilling oath and leave in sooth
And such protest of peppergingerbread
To velvetguards and Sundaycitizens
Come sing
I will not sing
Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast
teacher An the indentures be drawn Ill away
within these two hours and so come in when ye will
Exit
Come come Lord Mortimer you are as slow
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go
By this our book is drawn well but seal
And then to horse immediately
With all my heart
Exeunt
Enter KING HENRY IV PRINCE HENRY and others
Lords give us leave the Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference but be near at hand
For we shall presently have need of you
Exeunt Lords
I know not whether God will have it so
For some displeasing service I have done
That in his secret doom out of my blood
Hell breed revengement and a scourge for me
But thou dost in thy passages of life
Make me believe that thou art only markd
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
To punish my mistreadings Tell me else
Could such inordinate and low desires
Such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
Such barren pleasures rude society
As thou art matchd withal and grafted to
Accompany the greatness of thy blood
And hold their level with thy princely heart
So please your majesty I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal
Yet such extenuation let me beg
As in reproof of many tales devised
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
I may for some things true wherein my youth
Hath faulty wanderd and irregular
Find pardon on my true submission
God pardon thee yet let me wonder Harry
At thy affections which do hold a wing
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
Which by thy younger brother is supplied
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the court and princes of my blood
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruind and the soul of every man
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall
Had I so lavish of my presence been
So commonhackneyd in the eyes of men
So stale and cheap to vulgar company
Opinion that did help me to the crown
Had still kept loyal to possession
And left me in reputeless banishment
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood
By being seldom seen I could not stir
But like a comet I was wonderd at
That men would tell their children This is he
Others would say Where which is Bolingbroke
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven
And dressd myself in such humility
That I did pluck allegiance from mens hearts
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
Even in the presence of the crowned king
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new
My presence like a robe pontifical
Neer seen but wonderd at and so my state
Seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
And won by rareness such solemnity
The skipping king he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
Mingled his royalty with capering fools
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
And gave his countenance against his name
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative
Grew a companion to the common streets
Enfeoffd himself to popularity
That being daily swallowd by mens eyes
They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much
So when he had occasion to be seen
He was but as the cuckoo is in June
Heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
As sick and blunted with community
Afford no extraordinary gaze
Such as is bent on sunlike majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down
Slept in his face and renderd such aspect
As cloudy men use to their adversaries
Being with his presence glutted gorged and full
And in that very line Harry standest thou
For thou has lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation not an eye
But is aweary of thy common sight
Save mine which hath desired to see thee more
Which now doth that I would not have it do
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness
I shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
Be more myself
For all the world
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh
And even as I was then is Percy now
Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou the shadow of succession
For of no right nor colour like to right
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm
Turns head against the lions armed jaws
And being no more in debt to years than thou
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms
What neverdying honour hath he got
Against renowned Douglas whose high deeds
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ
Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothes
This infant warrior in his enterprises
Discomfited great Douglas taen him once
Enlarged him and made a friend of him
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
And shake the peace and safety of our throne
And what say you to this Percy Northumberland
The Archbishops grace of York Douglas Mortimer
Capitulate against us and are up
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee
Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes
Which art my nearst and dearest enemy
Thou that art like enough through vassal fear
Base inclination and the start of spleen
To fight against me under Percys pay
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
To show how much thou art degenerate
Do not think so you shall not find it so
And God forgive them that so much have swayd
Your majestys good thoughts away from me
I will redeem all this on Percys head
And in the closing of some glorious day
Be bold to tell you that I am your son
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favours in a bloody mask
Which washd away shall scour my shame with it
And that shall be the day wheneer it lights
That this same child of honour and renown
This gallant Hotspur this allpraised knight
And your unthoughtof Harry chance to meet
For every honour sitting on his helm
Would they were multitudes and on my head
My shames redoubled for the time will come
That I shall make this northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
And I will call him to so strict account
That he shall render every glory up
Yea even the slightest worship of his time
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart
This in the name of God I promise here
The which if He be pleased I shall perform
I do beseech your majesty may salve
The longgrown wounds of my intemperance
If not the end of life cancels all bands
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
A hundred thousand rebels die in this
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
Enter BLUNT
How now good Blunt thy looks are full of speed
So hath the business that I come to speak of
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
That Douglas and the English rebels met
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
A mighty and a fearful head they are
If promises be kept on every hand
As ever offerd foul play in the state
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today
With him my son Lord John of Lancaster
For this advertisement is five days old
On Wednesday next Harry you shall set forward
On Thursday we ourselves will march our meeting
Is Bridgenorth and Harry you shall march
Through Gloucestershire by which account
Our business valued some twelve days hence
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet
Our hands are full of business lets away

Exit PRINCE HENRY
Rare words brave world Hostess my breakfast come
O I could wish this tavern were my drum
Exit
Enter HOTSPUR WORCESTER and DOUGLAS
Well said my noble Scot if speaking truth
In this fine age were not thought flattery
Such attribution should the Douglas have
As not a soldier of this seasons stamp
Should go so general current through the world
By God I cannot flatter I do defy
The tongues of soothers but a braver place
In my hearts love hath no man than yourself
Nay task me to my word approve me lord
Thou art the king of honour
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him
Do so and tis well
Enter a Messenger with letters
What letters hast thou thereI can but thank you
These letters come from your father
Letters from him why comes he not himself
He cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
Zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
In such a rustling time Who leads his power
Under whose government come they along
His letters bear his mind not I my lord
I prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
He did my lord four days ere I set forth
And at the time of my departure thence
He was much feard by his physicians
I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited
His health was never better worth than now
Sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
The very lifeblood of our enterprise
Tis catching hither even to our camp
He writes me here that inward sickness
And that his friends by deputation could not
So soon be drawn nor did he think it meet
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
On any soul removed but on his own
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement
That with our small conjunction we should on
To see how fortune is disposed to us
For as he writes there is no quailing now
Because the king is certainly possessd
Of all our purposes What say you to it
Your fathers sickness is a maim to us
A perilous gash a very limb loppd off
And yet in faith it is not his present want
Seems more than we shall find it were it good
All at one cast to set so rich a main
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
It were not good for therein should we read
The very bottom and the soul of hope
The very list the very utmost bound
Of all our fortunes
Faith and so we should
Where now remains a sweet reversion
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
Is to come in
A comfort of retirement lives in this
A rendezvous a home to fly unto
If that the devil and mischance look big
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs
But yet I would your father had been here
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division it will be thought
By some that know not why he is away
That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
And think how such an apprehension
And breed a kind of question in our cause
For well you know we of the offering side
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
And stop all sightholes every loop from whence
The eye of reason may pry in upon us
This absence of your fathers draws a curtain
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Before not dreamt of
You strain too far
I rather of his absence make this use
It lends a lustre and more great opinion
A larger dare to our great enterprise
Than if the earl were here for men must think
If we without his help can make a head
To push against a kingdom with his help
We shall oerturn it topsyturvy down
Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
As heart can think there is not such a word
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear
Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
My cousin Vernon welcome by my soul
Pray God my news be worth a welcome lord
The Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong
Is marching hitherwards with him Prince John
No harm what more
And further I have learnd
The king himself in person is set forth
Or hitherwards intended speedily
With strong and mighty preparation
He shall be welcome too Where is his son
The nimblefooted madcap Prince of Wales
And his comrades that daffd the world aside
And bid it pass
All furnishd all in arms
All plumed like estridges that with the wind
Baited like eagles having lately bathed
Glittering in golden coats like images
As full of spirit as the month of May
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
Wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
I saw young Harry with his beaver on
His cuisses on his thighs gallantly armd
Rise from the ground like featherd Mercury
And vaulted with such ease into his seat
As if an angel droppd down from the clouds
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
And witch the world with noble horsemanship
No more no more worse than the sun in March
This praise doth nourish agues Let them come
They come like sacrifices in their trim
And to the fireeyed maid of smoky war
All hot and bleeding will we offer them
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
Up to the ears in blood I am on fire
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
And yet not ours Come let me taste my horse
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales
Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse
Meet and neer part till one drop down a corse
O that Glendower were come
There is more news
I learnd in Worcester as I rode along
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days
Thats the worst tidings that I hear of yet
Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound
What may the kings whole battle reach unto
To thirty thousand
Forty let it be
My father and Glendower being both away
The powers of us may serve so great a day
Come let us take a muster speedily
Doomsday is near die all die merrily
Talk not of dying I am out of fear
Of death or deaths hand for this onehalf year
Exeunt
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
Bardolph get thee before to Coventry fill me a
bottle of sack our soldiers shall march through

An if it do take it for thy labour and if it make
twenty take them all Ill answer the coinage Bid
my lieutenant Peto meet me at towns end
I will captain farewell
Exit
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a soused
gurnet I have misused the kings press damnably
I have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty
soldiers three hundred and odd pounds I press me
none but good householders yeomans sons inquire
twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum such as
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
fowl or a hurt wildduck I pressed me none but such
toastsandbutter with hearts in their bellies no
bigger than pins heads and they have bought out
their services and now my whole charge consists of
ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of
companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth where the gluttons dogs licked his
sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but
discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to
younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers
tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and a
long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than
an old faced ancient and such have I to fill up
the rooms of them that have bought out their
services that you would think that I had a hundred
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swinekeeping from eating draff and husks A mad
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies No eye
hath seen such scarecrows Ill not march through
Coventry with them thats flat nay and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had
gyves on for indeed I had the most of them out of
prison Theres but a shirt and a half in all my
company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
heralds coat without sleeves and the shirt to say
the truth stolen from my host at Saint Albans or
the rednose innkeeper of Daventry But thats all
one theyll find linen enough on every hedge
Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
How now blown Jack how now quilt
What Hal how now mad wag what a devil dost thou
in Warwickshire My good Lord of Westmoreland I
cry you mercy I thought your honour had already been
at Shrewsbury
Faith Sir Johntis more than time that I were
there and you too but my powers are there already
The king I can tell you looks for us all we must
away all night
Tut never fear me I am as vigilant as a cat to
steal cream
I think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath
already made thee butter But tell me Jack whose
fellows are these that come after
Mine Hal mine
I did never see such pitiful rascals
Tut tut good enough to toss food for powder food
for powder theyll fill a pit as well as better
tush man mortal men mortal men
Ay but Sir John methinks they are exceeding poor
and bare too beggarly
Faith for their poverty I know not where they had
that and for their bareness I am sure they never
learned that of me
No Ill be sworn unless you call three fingers on
the ribs bare But sirrah make haste Percy is
already in the field
What is the king encamped
He is Sir John I fear we shall stay too long
Well
To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest
Exeunt
Enter HOTSPUR WORCESTER DOUGLAS and VERNON
Well fight with him tonight
It may not be
You give him then the advantage
Not a whit
Why say you so looks he not for supply
So do we
His is certain ours is doubtful
Good cousin be advised stir not tonight
Do not my lord
You do not counsel well
You speak it out of fear and cold heart
Do me no slander Douglas by my life
And I dare well maintain it with my life
If wellrespected honour bid me on
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
As you my lord or any Scot that this day lives
Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
Which of us fears
Yea or tonight
Content
Tonight say I
Come come it nay not be I wonder much
Being men of such great leading as you are
That you foresee not what impediments
Drag back our expedition certain horse
Of my cousin Vernons are not yet come up
Your uncle Worcesters horse came but today
And now their pride and mettle is asleep
Their courage with hard labour tame and dull
That not a horse is half the half of himself
So are the horses of the enemy
In general journeybated and brought low
The better part of ours are full of rest
The number of the king exceedeth ours
For Gods sake cousin stay till all come in
The trumpet sounds a parley
Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT
I come with gracious offers from the king
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
Welcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God
You were of our determination
Some of us love you well and even those some
Envy your great deservings and good name
Because you are not of our quality
But stand against us like an enemy
And God defend but still I should stand so
So long as out of limit and true rule
You stand against anointed majesty
But to my charge The king hath sent to know
The nature of your griefs and whereupon
You conjure from the breast of civil peace
Such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
Audacious cruelty If that the king
Have any way your good deserts forgot
Which he confesseth to be manifold
He bids you name your griefs and with all speed
You shall have your desires with interest
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
Herein misled by your suggestion
The king is kind and well we know the king
Knows at what time to promise when to pay
My father and my uncle and myself
Did give him that same royalty he wears
And when he was not six and twenty strong
Sick in the worlds regard wretched and low
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
My father gave him welcome to the shore
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster
To sue his livery and beg his peace
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal
My father in kind heart and pity moved
Swore him assistance and performd it too
Now when the lords and barons of the realm
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him
The more and less came in with cap and knee
Met him in boroughs cities villages
Attended him on bridges stood in lanes
Laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths
Gave him their heirs as pages followd him
Even at the heels in golden multitudes
He presently as greatness knows itself
Steps me a little higher than his vow
Made to my father while his blood was poor
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh
And now forsooth takes on him to reform
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth
Cries out upon abuses seems to weep
Over his countrys wrongs and by this face
This seeming brow of justice did he win
The hearts of all that he did angle for
Proceeded further cut me off the heads
Of all the favourites that the absent king
In deputation left behind him here
When he was personal in the Irish war
Tut I came not to hear this
Then to the point
In short time after he deposed the king
Soon after that deprived him of his life
And in the neck of that taskd the whole state
To make that worse sufferd his kinsman March
Who is if every owner were well placed
Indeed his king to be engaged in Wales
There without ransom to lie forfeited
Disgraced me in my happy victories
Sought to entrap me by intelligence
Rated mine uncle from the councilboard
In rage dismissd my father from the court
Broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
This head of safety and withal to pry
Into his title the which we find
Too indirect for long continuance
Shall I return this answer to the king
Not so Sir Walter well withdraw awhile
Go to the king and let there be impawnd
Some surety for a safe return again
And in the morning early shall my uncle
Bring him our purposes and so farewell
I would you would accept of grace and love
And may be so we shall
Pray God you do
Exeunt
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
Hie good Sir Michael bear this sealed brief
With winged haste to the lord marshal
This to my cousin Scroop and all the rest
To whom they are directed If you knew
How much they do to import you would make haste
My good lord
I guess their tenor
Like enough you do
Tomorrow good Sir Michael is a day
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury
As I am truly given to understand
The king with mighty and quickraised power
Meets with Lord Harry and I fear Sir Michael
What with the sickness of Northumberland
Whose power was in the first proportion
And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence
Who with them was a rated sinew too
And comes not in oerruled by prophecies
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
To wage an instant trial with the king
Why my good lord you need not fear
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer
No Mortimer is not there
But there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy
And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
Of gallant warriors noble gentlemen
And so there is but yet the king hath drawn
The special head of all the land together
The Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt
And moe corrivals and dear men
Of estimation and command in arms
Doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed
I hope no less yet needful tis to fear
And to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed
For if Lord Percy thrive not ere the king
Dismiss his power he means to visit us
For he hath heard of our confederacy
And tis but wisdom to make strong against him
Therefore make haste I must go write again
To other friends and so farewell Sir Michael
Exeunt
Enter KING HENRY PRINCE HENRY Lord John of  LANCASTER EARL OF WESTMORELAND SIR WALTER BLUNT and FALSTAFF
How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Above yon busky hill the day looks pale
At his distemperature
The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day
Then with the losers let it sympathize
For nothing can seem foul to those that win
The trumpet sounds
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
How now my Lord of Worcester tis not well
That you and I should meet upon such terms
As now we meet You have deceived our trust
And made us doff our easy robes of peace
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
This is not well my lord this is not well
What say you to it will you again unknit
This curlish knot of allabhorred war
And move in that obedient orb again
Where you did give a fair and natural light
And be no more an exhaled meteor
A prodigy of fear and a portent
Of broached mischief to the unborn times
Hear me my liege
For mine own part I could be well content
To entertain the lagend of my life
With quiet hours for I do protest
I have not sought the day of this dislike
You have not sought it how comes it then
Rebellion lay in his way and he found it
Peace chewet peace
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
Of favour from myself and all our house
And yet I must remember you my lord
We were the first and dearest of your friends
For you my staff of office did I break
In Richards time and posted day and night
to meet you on the way and kiss your hand
When yet you were in place and in account
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I
It was myself my brother and his son
That brought you home and boldly did outdare
The dangers of the time You swore to us
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster
That you did nothing purpose gainst the state
Nor claim no further than your newfalln right
The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster
To this we swore our aid But in short space
It raind down fortune showering on your head
And such a flood of greatness fell on you
What with our help what with the absent king
What with the injuries of a wanton time
The seeming sufferances that you had borne
And the contrarious winds that held the king
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
That all in England did repute him dead
And from this swarm of fair advantages
You took occasion to be quickly wood
To gripe the general sway into your hand
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster
And being fed by us you used us so
As that ungentle hull the cuckoos bird
Useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love durst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
We were enforced for safety sake to fly
Out of sight and raise this present head
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
As you yourself have forged against yourself
By unkind usage dangerous countenance
And violation of all faith and troth
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise
These things indeed you have articulate
Proclaimd at marketcrosses read in churches
To face the garment of rebellion
With some fine colour that may please the eye
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
Of hurlyburly innovation
And never yet did insurrection want
Such watercolours to impaint his cause
Nor moody beggars starving for a time
Of pellmell havoc and confusion
In both your armies there is many a soul
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter
If once they join in trial Tell your nephew
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
In praise of Henry Percy by my hopes
This present enterprise set off his head
I do not think a braver gentleman
More daring or more bold is now alive
To grace this latter age with noble deeds
For my part I may speak it to my shame
I have a truant been to chivalry
And so I hear he doth account me too
Yet this before my fathers majesty
I am content that he shall take the odds
Of his great name and estimation
And will to save the blood on either side
Try fortune with him in a single fight
And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee
Albeit considerations infinite
Do make against it No good Worcester no
We love our people well even those we love
That are misled upon your cousins part
And will they take the offer of our grace
Both he and they and you every man
Shall be my friend again and Ill be his
So tell your cousin and bring me word
What he will do but if he will not yield
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
And they shall do their office So be gone
We will not now be troubled with reply
We offer fair take it advisedly
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
It will not be accepted on my life
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
Are confident against the world in arms
Hence therefore every leader to his charge
For on their answer will we set on them
And God befriend us as our cause is just
Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF
Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
me so tis a point of friendship
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship
Say thy prayers and farewell
I  would twere bedtime Hal and all well
Why thou owest God a death
Exit PRINCE HENRY
Tis not due yet I would be loath to pay him before
his day What need I be so forward with him that
calls not on me Well tis no matter honour pricks
me on Yea but how if honour prick me off when I
come on how then Can honour set to a leg no or
an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no
Honour hath no skill in surgery then no What is
honour a word What is in that word honour what
is that honour air A trim reckoning Who hath it
he that died o Wednesday Doth he feel it no
Doth he hear it no Tis insensible then Yea
to the dead But will it not live with the living
Ill none of it Honour is a mere scutcheon and so
ends my catechism
Exit
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard
The liberal and kind offer of the king
Twere best he did
Then are we all undone
It is not possible it cannot be
The king should keep his word in loving us
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offence in other faults
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
For treason is but trusted like the fox
Who neer so tame so cherishd and lockd up
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors
Look how we can or sad or merrily
Interpretation will misquote our looks
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall
The better cherishd still the nearer death
My nephews trespass may be well forgot
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
And an adopted name of privilege
A hairbraind Hotspur governd by a spleen
All his offences live upon my head
And on his fathers we did train him on
And his corruption being taen from us
We as the spring of all shall pay for all
Therefore good cousin let not Harry know
In any case the offer of the king
Deliver what you will Ill say tis so
Here comes your cousin
Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS
My uncle is returnd
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland
Uncle what news
The king will bid you battle presently
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland
Lord Douglas go you and tell him so
Marry and shall and very willingly
Exit
There is no seeming mercy in the king
Did you beg any God forbid
I told him gently of our grievances
Of his oathbreaking which he mended thus
By now forswearing that he is forsworn
He calls us rebels traitors and will scourge
With haughty arms this hateful name in us
Reenter the EARL OF DOUGLAS
Arm gentlemen to arms for I have thrown
A brave defiance in King Henrys teeth
And Westmoreland that was engaged did bear it
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
The Prince of Wales steppd forth before the king
And nephew challenged you to single fight
O would the quarrel lay upon our heads
And that no man might draw short breath today
But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me
How showd his tasking seemd it in contempt
No by my soul I never in my life
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly
Unless a brother should a brother dare
To gentle exercise and proof of arms
He gave you all the duties of a man
Trimmd up your praises with a princely tongue
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle
Making you ever better than his praise
By still dispraising praise valued in you
And which became him like a prince indeed
He made a blushing cital of himself
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
As if he masterd there a double spirit
Of teaching and of learning instantly
There did he pause but let me tell the world
If he outlive the envy of this day
England did never owe so sweet a hope
So much misconstrued in his wantonness
Cousin I think thou art enamoured
On his follies never did I hear
Of any prince so wild a libertine
But be he as he will yet once ere night
I will embrace him with a soldiers arm
That he shall shrink under my courtesy
Arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
Better consider what you have to do
Than I that have not well the gift of tongue
Can lift your blood up with persuasion
Enter a Messenger
My lord here are letters for you
I cannot read them now
O gentlemen the time of life is short
To spend that shortness basely were too long
If life did ride upon a dials point
Still ending at the arrival of an hour
An if we live we live to tread on kings
If die brave death when princes die with us
Now for our consciences the arms are fair
When the intent of bearing them is just
Enter another Messenger
My lord prepare the king comes on apace
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale
For I profess not talking only this
Let each man do his best and here draw I
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
With the best blood that I can meet withal
In the adventure of this perilous day
Now Esperance Percy and set on
Sound all the lofty instruments of war
And by that music let us all embrace
For heaven to earth some of us never shall
A second time do such a courtesy
The trumpets sound They embrace and exeunt
KING HENRY enters with his power Alarum to the battle Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT
What is thy name that in the battle thus
Thou crossest me what honour dost thou seek
Upon my head
Know then my name is Douglas
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king
They tell thee true
The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought
Thy likeness for instead of thee King Harry
This sword hath ended him so shall it thee
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner
I was not born a yielder thou proud Scot
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Lord Staffords death
They fight DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT Enter HOTSPUR
O Douglas hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus
never had triumphd upon a Scot
Alls done alls won here breathless lies the king
Where
Here
This Douglas no I know this face full well
A gallant knight he was his name was Blunt
Semblably furnishd like the king himself
A fool go with thy soul whither it goes
A borrowd title hast thou bought too dear
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king
The king hath many marching in his coats
Now by my sword I will kill all his coats
Ill murder all his wardrobe piece by piece
Until I meet the king
Up and away
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day
Exeunt
Alarum Enter FALSTAFF solus
Though I could scape shotfree at London I fear

Soft who are you Sir Walter Blunt theres honour

led my ragamuffins where they are peppered theres
not three of my hundred and fifty left alive and
they are for the towns end to beg during life
But who comes here
Enter PRINCE HENRY
What standst thou idle here lend me thy sword
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies
Whose deaths are yet unrevenged I prithee
lend me thy sword
O Hal I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
done this day I have paid Percy I have made him sure
He is indeed and living to kill thee I prithee
lend me thy sword
Nay before God Hal if Percy be alive thou getst
not my sword but take my pistol if thou wilt
Give it to me what is it in the case
Ay Hal tis hot tis hot theres that will sack a city
PRINCE HENRY draws it out and finds it to be a bottle of sack
What is it a time to jest and dally now
He throws the bottle at him Exit
Well if Percy be alive Ill pierce him If he do
come in my way so if he do not if I come in his
willingly let him make a carbonado of me I like
not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath give me
life which if I can save so if not honour comes
unlooked for and theres an end
Exit FALSTAFF
Alarum Excursions Enter PRINCE HENRY LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER and EARL OF WESTMORELAND
I prithee
Harry withdraw thyself thou bleedst too much
Lord John of Lancaster go you with him
Not I my lord unless I did bleed too
I beseech your majesty make up
Lest your retirement do amaze your friends
I will do so
My Lord of Westmoreland lead him to his tent
Come my lord Ill lead you to your tent
Lead me my lord I do not need your help
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this
Where staind nobility lies trodden on
and rebels arms triumph in massacres
We breathe too long come cousin Westmoreland
Our duty this way lies for Gods sake come
Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
By God thou hast deceived me Lancaster
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit
Before I loved thee as a brother John
But now I do respect thee as my soul
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
Of such an ungrown warrior
O this boy
Lends mettle to us all
Exit
Enter DOUGLAS
Another king they grow like Hydras heads
I am the Douglas fatal to all those
That wear those colours on them what art thou
That counterfeitst the person of a king
The king himself who Douglas grieves at heart
So many of his shadows thou hast met
And not the very king I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field
But seeing thou fallst on me so luckily
I will assay thee so defend thyself
I fear thou art another counterfeit
And yet in faith thou bearst thee like a king
But mine I am sure thou art whoeer thou be
And thus I win thee
They fight KING HENRY being in danger PRINCE HENRY enters
Hold up thy head vile Scot or thou art like
Never to hold it up again the spirits
Of valiant Shirley Stafford Blunt are in my arms
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee
Who never promiseth but he means to pay
They fight DOUGLAS flies
Cheerly my lordhow fares your grace
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent
And so hath Clifton Ill to Clifton straight
Stay and breathe awhile
Thou hast redeemd thy lost opinion
And showd thou makest some tender of my life
In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me
O God they did me too much injury
That ever said I hearkend for your death
If it were so I might have let alone
The insulting hand of Douglas over you
Which would have been as speedy in your end
As all the poisonous potions in the world
And saved the treacherous labour of your son
Make up to Clifton Ill to Sir Nicholas Gawsey
Exit
Enter HOTSPUR
If I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouth
Thou speakst as if I would deny my name
My name is Harry Percy
Why then I see
A very valiant rebel of the name
I am the Prince of Wales and think not Percy
To share with me in glory any more
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere
Nor can one England brook a double reign
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales
Nor shall it Harry for the hour is come
To end the one of us and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine
Ill make it greater ere I part from thee
And all the budding honours on thy crest
Ill crop to make a garland for my head
I can no longer brook thy vanities
They fight
Enter FALSTAFF
Well said Hal to it Hal Nay you shall find no
boys play here I can tell you
Reenter DOUGLAS he fights with FALSTAFF  who falls down as if he were dead and exit DOUGLAS HOTSPUR is wounded and falls
O Harry thou hast robbd me of my youth
I better brook the loss of brittle life
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me
They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh
But thoughts the slave of life and life times fool
And time that takes survey of all the world
Must have a stop O I could prophesy
But that the earthy and cold hand of death
Lies on my tongue no Percy thou art dust
And food for
Dies
For worms brave Percy fare thee well great heart
Illweaved ambition how much art thou shrunk
When that this body did contain a spirit
A kingdom for it was too small a bound
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough this earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman
If thou wert sensible of courtesy
I should not make so dear a show of zeal
But let my favours hide thy mangled face
And even in thy behalf Ill thank myself
For doing these fair rites of tenderness
Adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
But not rememberd in thy epitaph
He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
What old acquaintance could not all this flesh
Keep in a little life Poor Jack farewell
I could have better spared a better man
O I should have a heavy miss of thee
If I were much in love with vanity
Death hath not struck so fat a deer today
Though many dearer in this bloody fray
Embowelld will I see thee by and by
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie
Exit PRINCE HENRY
Rising up  Embowelled if thou embowel me today
Ill give you leave to powder me and eat me too
tomorrow Sbloodtwas time to counterfeit or
that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too
Counterfeit I lie I am no counterfeit to die
is to be a counterfeit for he is but the
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man
but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and
perfect image of life indeed The better part of
valour is discretion in the which better part I
have saved my lifeZounds I am afraid of this
gunpowder Percy though he be dead how if he
should counterfeit too and rise by my faith I am
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit
Therefore Ill make him sure yea and Ill swear I
killed him Why may not he rise as well as I
Nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me
Therefore sirrah
Stabbing him
with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me
Takes up HOTSPUR on his back
Reenter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
Come brother John full bravely hast thou fleshd
Thy maiden sword
But soft whom have we here
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead
I did I saw him dead
Breathless and bleeding on the ground Art
thou alive
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight
I prithee speak we will not trust our eyes
Without our ears thou art not what thou seemst
No thats certain I am not a double man but if I
be not Jack Falstaff then am I a Jack There is Percy
Throwing the body down
if your father will do me any honour so if not let
him kill the next Percy himself I look to be either
earl or duke I can assure you
Why Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead
Didst thou Lord Lord how this world is given to
lying I grant you I was down and out of breath
and so was he but we rose both at an instant and
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock If I may be
believed so if not let them that should reward
valour bear the sin upon their own heads Ill take
it upon my death I gave him this wound in the
thigh if the man were alive and would deny it
zounds I would make him eat a piece of my sword
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard
This is the strangest fellow brother John
Come bring your luggage nobly on your back
For my part if a lie may do thee grace
Ill gild it with the happiest terms I have
A retreat is sounded
The trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
Come brother let us to the highest of the field
To see what friends are living who are dead
Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER
Ill follow as they say for reward He that
rewards me God reward him If I do grow great
Ill grow less for Ill purge and leave sack and
live cleanly as a nobleman should do
Exit
The trumpets sound Enter KING HENRY IV PRINCE  HENRY LORD JOHN LANCASTER EARL OF WESTMORELAND with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke
Illspirited Worcester did not we send grace
Pardon and terms of love to all of you
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsmans trust
Three knights upon our party slain today
A noble earl and many a creature else
Had been alive this hour
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
Betwixt our armies true intelligence
What I have done my safety urged me to
And I embrace this fortune patiently
Since not to be avoided it falls on me
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too
Other offenders we will pause upon
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON guarded
How goes the field
The noble Scot Lord Douglas when he saw
The fortune of the day quite turnd from him
The noble Percy slain and all his men
Upon the foot of fear fled with the rest
And falling from a hill he was so bruised
That the pursuers took him At my tent
The Douglas is and I beseech your grace
I may dispose of him
With all my heart
Then brother John of Lancaster to you
This honourable bounty shall belong
Go to the Douglas and deliver him
Up to his pleasure ransomless and free
His valour shown upon our crests today
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
Even in the bosom of our adversaries
I thank your grace for this high courtesy
Which I shall give away immediately
Then this remains that we divide our power
You son John and my cousin Westmoreland
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop
Who as we hear are busily in arms
Myself and you son Harry will towards Wales
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway
Meeting the cheque of such another day
And since this business so fair is done
Let us not leave till all our own be won
Exeunt
Dead March Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the  Fifth attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD Regent of  France GLOUCESTER Protector and EXETER Earl of WARWICK the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER Heralds  and c
Hung be the heavens with black yield day to night
Comets importing change of times and states
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
That have consented unto Henrys death
King Henry the Fifth too famous to live long
England neer lost a king of so much worth
England neer had a king until his time
Virtue he had deserving to command
His brandishd sword did blind men with his beams
His arms spread wider than a dragons wings
His sparking eyes replete with wrathful fire
More dazzled and drove back his enemies
Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces
What should I say his deeds exceed all speech
He neer lift up his hand but conquered
We mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
Henry is dead and never shall revive
Upon a wooden coffin we attend
And deaths dishonourable victory
We with our stately presence glorify
Like captives bound to a triumphant car
What shall we curse the planets of mishap
That plotted thus our glorys overthrow
Or shall we think the subtlewitted French
Conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
By magic verses have contrived his end
BISHOP
He was a king blessd of the King of kings
Unto the French the dreadful judgementday
So dreadful will not be as was his sight
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought
The churchs prayers made him so prosperous
The church where is it Had not churchmen prayd
His thread of life had not so soon decayd
None do you like but an effeminate prince
Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe
BISHOP
Gloucester whateer we like thou art protector
And lookest to command the prince and realm
Thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe
More than God or religious churchmen may
Name not religion for thou lovest the flesh
And neer throughout the year to church thou gost
Except it be to pray against thy foes
Cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
Lets to the altar heralds wait on us
Instead of gold well offer up our arms
Since arms avail not now that Henrys dead
Posterity await for wretched years
When at their mothers moist eyes babes shall suck
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears
And none but women left to wail the dead
Henry the Fifth thy ghost I invocate
Prosper this realm keep it from civil broils
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
Than Julius Caesar or bright
Enter a Messenger
My honourable lords health to you all
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France
Of loss of slaughter and discomfiture
Guienne Champagne Rheims Orleans
Paris Guysors Poictiers are all quite lost
What sayst thou man before dead Henrys corse
Speak softly or the loss of those great towns
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death
Is Paris lost is Rouen yielded up
If Henry were recalld to life again
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost
How were they lost what treachery was used
No treachery but want of men and money
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered
And whilst a field should be dispatchd and fought
You are disputing of your generals
One would have lingering wars with little cost
Another would fly swift but wanteth wings
A third thinks without expense at all
By guileful fair words peace may be obtaind
Awake awake English nobility
Let not sloth dim your horrors newbegot
Croppd are the flowerdeluces in your arms
Of Englands coat one half is cut away
Were our tears wanting to this funeral
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides
Me they concern Regent I am of France
Give me my steeled coat Ill fight for France
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes
To weep their intermissive miseries
Enter to them another Messenger
Lords view these letters full of bad mischance
France is revolted from the English quite
Except some petty towns of no import
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims
The Bastard of Orleans with him is joind
Reignier Duke of Anjou doth take his part
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side
The Dauphin crowned king all fly to him
O whither shall we fly from this reproach
We will not fly but to our enemies throats
Bedford if thou be slack Ill fight it out
Gloucester why doubtst thou of my forwardness
An army have I musterd in my thoughts
Wherewith already France is overrun
Enter another Messenger
My gracious lords to add to your laments
Wherewith you now bedew King Henrys hearse
I must inform you of a dismal fight
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French
BISHOP
What wherein Talbot overcame ist so
O no wherein Lord Talbot was oerthrown
The circumstance Ill tell you more at large
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord
Retiring from the siege of Orleans
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop
By three and twenty thousand of the French
Was round encompassed and set upon
No leisure had he to enrank his men
He wanted pikes to set before his archers
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluckd out of hedges
They pitched in the ground confusedly
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in
More than three hours the fight continued
Where valiant Talbot above human thought
Hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
Here there and every where enraged he flew
The French exclaimd the devil was in arms
All the whole army stood agazed on him
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
A Talbot a Talbot cried out amain
And rushd into the bowels of the battle
Here had the conquest fully been seald up
If Sir John Fastolfe had not playd the coward
He being in the vaward placed behind
With purpose to relieve and follow them
Cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre
Enclosed were they with their enemies
A base Walloon to win the Dauphins grace
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
Durst not presume to look once in the face
Is Talbot slain then I will slay myself
For living idly here in pomp and ease
Whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
Unto his dastard foemen is betrayd
O no he lives but is took prisoner
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford
Most of the rest slaughterd or took likewise
His ransom there is none but I shall pay
Ill hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend
Four of their lords Ill change for one of ours
Farewell my masters to my task will I
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make
To keep our great Saint Georges feast withal
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake
So you had need for Orleans is besieged
The English army is grown weak and faint
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny
Since they so few watch such a multitude
Remember lords your oaths to Henry sworn
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke
I do remember it and here take my leave
To go about my preparation
Exit
Ill to the Tower with all the haste I can
To view the artillery and munition
And then I will proclaim young Henry king
Exit
To Eltham will I where the young king is
Being ordaind his special governor
And for his safety there Ill best devise
Exit
BISHOP
Each hath his place and function to attend
I am left out for me nothing remains
But long I will not be Jack out of office
The king from Eltham I intend to steal
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal
Exeunt
Sound a flourish Enter CHARLES ALENCON and REIGNIER marching with drum and Soldiers
Mars his true moving even as in the heavens
So in the earth to this day is not known
Late did he shine upon the English side
Now we are victors upon us he smiles
What towns of any moment but we have
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans
Otherwhiles the famishd English like pale ghosts
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month
They want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves
Either they must be dieted like mules
And have their provender tied to their mouths
Or piteous they will look like drowned mice
Lets raise the siege why live we idly here
Talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
Remaineth none but madbraind Salisbury
And he may well in fretting spend his gall
Nor men nor money hath he to make war
Sound sound alarum we will rush on them
Now for the honour of the forlorn French
Him I forgive my death that killeth me
When he sees me go back one foot or fly
Exeunt
Here alarum they are beaten back by the English with great loss Reenter CHARLES ALENCON and REIGNIER
Who ever saw the like what men have I
Dogs cowards dastards I would neer have fled
But that they left me midst my enemies
Salisbury is a desperate homicide
He fighteth as one weary of his life
The other lords like lions wanting food
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey
Froissart a countryman of ours records
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred
During the time Edward the Third did reign
More truly now may this be verified
For none but Samsons and Goliases
It sendeth forth to skirmish One to ten
Lean rawboned rascals who would eer suppose
They had such courage and audacity
Lets leave this town for they are harebraind slaves
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager
Of old I know them rather with their teeth
The walls theyll tear down than forsake the siege
I think by some odd gimmors or device
Their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on
Else neer could they hold out so as they do
By my consent well even let them alone
Be it so
Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
Wheres the Prince Dauphin I have news for him
Bastard of Orleans thrice welcome to us
Methinks your looks are sad your cheer appalld
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
Be not dismayd for succor is at hand
A holy maid hither with me I bring
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
And drive the English forth the bounds of France
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome
Whats past and whats to come she can descry
Speak shall I call her in Believe my words
For they are certain and unfallible
Go call her in
Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS
But first to try her skill
Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place
Question her proudly let thy looks be stern
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath
Reenter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with JOAN LA PUCELLE
Fair maid ist thou wilt do these wondrous feats
Reignier ist thou that thinkest to beguile me
Where is the Dauphin Come come from behind
I know thee well though never seen before
Be not amazed theres nothing hid from me
In private will I talk with thee apart
Stand back you lords and give us leave awhile
She takes upon her bravely at first dash
Dauphin I am by birth a shepherds daughter
My wit untraind in any kind of art
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
To shine on my contemptible estate
Lo whilst I waited on my tender lambs
And to suns parching heat displayd my cheeks
Gods mother deigned to appear to me
And in a vision full of majesty
Willd me to leave my base vocation
And free my country from calamity
Her aid she promised and assured success
In complete glory she reveald herself
And whereas I was black and swart before
With those clear rays which she infused on me
That beauty am I blessd with which you see
Ask me what question thou canst possible
And I will answer unpremeditated
My courage try by combat if thou darest
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex
Resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate
Thou hast astonishd me with thy high terms
Only this proof Ill of thy valour make
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me
And if thou vanquishest thy words are true
Otherwise I renounce all confidence
I am prepared here is my keenedged sword
Deckd with five flowerdeluces on each side
The which at Touraine in Saint Katharines
churchyard
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth
Then come o Gods name I fear no woman
And while I live Ill neer fly from a man
Here they fight and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes
Stay stay thy hands thou art an Amazon
And fightest with the sword of Deborah
Christs mother helps me else I were too weak
Whoeer helps thee tis thou that must help me
Impatiently I burn with thy desire
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued
Excellent Pucelle if thy name be so
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be
Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus
I must not yield to any rites of love
For my professions sacred from above
When I have chased all thy foes from hence
Then will I think upon a recompense
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall
My lord methinks is very long in talk
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
Shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean
He may mean more than we poor men do know
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues
My lord where are you what devise you on
Shall we give over Orleans or no
Why no I say distrustful recreants
Fight till the last gasp I will be your guard
What she says Ill confirm well fight it out
Assignd am I to be the English scourge
This night the siege assuredly Ill raise
Expect Saint Martins summer halcyon days
Since I have entered into these wars
Glory is like a circle in the water
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
With Henrys death the English circle ends
Dispersed are the glories it included
Now am I like that proud insulting ship
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once
Was Mahomet inspired with a dove
Thou with an eagle art inspired then
Helen the mother of great Constantine
Nor yet Saint Philips daughters were like thee
Bright star of Venus falln down on the earth
How may I reverently worship thee enough
Leave off delays and let us raise the siege
Woman do what thou canst to save our honours
Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized
Presently well try come lets away about it
No prophet will I trust if she prove false
Exeunt
Enter GLOUCESTER with his Servingmen in blue coats
I am come to survey the Tower this day
Since Henrys death I fear there is conveyance
Where be these warders that they wait not here
Open the gates tis Gloucester that calls
Within  Whos there that knocks so imperiously
First ServingManIt is the noble Duke of Gloucester
Within  Whoeer he be you may not be let in
First ServingManVillains answer you so the lord protector
Within  The Lord protect him so we answer him
We do no otherwise than we are willd
Who willed you or whose will stands but mine
Theres none protector of the realm but I
Break up the gates Ill be your warrantize
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms
Gloucesters men rush at the Tower Gates and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within
What noise is this what traitors have we here
Lieutenant is it you whose voice I hear
Open the gates heres Gloucester that would enter
Have patience noble duke I may not open
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids
From him I have express commandment
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in
Fainthearted Woodvile prizest him fore me
Arrogant Winchester that haughty prelate
Whom Henry our late sovereign neer could brook
Thou art no friend to God or to the king
Open the gates or Ill shut thee out shortly
ServingMenOpen the gates unto the lord protector
Or well burst them open if that you come not quickly
Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats
BISHOP
How now ambitious Humphry what means this
Peeld priest dost thou command me to be shut out
BISHOP
I do thou most usurping proditor
And not protector of the king or realm
Stand back thou manifest conspirator
Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord
Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin
Ill canvass thee in thy broad cardinals hat
If thou proceed in this thy insolence
BISHOP
Nay stand thou back I will not budge a foot
This be Damascus be thou cursed Cain
To slay thy brother Abel if thou wilt
I will not slay thee but Ill drive thee back
Thy scarlet robes as a childs bearingcloth
Ill use to carry thee out of this place
BISHOP
Do what thou darest I beard thee to thy face
What am I dared and bearded to my face
Draw men for all this privileged place
Blue coats to tawny coats Priest beware your beard
I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly
Under my feet I stamp thy cardinals hat
In spite of pope or dignities of church
Here by the cheeks Ill drag thee up and down
BISHOP
Gloucester thou wilt answer this before the pope
Winchester goose I cry a rope a rope
Now beat them hence why do you let them stay
Thee Ill chase hence thou wolf in sheeps array
Out tawny coats out scarlet hypocrite
Here GLOUCESTERs men beat out BISHOP OF  WINCHESTERs men and enter in the hurly burly the Mayor of London and his Officers
Fie lords that you being supreme magistrates
Thus contumeliously should break the peace
Peace mayor thou knowst little of my wrongs
Heres Beaufort that regards nor God nor king
Hath here distraind the Tower to his use
BISHOP
Heres Gloucester a foe to citizens
One that still motions war and never peace
Oercharging your free purses with large fines
That seeks to overthrow religion
Because he is protector of the realm
And would have armour here out of the Tower
To crown himself king and suppress the prince
I will not answer thee with words but blows
Here they skirmish again
Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
But to make open proclamation
Come officer as loud as eer thou canst
Cry
All manner of men assembled here in arms this day
against Gods peace and the kings we charge and
command you in his highness name to repair to
your several dwellingplaces and not to wear
handle or use any sword weapon or dagger
henceforward upon pain of death
Cardinal Ill be no breaker of the law
But we shall meet and break our minds at large
BISHOP
Gloucester we will meet to thy cost be sure
Thy heartblood I will have for this days work
Ill call for clubs if you will not away
This cardinals more haughty than the devil
Mayor farewell thou dost but what thou mayst
BISHOP
Abominable Gloucester guard thy head
For I intend to have it ere long
Exeunt severally GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their Servingmen
See the coast cleard and then we will depart
Good God these nobles should such stomachs bear
I myself fight not once in forty year
Exeunt
Enter on the walls a Master Gunner and his Boy
MasterGunnerSirrah thou knowst how Orleans is besieged
And how the English have the suburbs won
Father I know and oft have shot at them
Howeer unfortunate I missd my aim
MasterGunnerBut now thou shalt not Be thou ruled by me
Chief mastergunner am I of this town
Something I must do to procure me grace
The princes espials have informed me
How the English in the suburbs close intrenchd
Wont through a secret grate of iron bars
In yonder tower to overpeer the city
And thence discover how with most advantage
They may vex us with shot or with assault
To intercept this inconvenience
A piece of ordnance gainst it I have placed
And even these three days have I watchd
If I could see them
Now do thou watch for I can stay no longer
If thou spyst any run and bring me word
And thou shalt find me at the governors
Exit
Father I warrant you take you no care
Ill never trouble you if I may spy them
Exit
Enter on the turrets SALISBURY and TALBOT GLANSDALE GARGRAVE and others
Talbot my life my joy again returnd
How wert thou handled being prisoner
Or by what means gotst thou to be released
Discourse I prithee on this turrets top
The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
Calld the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles
For him was I exchanged and ransomed
But with a baser man of arms by far
Once in contempt they would have barterd me
Which I disdaining scornd and craved death
Rather than I would be so vile esteemd
In fine redeemd I was as I desired
But O the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart
Whom with my bare fists I would execute
If I now had him brought into my power
Yet tellst thou not how thou wert entertaind
With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
In open marketplace produced they me
To be a public spectacle to all
Here said they is the terror of the French
The scarecrow that affrights our children so
Then broke I from the officers that led me
And with my nails diggd stones out of the ground
To hurl at the beholders of my shame
My grisly countenance made others fly
None durst come near for fear of sudden death
In iron walls they deemd me not secure
So great fear of my name mongst them was spread
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
That walked about me every minutewhile
And if I did but stir out of my bed
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart
Enter the Boy with a linstock
I grieve to hear what torments you endured
But we will be revenged sufficiently
Now it is suppertime in Orleans
Here through this grate I count each one
and view the Frenchmen how they fortify
Let us look in the sight will much delight thee
Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale
Let me have your express opinions
Where is best place to make our battery next
I think at the north gate for there stand lords
And I here at the bulwark of the bridge
For aught I see this city must be famishd
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled
Here they shoot SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall
O Lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
O Lord have mercy on me woful man
What chance is this that suddenly hath crossd us
Speak Salisbury at least if thou canst speak
How farest thou mirror of all martial men
One of thy eyes and thy cheeks side struck off
Accursed tower accursed fatal hand
That hath contrived this woful tragedy
In thirteen battles Salisbury oercame
Henry the Fifth he first traind to the wars
Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
His sword did neer leave striking in the field
Yet livest thou Salisbury though thy speech doth fail
One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world
Heaven be thou gracious to none alive
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
Bear hence his body I will help to bury it
Sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life
Speak unto Talbot nay look up to him
Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
Thou shalt not die whiles
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me
As who should say When I am dead and gone
Remember to avenge me on the French
Plantagenet I will and like thee Nero
Play on the lute beholding the towns burn
Wretched shall France be only in my name
Here an alarum and it thunders and lightens
What stir is this what tumults in the heavens
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise
Enter a Messenger
My lord my lord the French have gathered head
The Dauphin with one Joan la Pucelle joind
A holy prophetess new risen up
Is come with a great power to raise the siege
Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans
Hear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged
Frenchmen Ill be a Salisbury to you
Pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish
Your hearts Ill stamp out with my horses heels
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains
Convey me Salisbury into his tent
And then well try what these dastard Frenchmen dare
Alarum Exeunt
Here an alarum again and TALBOT pursueth the  DAUPHIN and driveth him then enter JOAN LA  PUCELLE driving Englishmen before her and exit after them then reenter TALBOT
Where is my strength my valour and my force
Our English troops retire I cannot stay them
A woman clad in armour chaseth them
Reenter JOAN LA PUCELLE
Here here she comes Ill have a bout with thee
Devil or devils dam Ill conjure thee
Blood will I draw on thee thou art a witch
And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest
Come come tis only I that must disgrace thee
Here they fight
Heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail
My breast Ill burst with straining of my courage
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder
But I will chastise this highminded strumpet
They fight again
Talbot farewell thy hour is not yet come
I must go victual Orleans forthwith
A short alarum then enter the town with soldiers
Oertake me if thou canst I scorn thy strength
Go go cheer up thy hungrystarved men
Help Salisbury to make his testament
This day is ours as many more shall be
Exit
My thoughts are whirled like a potters wheel
I know not where I am nor what I do
A witch by fear not force like Hannibal
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
Are from their hives and houses driven away
They calld us for our fierceness English dogs
Now like to whelps we crying run away
A short alarum
Hark countrymen either renew the fight
Or tear the lions out of Englands coat
Renounce your soil give sheep in lions stead
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
Or horse or oxen from the leopard
As you fly from your oftsubdued slaves
Alarum Here another skirmish
It will not be retire into your trenches
You all consented unto Salisburys death
For none would strike a stroke in his revenge
Pucelle is enterd into Orleans
In spite of us or aught that we could do
O would I were to die with Salisbury
The shame hereof will make me hide my head
Exit TALBOT Alarum retreat flourish
Enter on the walls JOAN LA PUCELLE CHARLES REIGNIER ALENCON and Soldiers
Advance our waving colours on the walls
Rescued is Orleans from the English
Thus Joan la Pucelle hath performd her word
Divinest creature Astraeas daughter
How shall I honour thee for this success
Thy promises are like Adonis gardens
That one day bloomd and fruitful were the next
France triumph in thy glorious prophetess
Recoverd is the town of Orleans
More blessed hap did neer befall our state
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town
Dauphin command the citizens make bonfires
And feast and banquet in the open streets
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us
All France will be replete with mirth and joy
When they shall hear how we have playd the men
Tis Joan not we by whom the day is won
For which I will divide my crown with her
And all the priests and friars in my realm
Shall in procession sing her endless praise
A statelier pyramis to her Ill rear
Than Rhodopes or Memphis ever was
In memory of her when she is dead
Her ashes in an urn more precious
Than the richjeweld of Darius
Transported shall be at high festivals
Before the kings and queens of France
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry
But Joan la Pucelle shall be Frances saint
Come in and let us banquet royally
After this golden day of victory
Flourish Exeunt
Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels
Sirs take your places and be vigilant
If any noise or soldier you perceive
Near to the walls by some apparent sign
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard
Sergeant you shall
Exit Sergeant
Thus are poor servitors
When others sleep upon their quiet beds
Constraind to watch in darkness rain and cold
Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY and Forces with scalingladders their drums beating a dead march
Lord Regent and redoubted Burgundy
By whose approach the regions of Artois
Wallon and Picardy are friends to us
This happy night the Frenchmen are secure
Having all day caroused and banqueted
Embrace we then this opportunity
As fitting best to quittance their deceit
Contrived by art and baleful sorcery
Coward of France how much he wrongs his fame
Despairing of his own arms fortitude
To join with witches and the help of hell
Traitors have never other company
But whats that Pucelle whom they term so pure
A maid they say
A maid and be so martial
Pray God she prove not masculine ere long
If underneath the standard of the French
She carry armour as she hath begun
God is our fortress in whose conquering name
Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks
Ascend brave Talbot we will follow thee
Not all together better far I guess
That we do make our entrance several ways
That if it chance the one of us do fail
The other yet may rise against their force
Agreed Ill to yond corner
And I to this
And here will Talbot mount or make his grave
Now Salisbury for thee and for the right
Of English Henry shall this night appear
How much in duty I am bound to both
Arm arm the enemy doth make assault
Cry St George A Talbot
The French leap over the walls in their shirts  Enter several ways the BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON and REIGNIER half ready and half unready
How now my lords what all unready so
Unready ay and glad we scaped so well
Twas time I trow to wake and leave our beds
Hearing alarums at our chamberdoors
Of all exploits since first I followd arms
Neer heard I of a warlike enterprise
More venturous or desperate than this
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell
If not of hell the heavens sure favour him
Here cometh Charles I marvel how he sped
Tut holy Joan was his defensive guard
Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE
Is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
Didst thou at first to flatter us withal
Make us partakers of a little gain
That now our loss might be ten times so much
Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend
At all times will you have my power alike
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me
Improvident soldiers had your watch been good
This sudden mischief never could have falln
Duke of Alencon this was your default
That being captain of the watch tonight
Did look no better to that weighty charge
Had all your quarters been as safely kept
As that whereof I had the government
We had not been thus shamefully surprised
Mine was secure
And so was mine my lord
And for myself most part of all this night
Within her quarter and mine own precinct
I was employd in passing to and fro
About relieving of the sentinels
Then how or which way should they first break in
Question my lords no further of the case
How or which way tis sure they found some place
But weakly guarded where the breach was made
And now there rests no other shift but this
To gather our soldiers scatterd and dispersed
And lay new platforms to endamage them
Alarum Enter an English Soldier crying A  Talbot a Talbot They fly leaving their clothes behind
Ill be so bold to take what they have left
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword
For I have loaden me with many spoils
Using no other weapon but his name
Exit
Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY a Captain and others
The day begins to break and night is fled
Whose pitchy mantle overveild the earth
Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit
Retreat sounded
Bring forth the body of old Salisbury
And here advance it in the marketplace
The middle centre of this cursed town
Now have I paid my vow unto his soul
For every drop of blood was drawn from him
There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight
And that hereafter ages may behold
What ruin happend in revenge of him
Within their chiefest temple Ill erect
A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interrd
Upon the which that every one may read
Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans
The treacherous manner of his mournful death
And what a terror he had been to France
But lords in all our bloody massacre
I muse we met not with the Dauphins grace
His newcome champion virtuous Joan of Arc
Nor any of his false confederates
Tis thought Lord Talbot when the fight began
Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds
They did amongst the troops of armed men
Leap oer the walls for refuge in the field
Myself as far as I could well discern
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night
Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running
Like to a pair of loving turtledoves
That could not live asunder day or night
After that things are set in order here
Well follow them with all the power we have
Enter a Messenger
All hail my lords which of this princely train
So much applauded through the realm of France
Here is the Talbot who would speak with him
The virtuous lady Countess of Auvergne
With modesty admiring thy renown
By me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
To visit her poor castle where she lies
That she may boast she hath beheld the man
Whose glory fills the world with loud report
Is it even so Nay then I see our wars
Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport
When ladies crave to be encounterd with
You may not my lord despise her gentle suit
Neer trust me then for when a world of men
Could not prevail with all their oratory
Yet hath a womans kindness overruled
And therefore tell her I return great thanks
And in submission will attend on her
Will not your honours bear me company
No truly it is more than manners will
And I have heard it said unbidden guests
Are often welcomest when they are gone
Well then alone since theres no remedy
I mean to prove this ladys courtesy
Come hither captain
Whispers
You perceive my mind
I do my lord and mean accordingly
Exeunt
Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter
COUNTESS
Porter remember what I gave in charge
And when you have done so bring the keys to me
Madam I will
Exit
COUNTESS
The plot is laid if all things fall out right
I shall as famous be by this exploit
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus death
Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight
And his achievements of no less account
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
To give their censure of these rare reports
Enter Messenger and TALBOT
Madam
According as your ladyship desired
By message craved so is Lord Talbot come
COUNTESS
And he is welcome What is this the man
Madam it is
COUNTESS
Is this the scourge of France
Is this the Talbot so much feard abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes
I see report is fabulous and false
I thought I should have seen some Hercules
A second Hector for his grim aspect
And large proportion of his strongknit limbs
Alas this is a child a silly dwarf
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies
Madam I have been bold to trouble you
But since your ladyship is not at leisure
Ill sort some other time to visit you
COUNTESS
What means he now Go ask him whither he goes
Stay my Lord Talbot for my lady craves
To know the cause of your abrupt departure
Marry for that shes in a wrong belief
I go to certify her Talbots here
Reenter Porter with keys
COUNTESS
If thou be he then art thou prisoner
Prisoner to whom
COUNTESS
To me bloodthirsty lord
And for that cause I trained thee to my house
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
For in my gallery thy picture hangs
But now the substance shall endure the like
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine
That hast by tyranny these many years
Wasted our country slain our citizens
And sent our sons and husbands captivate
Ha ha ha
COUNTESS
Laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moan
I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
To think that you have aught but Talbots shadow
COUNTESS
Why art not thou the man
I am indeed
COUNTESS
Then have I substance too
No no I am but shadow of myself
You are deceived my substance is not here
For what you see is but the smallest part
And least proportion of humanity
I tell you madam were the whole frame here
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch
Your roof were not sufficient to containt
COUNTESS
This is a riddling merchant for the nonce
He will be here and yet he is not here
How can these contrarieties agree
That will I show you presently
Winds his horn Drums strike up a peal of ordnance Enter soldiers
How say you madam are you now persuaded
That Talbot is but shadow of himself
These are his substance sinews arms and strength
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks
Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
And in a moment makes them desolate
COUNTESS
Victorious Talbot pardon my abuse
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
And more than may be gatherd by thy shape
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
For I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art
Be not dismayd fair lady nor misconstrue
The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
The outward composition of his body
What you have done hath not offended me
But only with your patience that we may
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have
For soldiers stomachs always serve them well
COUNTESS
With all my heart and think me honoured
To feast so great a warrior in my house
Exeunt
Enter the Earls of SOMERSET SUFFOLK and WARWICK RICHARD PLANTAGENET VERNON and another Lawyer
RICHARD
Great lords and gentlemen what means this silence
Dare no man answer in a case of truth
Within the Templehall we were too loud
The garden here is more convenient
RICHARD
Then say at once if I maintaind the truth
Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error
Faith I have been a truant in the law
And never yet could frame my will to it
And therefore frame the law unto my will
Judge you my Lord of Warwick then between us
Between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
Between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
Between two blades which bears the better temper
Between two horses which doth bear him best
Between two girls which hath the merriest eye
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law
Good faith I am no wiser than a daw
RICHARD
Tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
The truth appears so naked on my side
That any purblind eye may find it out
And on my side it is so well apparelld
So clear so shining and so evident
That it will glimmer through a blind mans eye
RICHARD
Since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
Let him that is a trueborn gentleman
And stands upon the honour of his birth
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth
From off this brier pluck a white rose with me
Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
But dare maintain the party of the truth
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
I love no colours and without all colour
Of base insinuating flattery
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet
I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
And say withal I think he held the right
Stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
Till you conclude that he upon whose side
The fewest roses are croppd from the tree
Shall yield the other in the right opinion
Good Master Vernon it is well objected
If I have fewest I subscribe in silence
RICHARD
And I
Then for the truth and plainness of the case
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
Giving my verdict on the white rose side
Prick not your finger as you pluck it off
Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
And fall on my side so against your will
If I my lord for my opinion bleed
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
And keep me on the side where still I am
Well well come on who else
Unless my study and my books be false
The argument you held was wrong in you
To SOMERSET
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too
RICHARD
Now Somerset where is your argument
Here in my scabbard meditating that
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
RICHARD
Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses
For pale they look with fear as witnessing
The truth on our side
No Plantagenet
Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
RICHARD
Hath not thy rose a canker Somerset
Hath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet
RICHARD
Ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
Well Ill find friends to wear my bleeding roses
That shall maintain what I have said is true
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen
RICHARD
Now by this maiden blossom in my hand
I scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
Turn not thy scorns this way Plantagenet
RICHARD
Proud Pole I will and scorn both him and thee
Ill turn my part thereof into thy throat
Away away good William de la Pole
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him
Now by Gods will thou wrongst him Somerset
His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence
Third son to the third Edward King of England
Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
RICHARD
He bears him on the places privilege
Or durst not for his craven heart say thus
By him that made me Ill maintain my words
On any plot of ground in Christendom
Was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge
For treason executed in our late kings days
And by his treason standst not thou attainted
Corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
And till thou be restored thou art a yeoman
RICHARD
My father was attached not attainted
Condemnd to die for treason but no traitor
And that Ill prove on better men than Somerset
Were growing time once ripend to my will
For your partaker Pole and you yourself
Ill note you in my book of memory
To scourge you for this apprehension
Look to it well and say you are well warnd
Ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still
And know us by these colours for thy foes
For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
RICHARD
And by my soul this pale and angry rose
As cognizance of my blooddrinking hate
Until it wither with me to my grave
Or flourish to the height of my degree
Go forward and be choked with thy ambition
And so farewell until I meet thee next
Exit
Have with thee Pole Farewell ambitious Richard
Exit
RICHARD
How I am braved and must perforce endure it
This blot that they object against your house
Shall be wiped out in the next parliament
Calld for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester
And if thou be not then created York
I will not live to be accounted Warwick
Meantime in signal of my love to thee
Against proud Somerset and William Pole
Will I upon thy party wear this rose
And here I prophesy this brawl today
Shall send between the red rose and the white
A thousand souls to death and deadly night
RICHARD
Good Master Vernon I am bound to you
That you on my behalf would pluck a flower
In your behalf still will I wear the same
And so will I
RICHARD
Thanks gentle sir
Come let us four to dinner I dare say
This quarrel will drink blood another day
Exeunt
Enter MORTIMER brought in a chair and Gaolers
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age
Let dying Mortimer here rest himself
Even like a man new haled from the rack
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment
And these grey locks the pursuivants of death
Nestorlike aged in an age of care
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer
These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
Wax dim as drawing to their exigent
Weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief
And pithless arms like to a witherd vine
That droops his sapless branches to the ground
Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
Unable to support this lump of clay
Swiftwinged with desire to get a grave
As witting I no other comfort have
But tell me keeper will my nephew come
Richard Plantagenet my lord will come
We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber
And answer was returnd that he will come
Enough my soul shall then be satisfied
Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign
Before whose glory I was great in arms
This loathsome sequestration have I had
And even since then hath Richard been obscured
Deprived of honour and inheritance
But now the arbitrator of despairs
Just death kind umpire of mens miseries
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
I would his troubles likewise were expired
That so he might recover what was lost
Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
My lord your loving nephew now is come
Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come
RICHARD
Ay noble uncle thus ignobly used
Your nephew late despised Richard comes
Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp
O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss
And now declare sweet stem from Yorks great stock
Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised
RICHARD
First lean thine aged back against mine arm
And in that ease Ill tell thee my disease
This day in argument upon a case
Some words there grew twixt Somerset and me
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
And did upbraid me with my fathers death
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue
Else with the like I had requited him
Therefore good uncle for my fathers sake
In honour of a true Plantagenet
And for alliance sake declare the cause
My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head
That cause fair nephew that imprisond me
And hath detaind me all my flowering youth
Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
Was cursed instrument of his decease
RICHARD
Discover more at large what cause that was
For I am ignorant and cannot guess
I will if that my fading breath permit
And death approach not ere my tale be done
Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king
Deposed his nephew Richard Edwards son
The firstbegotten and the lawful heir
Of Edward king the third of that descent
During whose reign the Percies of the north
Finding his usurpation most unjust
Endeavord my advancement to the throne
The reason moved these warlike lords to this
Was for thatyoung King Richard thus removed
Leaving no heir begotten of his body
I was the next by birth and parentage
For by my mother I derived am
From Lionel Duke of Clarence the third son
To King Edward the Third whereas he
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree
Being but fourth of that heroic line
But mark as in this haughty attempt
They laboured to plant the rightful heir
I lost my liberty and they their lives
Long after this when Henry the Fifth
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign
Thy father Earl of Cambridge then derived
From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York
Marrying my sister that thy mother was
Again in pity of my hard distress
Levied an army weening to redeem
And have installd me in the diadem
But as the rest so fell that noble earl
And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers
In whom the tide rested were suppressd
RICHARD
Of which my lord your honour is the last
True and thou seest that I no issue have
And that my fainting words do warrant death
Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather
But yet be wary in thy studious care
RICHARD
Thy grave admonishments prevail with me
But yet methinks my fathers execution
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny
With silence nephew be thou politic
Strongfixed is the house of Lancaster
And like a mountain not to be removed
But now thy uncle is removing hence
As princes do their courts when they are cloyd
With long continuance in a settled place
RICHARD
O uncle would some part of my young years
Might but redeem the passage of your age
Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill
Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good
Only give order for my funeral
And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war
Dies
RICHARD
And peace no war befall thy parting soul
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
And like a hermit overpassd thy days
Well I will lock his counsel in my breast
And what I do imagine let that rest
Keepers convey him hence and I myself
Will see his burial better than his life
Exeunt Gaolers bearing out the body of MORTIMER
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer
Choked with ambition of the meaner sort
And for those wrongs those bitter injuries
Which Somerset hath offerd to my house
I doubt not but with honour to redress
And therefore haste I to the parliament
Either to be restored to my blood
Or make my ill the advantage of my good
Exit
Flourish Enter KING HENRY VI EXETER GLOUCESTER  WARWICK SOMERSET and SUFFOLK the BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER RICHARD PLANTAGENET and others  GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it and tears it
BISHOP
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines
With written pamphlets studiously devised
Humphrey of Gloucester If thou canst accuse
Or aught intendst to lay unto my charge
Do it without invention suddenly
As I with sudden and extemporal speech
Purpose to answer what thou canst object
Presumptuous priest this place commands my patience
Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonourd me
Think not although in writing I preferrd
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
That therefore I have forged or am not able
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
No prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
Thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
As very infants prattle of thy pride
Thou art a most pernicious usurer
Forward by nature enemy to peace
Lascivious wanton more than well beseems
A man of thy profession and degree
And for thy treachery whats more manifest
In that thou laidst a trap to take my life
As well at London bridge as at the Tower
Beside I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
The king thy sovereign is not quite exempt
From envious malice of thy swelling heart
BISHOP
Gloucester I do defy thee Lords vouchsafe
To give me hearing what I shall reply
If I were covetous ambitious or perverse
As he will have me how am I so poor
Or how haps it I seek not to advance
Or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
And for dissension who preferreth peace
More than I doexcept I be provoked
No my good lords it is not that offends
It is not that that hath incensed the duke
It is because no one should sway but he
No one but he should be about the king
And that engenders thunder in his breast
And makes him roar these accusations forth
But he shall know I am as good
As good
Thou bastard of my grandfather
BISHOP
Ay lordly sir for what are you I pray
But one imperious in anothers throne
Am I not protector saucy priest
BISHOP
And am not I a prelate of the church
Yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
And useth it to patronage his theft
BISHOP
Unreverent Gloster
Thou art reverent
Touching thy spiritual function not thy life
BISHOP
Rome shall remedy this
Roam thither then
My lord it were your duty to forbear
Ay see the bishop be not overborne
Methinks my lord should be religious
And know the office that belongs to such
Methinks his lordship should be humbler
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead
Yes when his holy state is touchd so near
State holy or unhallowd what of that
Is not his grace protector to the king
RICHARD
Aside  Plantagenet I see must hold his tongue
Lest it be said Speak sirrah when you should
Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords
Else would I have a fling at Winchester
Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester
The special watchmen of our English weal
I would prevail if prayers might prevail
To join your hearts in love and amity
O what a scandal is it to our crown
That two such noble peers as ye should jar
Believe me lords my tender years can tell
Civil dissension is a viperous worm
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
A noise within Down with the tawnycoats
What tumults this
An uproar I dare warrant
Begun through malice of the bishops men
A noise again Stones stones Enter Mayor
O my good lords and virtuous Henry
Pity the city of London pity us
The bishop and the Duke of Gloucesters men
Forbidden late to carry any weapon
Have filld their pockets full of pebble stones
And banding themselves in contrary parts
Do pelt so fast at one anothers pate
That many have their giddy brains knockd out
Our windows are broke down in every street
And we for fear compelld to shut our shops
Enter Servingmen in skirmish with bloody pates
We charge you on allegiance to ourself
To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace
Pray uncle Gloucester mitigate this strife
First ServingmanNay if we be forbidden stones
Well fall to it with our teeth
Second ServingmanDo what ye dare we are as resolute
Skirmish again
You of my household leave this peevish broil
And set this unaccustomd fight aside
Third ServingmanMy lord we know your grace to be a man
Just and upright and for your royal birth
Inferior to none but to his majesty
And ere that we will suffer such a prince
So kind a father of the commonweal
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
We and our wives and children all will fight
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes
First ServingmanAy and the very parings of our nails
Shall pitch a field when we are dead
Begin again
Stay stay I say
And if you love me as you say you do
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile
O how this discord doth afflict my soul
Can you my Lord of Winchester behold
My sighs and tears and will not once relent
Who should be pitiful if you be not
Or who should study to prefer a peace
If holy churchmen take delight in broils
Yield my lord protector yield Winchester
Except you mean with obstinate repulse
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
You see what mischief and what murder too
Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
BISHOP
He shall submit or I will never yield
Compassion on the king commands me stoop
Or I would see his heart out ere the priest
Should ever get that privilege of me
Behold my Lord of Winchester the duke
Hath banishd moody discontented fury
As by his smoothed brows it doth appear
Why look you still so stern and tragical
Here Winchester I offer thee my hand
Fie uncle Beaufort I have heard you preach
That malice was a great and grievous sin
And will not you maintain the thing you teach
But prove a chief offender in the same
Sweet king the bishop hath a kindly gird
For shame my lord of Winchester relent
What shall a child instruct you what to do
BISHOP
Well Duke of Gloucester I will yield to thee
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give
Aside  Ay but I fear me with a hollow heart
See here my friends and loving countrymen
This token serveth for a flag of truce
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers
So help me God as I dissemble not
BISHOP
Aside  So help me God as I intend it not
O loving uncle kind Duke of Gloucester
Away my masters trouble us no more
But join in friendship as your lords have done
First ServingmanContent Ill to the surgeons
Second ServingmanAnd so will I
Third ServingmanAnd I will see what physic the tavern affords
Exeunt Servingmen Mayor  and c
Accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
We do exhibit to your majesty
Well urged my Lord of Warwick or sweet prince
And if your grace mark every circumstance
You have great reason to do Richard right
Especially for those occasions
At Eltham Place I told your majesty
And those occasions uncle were of force
Therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
That Richard be restored to his blood
Let Richard be restored to his blood
So shall his fathers wrongs be recompensed
BISHOP
As will the rest so willeth Winchester
If Richard will be true not that alone
But all the whole inheritance I give
That doth belong unto the house of York
From whence you spring by lineal descent
RICHARD
Thy humble servant vows obedience
And humble service till the point of death
Stoop then and set your knee against my foot
And in reguerdon of that duty done
I gird thee with the valiant sword of York
Rise Richard like a true Plantagenet
And rise created princely Duke of York
RICHARD
And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall
And as my duty springs so perish they
That grudge one thought against your majesty
Welcome high prince the mighty Duke of York
Aside  Perish base prince ignoble Duke of York
Now will it best avail your majesty
To cross the seas and to be crownd in France
The presence of a king engenders love
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
As it disanimates his enemies
When Gloucester says the word King Henry goes
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes
Your ships already are in readiness
Sennet Flourish Exeunt all but EXETER
Ay we may march in England or in France
Not seeing what is likely to ensue
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
And will at last break out into a flame
As festerd members rot but by degree
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
So will this base and envious discord breed
And now I fear that fatal prophecy
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
And Henry born at Windsor lose all
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
His days may finish ere that hapless time
Exit
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised with four Soldiers with sacks upon their backs
These are the city gates the gates of Rouen
Through which our policy must make a breach
Take heed be wary how you place your words
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
That come to gather money for their corn
If we have entrance as I hope we shall
And that we find the slothful watch but weak
Ill by a sign give notice to our friends
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen
Therefore well knock
Knocks
Within  Qui est la
Paysans pauvres gens de France
Poor market folks that come to sell their corn
Enter go in the market bell is rung
Now Rouen Ill shake thy bulwarks to the ground
Exeunt
Enter CHARLES the BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON REIGNIER and forces
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem
And once again well sleep secure in Rouen
Now she is there how will she specify
Where is the best and safest passage in
By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower
Which once discernd shows that her meaning is
No way to that for weakness which she enterd
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top thrusting out a torch burning
Behold this is the happy wedding torch
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen
But burning fatal to the Talbotites
Exit
See noble Charles the beacon of our friend
The burning torch in yonder turret stands
Now shine it like a comet of revenge
A prophet to the fall of all our foes
Defer no time delays have dangerous ends
Enter and cry The Dauphin presently
And then do execution on the watch
Alarum Exeunt
An alarum Enter TALBOT in an excursion
France thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears
If Talbot but survive thy treachery
Pucelle that witch that damned sorceress
Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares
That hardly we escaped the pride of France
Exit
An alarum excursions BEDFORD brought in sick  in a chair Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without  within JOAN LA PUCELLE CHARLES BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON and REIGNIER on the walls
Good morrow gallants want ye corn for bread
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
Before hell buy again at such a rate
Twas full of darnel do you like the taste
Scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn
Your grace may starve perhaps before that time
O let no words but deeds revenge this treason
What will you do good greybeard break a lance
And run a tilt at death within a chair
Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite
Encompassd with thy lustful paramours
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
And twit with cowardice a man half dead
Damsel Ill have a bout with you again
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame
Are ye so hot sir yet Pucelle hold thy peace
If Talbot do but thunder rain will follow
The English whisper together in council
God speed the parliament who shall be the speaker
Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field
Belike your lordship takes us then for fools
To try if that our own be ours or no
I speak not to that railing Hecate
But unto thee Alencon and the rest
Will ye like soldiers come and fight it out
Signior no
Signior hang base muleters of France
Like peasant footboys do they keep the walls
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen
Away captains lets get us from the walls
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks
God be wi you my lord we came but to tell you
That we are here
Exeunt from the walls
And there will we be too ere it be long
Or else reproach be Talbots greatest fame
Vow Burgundy by honour of thy house
Prickd on by public wrongs sustaind in France
Either to get the town again or die
And I as sure as English Henry lives
And as his father here was conqueror
As sure as in this latebetrayed town
Great Coeurdelions heart was buried
So sure I swear to get the town or die
My vows are equal partners with thy vows
But ere we go regard this dying prince
The valiant Duke of Bedford Come my lord
We will bestow you in some better place
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age
Lord Talbot do not so dishonour me
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
And will be partner of your weal or woe
Courageous Bedford let us now persuade you
Not to be gone from hence for once I read
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
Came to the field and vanquished his foes
Methinks I should revive the soldiers hearts
Because I ever found them as myself
Undaunted spirit in a dying breast
Then be it so heavens keep old Bedford safe
And now no more ado brave Burgundy
But gather we our forces out of hand
And set upon our boasting enemy
Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants
An alarum excursions Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain
Whither away Sir John Fastolfe in such haste
Whither away to save myself by flight
We are like to have the overthrow again
What will you fly and leave Lord Talbot
Ay
All the Talbots in the world to save my life
Exit
Cowardly knight ill fortune follow thee
Exit
Retreat excursions JOAN LA PUCELLE ALENCON and CHARLES fly
Now quiet soul depart when heaven please
For I have seen our enemies overthrow
What is the trust or strength of foolish man
They that of late were daring with their scoffs
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves
BEDFORD dies and is carried in by two in his chair
An alarum Reenter TALBOT BURGUNDY and the rest
Lost and recoverd in a day again
This is a double honour Burgundy
Yet heavens have glory for this victory
Warlike and martial Talbot Burgundy
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
Thy noble deeds as valours monuments
Thanks gentle duke But where is Pucelle now
I think her old familiar is asleep
Now wheres the Bastards braves and Charles his gleeks
What all amort Rouen hangs her head for grief
That such a valiant company are fled
Now will we take some order in the town
Placing therein some expert officers
And then depart to Paris to the king
For there young Henry with his nobles lie
What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy
But yet before we go lets not forget
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased
But see his exequies fulfilld in Rouen
A braver soldier never couched lance
A gentler heart did never sway in court
But kings and mightiest potentates must die
For thats the end of human misery
Exeunt
Enter CHARLES the BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON JOAN LA PUCELLE and forces
Dismay not princes at this accident
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered
Care is no cure but rather corrosive
For things that are not to be remedied
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
And like a peacock sweep along his tail
Well pull his plumes and take away his train
If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled
We have been guided by thee hitherto
And of thy cunning had no diffidence
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust
Search out thy wit for secret policies
And we will make thee famous through the world
Well set thy statue in some holy place
And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint
Employ thee then sweet virgin for our good
Then thus it must be this doth Joan devise
By fair persuasions mixd with sugard words
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
To leave the Talbot and to follow us
Ay marry sweeting if we could do that
France were no place for Henrys warriors
Nor should that nation boast it so with us
But be extirped from our provinces
For ever should they be expulsed from France
And not have title of an earldom here
Your honours shall perceive how I will work
To bring this matter to the wished end
Drum sounds afar off
Hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
Their powers are marching unto Parisward
Here sound an English march Enter and pass over at a distance TALBOT and his forces
There goes the Talbot with his colours spread
And all the troops of English after him
French march Enter BURGUNDY and forces
Now in the rearward comes the duke and his
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind
Summon a parley we will talk with him
Trumpets sound a parley
A parley with the Duke of Burgundy
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy
The princely Charles of France thy countryman
What sayst thou Charles for I am marching hence
Speak Pucelle and enchant him with thy words
Brave Burgundy undoubted hope of France
Stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee
Speak on but be not overtedious
Look on thy country look on fertile France
And see the cities and the towns defaced
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe
As looks the mother on her lowly babe
When death doth close his tender dying eyes
See see the pining malady of France
Behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast
O turn thy edged sword another way
Strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
One drop of blood drawn from thy countrys bosom
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears
And wash away thy countrys stained spots
Either she hath bewitchd me with her words
Or nature makes me suddenly relent
Besides all French and France exclaims on thee
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
Who jointst thou with but with a lordly nation
That will not trust thee but for profits sake
When Talbot hath set footing once in France
And fashiond thee that instrument of ill
Who then but English Henry will be lord
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive
Call we to mind and mark but this for proof
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe
And was he not in England prisoner
But when they heard he was thine enemy
They set him free without his ransom paid
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends
See then thou fightst against thy countrymen
And jointst with them will be thy slaughtermen
Come come return return thou wandering lord
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms
I am vanquished these haughty words of hers
Have batterd me like roaring cannonshot
And made me almost yield upon my knees
Forgive me country and sweet countrymen
And lords accept this hearty kind embrace
My forces and my power of men are yours
So farewell Talbot Ill no longer trust thee
Aside  Done like a Frenchman turn and turn again
Welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh
And doth beget new courage in our breasts
Pucelle hath bravely playd her part in this
And doth deserve a coronet of gold
Now let us on my lords and join our powers
And seek how we may prejudice the foe

My gracious prince and honourable peers
Hearing of your arrival in this realm

To do my duty to my sovereign
In sign whereof this arm that hath reclaimd
To your obedience fifty fortresses
Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem
Lets fall his sword before your highness feet
And with submissive loyalty of heart
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
First to my God and next unto your grace
Kneels
Is this the Lord Talbot uncle Gloucester
That hath so long been resident in France
Yes if it please your majesty my liege
Welcome brave captain and victorious lord
When I was young as yet I am not old
I do remember how my father said
A stouter champion never handled sword
Long since we were resolved of your truth
Your faithful service and your toil in war
Yet never have you tasted our reward
Or been reguerdond with so much as thanks
Because till now we never saw your face
Therefore stand up and for these good deserts
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury
And in our coronation take your place
Sennet Flourish Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET
Now sir to you that were so hot at sea
Disgracing of these colours that I wear
In honour of my noble Lord of York
Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest
Yes sir as well as you dare patronage
The envious barking of your saucy tongue
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset
Sirrah thy lord I honour as he is
Why what is he as good a man as York
Hark ye not so in witness take ye that
Strikes him
Villain thou knowst the law of arms is such
That whoso draws a sword tis present death
Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood
But Ill unto his majesty and crave
I may have liberty to venge this wrong
When thou shalt see Ill meet thee to thy cost
Well miscreant Ill be there as soon as you
And after meet you sooner than you would

This shall ye do so help you righteous God
Enter FASTOLFE
My gracious sovereign as I rode from Calais
To haste unto your coronation
A letter was deliverd to my hands
Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy
Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee
I vowd base knight when I did meet thee next
To tear the garter from thy cravens leg
Plucking it off
Which I have done because unworthily
Thou wast installed in that high degree
Pardon me princely Henry and the rest
This dastard at the battle of Patay
When but in all I was six thousand strong
And that the French were almost ten to one
Before we met or that a stroke was given
Like to a trusty squire did run away
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men
Myself and divers gentlemen beside
Were there surprised and taken prisoners
Then judge great lords if I have done amiss
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
This ornament of knighthood yea or no
And ill beseeming any common man
Much more a knight a captain and a leader
When first this order was ordaind my lords
Knights of the garter were of noble birth
Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
Such as were grown to credit by the wars
Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
But always resolute in most extremes
He then that is not furnishd in this sort
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
Profaning this most honourable order
And should if I were worthy to be judge
Be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood
Stain to thy countrymen thou hearst thy doom
Be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
Exit FASTOLFE
And now my lord protector view the letter
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy
What means his grace that he hath changed his style
No more but plain and bluntly To the king
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign
Or doth this churlish superscription
Pretend some alteration in good will
Whats here
Reads
I have upon especial cause
Moved with compassion of my countrys wreck
Together with the pitiful complaints
Of such as your oppression feeds upon
And joind with Charles the rightful King of France
O monstrous treachery can this be so
That in alliance amity and oaths
There should be found such false dissembling guile
What doth my uncle Burgundy revolt
He doth my lord and is become your foe
Is that the worst this letter doth contain
It is the worst and all my lord he writes
Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with him
And give him chastisement for this abuse
How say you my lord are you not content
Content my liege yes but that I am prevented
I should have beggd I might have been employd
Then gather strength and march unto him straight
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
And what offence it is to flout his friends
I go my lord in heart desiring still
You may behold confusion of your foes
Exit
Enter VERNON and BASSET
Grant me the combat gracious sovereign
And me my lord grant me the combat too
This is my servant hear him noble prince
And this is mine sweet Henry favour him
Be patient lords and give them leave to speak
Say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim
And wherefore crave you combat or with whom
With him my lord for he hath done me wrong
And I with him for he hath done me wrong
What is that wrong whereof you both complain
First let me know and then Ill answer you
Crossing the sea from England into France
This fellow here with envious carping tongue
Upbraided me about the rose I wear
Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
Did represent my masters blushing cheeks
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
About a certain question in the law
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him
With other vile and ignominious terms
In confutation of which rude reproach
And in defence of my lords worthiness
I crave the benefit of law of arms
And that is my petition noble lord
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
To set a gloss upon his bold intent
Yet know my lord I was provoked by him
And he first took exceptions at this badge
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
Bewrayd the faintness of my masters heart
Will not this malice Somerset be left
Your private grudge my Lord of York will out
Though neer so cunningly you smother it
Good Lord what madness rules in brainsick men
When for so slight and frivolous a cause
Good cousins both of York and Somerset
Quiet yourselves I pray and be at peace
Let this dissension first be tried by fight
And then your highness shall command a peace
The quarrel toucheth none but us alone
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
There is my pledge accept it Somerset
Nay let it rest where it began at first
Confirm it so mine honourable lord
Confirm it so Confounded be your strife
And perish ye with your audacious prate
Presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed
With this immodest clamorous outrage
To trouble and disturb the king and us
And you my lords methinks you do not well
To bear with their perverse objections
Much less to take occasion from their mouths
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
Let me persuade you take a better course
It grieves his highness good my lords be friends
Come hither you that would be combatants
Henceforth I charge you as you love our favour
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
And you my lords remember where we are
In France amongst a fickle wavering nation
If they perceive dissension in our looks
And that within ourselves we disagree
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
To wilful disobedience and rebel
Beside what infamy will there arise
When foreign princes shall be certified
That for a toy a thing of no regard
King Henrys peers and chief nobility
Destroyd themselves and lost the realm of France
O think upon the conquest of my father
My tender years and let us not forego
That for a trifle that was bought with blood
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
I see no reason if I wear this rose
Putting on a red rose
That any one should therefore be suspicious
I more incline to Somerset than York
Both are my kinsmen and I love them both
As well they may upbraid me with my crown
Because forsooth the king of Scots is crownd
But your discretions better can persuade
Than I am able to instruct or teach
And therefore as we hither came in peace
So let us still continue peace and love
Cousin of York we institute your grace
To be our regent in these parts of France
And good my Lord of Somerset unite
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
And like true subjects sons of your progenitors
Go cheerfully together and digest
Your angry choler on your enemies
Ourself my lord protector and the rest
After some respite will return to Calais
From thence to England where I hope ere long
To be presented by your victories
With Charles Alencon and that traitorous rout
Flourish Exeunt all but YORK WARWICK EXETER and VERNON
My Lord of York I promise you the king
Prettily methought did play the orator
And so he did but yet I like it not
In that he wears the badge of Somerset
Tush that was but his fancy blame him not
I dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm
An if I wist he didbut let it rest
Other affairs must now be managed
Exeunt all but EXETER
Well didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice
For had the passions of thy heart burst out
I fear we should have seen decipherd there
More rancorous spite more furious raging broils
Than yet can be imagined or supposed
But howsoeer no simple man that sees
This jarring discord of nobility
This shouldering of each other in the court
But that it doth presage some ill event
Tis much when sceptres are in childrens hands
But more when envy breeds unkind division
There comes the rain there begins confusion
Exit
Enter TALBOT with trump and drum
Go to the gates of Bourdeaux trumpeter
Summon their general unto the wall
Trumpet sounds Enter General and others aloft
English John Talbot captains calls you forth
Servant in arms to Harry King of England
And thus he would Open your city gates
Be humble to us call my sovereign yours
And do him homage as obedient subjects
And Ill withdraw me and my bloody power
But if you frown upon this profferd peace
You tempt the fury of my three attendants
Lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire
Who in a moment even with the earth
Shall lay your stately and airbraving towers
If you forsake the offer of their love
Thou ominous and fearful owl of death
Our nations terror and their bloody scourge
The period of thy tyranny approacheth
On us thou canst not enter but by death
For I protest we are well fortified
And strong enough to issue out and fight
If thou retire the Dauphin well appointed
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitchd
To wall thee from the liberty of flight
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
And pale destruction meets thee in the face
Ten thousand French have taen the sacrament
To rive their dangerous artillery
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot
Lo there thou standst a breathing valiant man
Of an invincible unconquerd spirit
This is the latest glory of thy praise
That I thy enemy due thee withal
For ere the glass that now begins to run
Finish the process of his sandy hour
These eyes that see thee now well coloured
Shall see thee witherd bloody pale and dead
Drum afar off
Hark hark the Dauphins drum a warning bell
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out
Exeunt General  and c
He fables not I hear the enemy
Out some light horsemen and peruse their wings
O negligent and heedless discipline
How are we parkd and bounded in a pale
A little herd of Englands timorous deer
Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs
If we be English deer be then in blood
Not rascallike to fall down with a pinch
But rather moodymad and desperate stags
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay
Sell every man his life as dear as mine
And they shall find dear deer of us my friends
God and Saint George Talbot and Englands right
Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight
Exeunt
Enter a Messenger that meets YORK Enter YORK with trumpet and many Soldiers
Are not the speedy scouts returnd again
That doggd the mighty army of the Dauphin
They are returnd my lord and give it out
That he is marchd to Bourdeaux with his power
To fight with Talbot as he marchd along
By your espials were discovered
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led
Which joind with him and made their march for Bourdeaux
A plague upon that villain Somerset
That thus delays my promised supply
Of horsemen that were levied for this siege
Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid
And I am lowted by a traitor villain
And cannot help the noble chevalier
God comfort him in this necessity
If he miscarry farewell wars in France
Enter Sir William LUCY
Thou princely leader of our English strength
Never so needful on the earth of France
Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot
Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
And hemmd about with grim destruction
To Bourdeaux warlike duke to Bourdeaux York
Else farewell Talbot France and Englands honour
O God that Somerset who in proud heart
Doth stop my cornets were in Talbots place
So should we save a valiant gentleman
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep
That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep
O send some succor to the distressd lord
He dies we lose I break my warlike word
We mourn France smiles we lose they daily get
All long of this vile traitor Somerset
Then God take mercy on brave Talbots soul
And on his son young John who two hours since
I met in travel toward his warlike father
This seven years did not Talbot see his son
And now they meet where both their lives are done
Alas what joy shall noble Talbot have
To bid his young son welcome to his grave
Away vexation almost stops my breath
That sunderd friends greet in the hour of death
Lucy farewell no more my fortune can
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man
Maine Blois Poictiers and Tours are won away
Long all of Somerset and his delay
Exit with his soldiers
Thus while the vulture of sedition
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders
Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror
That ever living man of memory
Henry the Fifth whiles they each other cross
Lives honours lands and all hurry to loss
Exit
Enter SOMERSET with his army a Captain of TALBOTs with him
It is too late I cannot send them now
This expedition was by York and Talbot
Too rashly plotted all our general force
Might with a sally of the very town
Be buckled with the overdaring Talbot
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
By this unheedful desperate wild adventure
York set him on to fight and die in shame
That Talbot dead great York might bear the name
Here is Sir William Lucy who with me
Set from our oermatchd forces forth for aid
Enter Sir William LUCY
How now Sir William whither were you sent
Whither my lord from bought and sold Lord Talbot
Who ringd about with bold adversity
Cries out for noble York and Somerset
To beat assailing death from his weak legions
And whiles the honourable captain there
Drops bloody sweat from his warwearied limbs
And in advantage lingering looks for rescue
You his false hopes the trust of Englands honour
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation
Let not your private discord keep away
The levied succors that should lend him aid
While he renowned noble gentleman
Yields up his life unto a world of odds
Orleans the Bastard Charles Burgundy
Alencon Reignier compass him about
And Talbot perisheth by your default
York set him on York should have sent him aid
And York as fast upon your grace exclaims
Swearing that you withhold his levied host
Collected for this expedition
York lies he might have sent and had the horse
I owe him little duty and less love
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending
The fraud of England not the force of France
Hath now entrappd the nobleminded Talbot
Never to England shall he bear his life
But dies betrayd to fortune by your strife
Come go I will dispatch the horsemen straight
Within six hours they will be at his aid
Too late comes rescue he is taen or slain
For fly he could not if he would have fled
And fly would Talbot never though he might
If he be dead brave Talbot then adieu
His fame lives in the world his shame in you
Exeunt
Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son
O young John Talbot I did send for thee
To tutor thee in stratagems of war
That Talbots name might be in thee revived
When sapless age and weak unable limbs
Should bring thy father to his drooping chair
But O malignant and illboding stars
Now thou art come unto a feast of death
A terrible and unavoided danger
Therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
And Ill direct thee how thou shalt escape
By sudden flight come dally not be gone
Is my name Talbot and am I your son
And shall I fly O if you love my mother
Dishonour not her honourable name
To make a bastard and a slave of me
The world will say he is not Talbots blood
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood
Fly to revenge my death if I be slain
He that flies so will neer return again
If we both stay we both are sure to die
Then let me stay and father do you fly
Your loss is great so your regard should be
My worth unknown no loss is known in me
Upon my death the French can little boast
In yours they will in you all hopes are lost
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won
But mine it will that no exploit have done
You fled for vantage everyone will swear
But if I bow theyll say it was for fear
There is no hope that ever I will stay
If the first hour I shrink and run away
Here on my knee I beg mortality
Rather than life preserved with infamy
Shall all thy mothers hopes lie in one tomb
Ay rather than Ill shame my mothers womb
Upon my blessing I command thee go
To fight I will but not to fly the foe
Part of thy father may be saved in thee
No part of him but will be shame in me
Thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it
Yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it
Thy fathers charge shall clear thee from that stain
You cannot witness for me being slain
If death be so apparent then both fly
And leave my followers here to fight and die
My age was never tainted with such shame
And shall my youth be guilty of such blame
No more can I be severd from your side
Than can yourself yourself in twain divide
Stay go do what you will the like do I
For live I will not if my father die
Then here I take my leave of thee fair son
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon
Come side by side together live and die
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly
Exeunt
Alarum excursions wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemmed about and TALBOT rescues him
Saint George and victory fight soldiers fight
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word
And left us to the rage of France his sword
Where is John Talbot Pause and take thy breath
I gave thee life and rescued thee from death
O twice my father twice am I thy son
The life thou gavest me first was lost and done
Till with thy warlike sword despite of late
To my determined time thou gavest new date
When from the Dauphins crest thy sword struck fire
It warmd thy fathers heart with proud desire
Of boldfaced victory Then leaden age
Quickend with youthful spleen and warlike rage
Beat down Alencon Orleans Burgundy
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee
The ireful bastard Orleans that drew blood
From thee my boy and had the maidenhood
Of thy first fight I soon encountered
And interchanging blows I quickly shed
Some of his bastard blood and in disgrace
Bespoke him thus Contaminated base
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine
Mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine
Which thou didst force from Talbot my brave boy
Here purposing the Bastard to destroy
Came in strong rescue Speak thy fathers care
Art thou not weary John how dost thou fare
Wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly
Now thou art seald the son of chivalry
Fly to revenge my death when I am dead
The help of one stands me in little stead
O too much folly is it well I wot
To hazard all our lives in one small boat
If I today die not with Frenchmens rage
Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age
By me they nothing gain an if I stay
Tis but the shortening of my life one day
In thee thy mother dies our households name
My deaths revenge thy youth and Englands fame
All these and more we hazard by thy stay
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away
The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart
These words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart
On that advantage bought with such a shame
To save a paltry life and slay bright fame
Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly
The coward horse that bears me fail and die
And like me to the peasant boys of France
To be shames scorn and subject of mischance
Surely by all the glory you have won
An if I fly I am not Talbots son
Then talk no more of flight it is no boot
If son to Talbot die at Talbots foot
Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete
Thou Icarus thy life to me is sweet
If thou wilt fight fight by thy fathers side
And commendable proved lets die in pride
Exeunt
Alarum excursions Enter TALBOT led by a Servant
Where is my other life mine own is gone
O wheres young Talbot where is valiant John
Triumphant death smeard with captivity
Young Talbots valour makes me smile at thee
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee
His bloody sword he brandishd over me
And like a hungry lion did commence
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience
But when my angry guardant stood alone
Tendering my ruin and assaild of none
Dizzyeyed fury and great rage of heart
Suddenly made him from my side to start
Into the clustering battle of the French
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
His overmounting spirit and there died
My Icarus my blossom in his pride
O my dear lord lo where your son is borne
Enter Soldiers with the body of JOHN TALBOT
Thou antic death which laughst us here to scorn
Anon from thy insulting tyranny
Coupled in bonds of perpetuity
Two Talbots winged through the lither sky
In thy despite shall scape mortality
O thou whose wounds become hardfavourd death
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath
Brave death by speaking whether he will or no
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe
Poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say
Had death been French then death had died today
Come come and lay him in his fathers arms
My spirit can no longer bear these harms
Soldiers adieu I have what I would have
Now my old arms are young John Talbots grave
Dies
Enter CHARLES ALENCON BURGUNDY BASTARD OF ORLEANS JOAN LA PUCELLE and forces
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in
We should have found a bloody day of this
How the young whelp of Talbots ragingwood
Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmens blood
Once I encounterd him and thus I said
Thou maiden youth be vanquishd by a maid
But with a proud majestical high scorn
He answerd thus Young Talbot was not born
To be the pillage of a giglot wench
So rushing in the bowels of the French
He left me proudly as unworthy fight
Doubtless he would have made a noble knight
See where he lies inhearsed in the arms
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms
Hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder
Whose life was Englands glory Gallias wonder
O no forbear for that which we have fled
During the life let us not wrong it dead
Enter Sir William LUCY attended Herald of the French preceding
Herald conduct me to the Dauphins tent
To know who hath obtained the glory of the day
On what submissive message art thou sent
Submission Dauphin tis a mere French word
We English warriors wot not what it means
I come to know what prisoners thou hast taen
And to survey the bodies of the dead
For prisoners askst thou hell our prison is
But tell me whom thou seekst
But wheres the great Alcides of the field
Valiant Lord Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury
Created for his rare success in arms
Great Earl of Washford Waterford and Valence
Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield
Lord Strange of Blackmere Lord Verdun of Alton
Lord Cromwell of Wingfield Lord Furnival of Sheffield
The thricevictorious Lord of Falconbridge
Knight of the noble order of Saint George
Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece
Great marshal to Henry the Sixth
Of all his wars within the realm of France
Here is a silly stately style indeed
The Turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath
Writes not so tedious a style as this
Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
Stinking and flyblown lies here at our feet
Is Talbot slain the Frenchmens only scourge
Your kingdoms terror and black Nemesis
O were mine eyeballs into bullets turnd
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces
O that I could but call these dead to life
It were enough to fright the realm of France
Were but his picture left amongst you here
It would amaze the proudest of you all
Give me their bodies that I may bear them hence
And give them burial as beseems their worth
I think this upstart is old Talbots ghost
He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
For Gods sake let him have em to keep them here
They would but stink and putrefy the air
Go take their bodies hence
Ill bear them hence but from their ashes shall be reard
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard
So we be rid of them do with em what thou wilt
And now to Paris in this conquering vein
All will be ours now bloody Talbots slain

How doth your grace affect their motion
Well my good lord and as the only means
To stop effusion of our Christian blood
And stablish quietness on every side
Ay marry uncle for I always thought
It was both impious and unnatural
That such immanity and bloody strife
Should reign among professors of one faith
Beside my lord the sooner to effect
And surer bind this knot of amity
The Earl of Armagnac near knit to Charles
A man of great authority in France
Proffers his only daughter to your grace
In marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry
Marriage uncle alas my years are young

My lords ambassadors your several suits
Have been considerd and debated on
And therefore are we certainly resolved
To draw conditions of a friendly peace
Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
Shall be transported presently to France
And for the proffer of my lord your master

Appear and aid me in this enterprise
Enter Fiends
This speedy and quick appearance argues proof
Of your accustomd diligence to me
Now ye familiar spirits that are culld
Out of the powerful regions under earth
Help me this once that France may get the field
They walk and speak not
O hold me not with silence overlong
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood
Ill lop a member off and give it you
In earnest of further benefit
So you do condescend to help me now
They hang their heads
No hope to have redress My body shall
Pay recompense if you will grant my suit
They shake their heads
Cannot my body nor bloodsacrifice
Entreat you to your wonted furtherance
Then take my soul my body soul and all
Before that England give the French the foil
They depart
See they forsake me Now the time is come
That France must vail her loftyplumed crest
And let her head fall into Englands lap
My ancient incantations are too weak
And hell too strong for me to buckle with
Now France thy glory droopeth to the dust
Exit
Excursions Reenter JOAN LA PUCELLE fighting hand  to hand with YORK JOAN LA PUCELLE is taken The French fly
Damsel of France I think I have you fast
Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
And try if they can gain your liberty
A goodly prize fit for the devils grace
See how the ugly wench doth bend her brows
As if with Circe she would change my shape
Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be
O Charles the Dauphin is a proper man
No shape but his can please your dainty eye
A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee
And may ye both be suddenly surprised
By bloody hands in sleeping on your beds
Fell banning hag enchantress hold thy tongue
I prithee give me leave to curse awhile
Curse miscreant when thou comest to the stake
Exeunt
Alarum Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand
Be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner
Gazes on her
O fairest beauty do not fear nor fly
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace
And lay them gently on thy tender side
Who art thou say that I may honour thee
Margaret my name and daughter to a king
The King of Naples whosoeer thou art
An earl I am and Suffolk am I calld
Be not offended natures miracle
Thou art allotted to be taen by me
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save
Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings
Yet if this servile usage once offend
Go and be free again as Suffolks friend
She is going
O stay I have no power to let her pass
My hand would free her but my heart says no
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams
Twinkling another counterfeited beam
So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
Fain would I woo her yet I dare not speak
Ill call for pen and ink and write my mind
Fie de la Pole disable not thyself
Hast not a tongue is she not here
Wilt thou be daunted at a womans sight
Ay beautys princely majesty is such
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
Say Earl of Suffolkif thy name be so
What ransom must I pay before I pass
For I perceive I am thy prisoner
How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
Before thou make a trial of her love
Why speakst thou not what ransom must I pay
Shes beautiful and therefore to be wood
She is a woman therefore to be won
Wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no
Fond man remember that thou hast a wife
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour
I were best to leave him for he will not hear
There all is marrd there lies a cooling card
He talks at random sure the man is mad
And yet a dispensation may be had
And yet I would that you would answer me
Ill win this Lady Margaret For whom
Why for my king tush thats a wooden thing
He talks of wood it is some carpenter
Yet so my fancy may be satisfied
And peace established between these realms
But there remains a scruple in that too
For though her father be the King of Naples
Duke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poor
And our nobility will scorn the match
Hear ye captain are you not at leisure
It shall be so disdain they neer so much
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield
Madam I have a secret to reveal
What though I be enthralld he seems a knight
And will not any way dishonour me
Lady vouchsafe to listen what I say
Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French
And then I need not crave his courtesy
Sweet madam give me a hearing in a cause
Tush women have been captivate ere now
Lady wherefore talk you so
I cry you mercy tis but Quid for Quo
Say gentle princess would you not suppose
Your bondage happy to be made a queen
To be a queen in bondage is more vile
Than is a slave in base servility
For princes should be free
And so shall you
If happy Englands royal king be free
Why what concerns his freedom unto me
Ill undertake to make thee Henrys queen
To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
And set a precious crown upon thy head
If thou wilt condescend to be my
What
His love
I am unworthy to be Henrys wife
No gentle madam I unworthy am
To woo so fair a dame to be his wife
And have no portion in the choice myself
How say you madam are ye so content
An if my father please I am content
Then call our captains and our colours forth
And madam at your fathers castle walls
Well crave a parley to confer with him
A parley sounded Enter REIGNIER on the walls
See Reignier see thy daughter prisoner
To whom
To me
Suffolk what remedy
I am a soldier and unapt to weep
Or to exclaim on fortunes fickleness
Yes there is remedy enough my lord
Consent and for thy honour give consent
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king
Whom I with pain have wood and won thereto
And this her easyheld imprisonment
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty
Speaks Suffolk as he thinks
Fair Margaret knows
That Suffolk doth not flatter face or feign
Upon thy princely warrant I descend
To give thee answer of thy just demand
Exit from the walls
And here I will expect thy coming
Trumpets sound Enter REIGNIER below
Welcome brave earl into our territories
Command in Anjou what your honour pleases
Thanks Reignier happy for so sweet a child
Fit to be made companion with a king
What answer makes your grace unto my suit
Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
To be the princely bride of such a lord
Upon condition I may quietly
Enjoy mine own the country Maine and Anjou
Free from oppression or the stroke of war
My daughter shall be Henrys if he please
That is her ransom I deliver her
And those two counties I will undertake
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy
And I again in Henrys royal name
As deputy unto that gracious king
Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith
Reignier of France I give thee kingly thanks
Because this is in traffic of a king
Aside
And yet methinks I could be well content
To be mine own attorney in this case
Ill over then to England with this news
And make this marriage to be solemnized
So farewell Reignier set this diamond safe
In golden palaces as it becomes
I do embrace thee as I would embrace
The Christian prince King Henry were he here
Farewell my lord good wishes praise and prayers
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret
Going
Farewell sweet madam but hark you Margaret
No princely commendations to my king
Such commendations as becomes a maid
A virgin and his servant say to him
Words sweetly placed and modestly directed
But madam I must trouble you again
No loving token to his majesty
Yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart
Never yet taint with love I send the king
And this withal
Kisses her
That for thyself I will not so presume
To send such peevish tokens to a king
Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
O wert thou for myself But Suffolk stay
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
And natural graces that extinguish art
Repeat their semblance often on the seas
That when thou comest to kneel at Henrys feet
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder
Exit
Enter YORK WARWICK and others
Bring forth that sorceress condemnd to burn
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE guarded and a Shepherd
Ah Joan this kills thy fathers heart outright
Have I sought every country far and near
And now it is my chance to find thee out
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death
Ah Joan sweet daughter Joan Ill die with thee
Decrepit miser base ignoble wretch
I am descended of a gentler blood
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine
Out out My lords an please you tis not so
I did beget her all the parish knows
Her mother liveth yet can testify
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship
Graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage
This argues what her kind of life hath been
Wicked and vile and so her death concludes
Fie Joan that thou wilt be so obstacle
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear
Deny me not I prithee gentle Joan
Peasant avaunt You have subornd this man
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth
Tis true I gave a noble to the priest
The morn that I was wedded to her mother
Kneel down and take my blessing good my girl
Wilt thou not stoop Now cursed be the time
Of thy nativity I would the milk
Thy mother gave thee when thou suckdst her breast
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake
Or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
Dost thou deny thy father cursed drab
O burn her burn her hanging is too good
Exit
Take her away for she hath lived too long
To fill the world with vicious qualities
First let me tell you whom you have condemnd
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain
But issued from the progeny of kings
Virtuous and holy chosen from above
By inspiration of celestial grace
To work exceeding miracles on earth
I never had to do with wicked spirits
But you that are polluted with your lusts
Staind with the guiltless blood of innocents
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
Because you want the grace that others have
You judge it straight a thing impossible
To compass wonders but by help of devils
No misconceived Joan of Arc hath been
A virgin from her tender infancy
Chaste and immaculate in very thought
Whose maiden blood thus rigorously effused
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven
Ay ay away with her to execution
And hark ye sirs because she is a maid
Spare for no faggots let there be enow
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
That so her torture may be shortened
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
Then Joan discover thine infirmity
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege
I am with child ye bloody homicides
Murder not then the fruit within my womb
Although ye hale me to a violent death
Now heaven forfend the holy maid with child
The greatest miracle that eer ye wrought
Is all your strict preciseness come to this
She and the Dauphin have been juggling
I did imagine what would be her refuge
Well go to well have no bastards live
Especially since Charles must father it
You are deceived my child is none of his
It was Alencon that enjoyd my love
Alencon that notorious Machiavel
It dies an if it had a thousand lives
O give me leave I have deluded you
Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named
But Reignier king of Naples that prevaild
A married man thats most intolerable
Why heres a girl I think she knows not well
There were so many whom she may accuse
Its sign she hath been liberal and free
And yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
Strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
Use no entreaty for it is in vain
Then lead me hence with whom I leave my curse
May never glorious sun reflex his beams
Upon the country where you make abode
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
Environ you till mischief and despair
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
Exit guarded
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes
Thou foul accursed minister of hell
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER attended
CARDINAL
Lord regent I do greet your excellence
With letters of commission from the king
For know my lords the states of Christendom
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils
Have earnestly implored a general peace
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
Approacheth to confer about some matter
Is all our travail turnd to this effect
After the slaughter of so many peers
So many captains gentlemen and soldiers
That in this quarrel have been overthrown
And sold their bodies for their countrys benefit
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
Have we not lost most part of all the towns
By treason falsehood and by treachery
Our great progenitors had conquered
O Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief
The utter loss of all the realm of France
Be patient York if we conclude a peace
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby
Enter CHARLES ALENCON BASTARD OF ORLEANS REIGNIER and others
Since lords of England it is thus agreed
That peaceful truce shall be proclaimd in France
We come to be informed by yourselves
What the conditions of that league must be
Speak Winchester for boiling choler chokes
The hollow passage of my poisond voice
By sight of these our baleful enemies
CARDINAL
That in regard King Henry gives consent
Of mere compassion and of lenity
To ease your country of distressful war
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
You shall become true liegemen to his crown
And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear
To pay him tribute submit thyself
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him
And still enjoy thy regal dignity
Must he be then as shadow of himself
Adorn his temples with a coronet
And yet in substance and authority
Retain but privilege of a private man
This proffer is absurd and reasonless
Tis known already that I am possessd
With more than half the Gallian territories
And therein reverenced for their lawful king
Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquishd
As to be calld but viceroy of the whole
No lord ambassador Ill rather keep
That which I have than coveting for more
Be cast from possibility of all
Insulting Charles hast thou by secret means
Used intercession to obtain a league
And now the matter grows to compromise
Standst thou aloof upon comparison
Either accept the title thou usurpst
Of benefit proceeding from our king
And not of any challenge of desert
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars
My lord you do not well in obstinacy
If once it be neglected ten to one
We shall not find like opportunity
To say the truth it is your policy
To save your subjects from such massacre
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
By our proceeding in hostility
Although you break it when your pleasure serves
How sayst thou Charles shall our condition stand
It shall
Only reserved you claim no interest
In any of our towns of garrison
Then swear allegiance to his majesty
As thou art knight never to disobey
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England
Thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England
So now dismiss your army when ye please
Hang up your ensign let your drums be still
For here we entertain a solemn peace
Exeunt
Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER and EXETER
Your wondrous rare description noble earl
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonishd me
Her virtues graced with external gifts
Do breed loves settled passions in my heart
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
So am I driven by breath of her renown
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
Where I may have fruition of her love
Tush my good lord this superficial tale
Is but a preface of her worthy praise
The chief perfections of that lovely dame
Had I sufficient skill to utter them
Would make a volume of enticing lines
Able to ravish any dull conceit
And which is more she is not so divine
So fullreplete with choice of all delights
But with as humble lowliness of mind
She is content to be at your command
Command I mean of virtuous chaste intents
To love and honour Henry as her lord
And otherwise will Henry neer presume
Therefore my lord protector give consent
That Margaret may be Englands royal queen
So should I give consent to flatter sin
You know my lord your highness is betrothd
Unto another lady of esteem
And not deface your honour with reproach
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
Or one that at a triumph having vowd
To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
By reason of his adversarys odds
A poor earls daughter is unequal odds
And therefore may be broke without offence
Why what I pray is Margaret more than that
Her father is no better than an earl
Although in glorious titles he excel
Yes lord her father is a king
The King of Naples and Jerusalem
And of such great authority in France
As his alliance will confirm our peace
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles
Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give
A dower my lords disgrace not so your king
That he should be so abject base and poor
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love
Henry is able to enrich his queen
And not seek a queen to make him rich
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives
As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse
Marriage is a matter of more worth
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship
Not whom we will but whom his grace affects
Must be companion of his nuptial bed
And therefore lords since he affects her most
It most of all these reasons bindeth us
In our opinions she should be preferrd
For what is wedlock forced but a hell
An age of discord and continual strife
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
And is a pattern of celestial peace
Whom should we match with Henry being a king
But Margaret that is daughter to a king
Her peerless feature joined with her birth
Approves her fit for none but for a king
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
More than in women commonly is seen
Will answer our hope in issue of a king
For Henry son unto a conqueror
Is likely to beget more conquerors
If with a lady of so high resolve
As is fair Margaret he be linkd in love
Then yield my lords and here conclude with me
That Margaret shall be queen and none but she
Whether it be through force of your report
My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that
My tender youth was never yet attaint
With any passion of inflaming love
I cannot tell but this I am assured
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
As I am sick with working of my thoughts
Take therefore shipping post my lord to France
Agree to any covenants and procure
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
To cross the seas to England and be crownd
King Henrys faithful and anointed queen
For your expenses and sufficient charge
Among the people gather up a tenth
Be gone I say for till you do return
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares
And you good uncle banish all offence
If you do censure me by what you were
Not what you are I know it will excuse
This sudden execution of my will
And so conduct me where from company
I may revolve and ruminate my grief
Exit
Ay grief I fear me both at first and last
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
Thus Suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece
With hope to find the like event in love
But prosper better than the Trojan did
Margaret shall now be queen and rule the king
But I will rule both her the king and realm
Exit
Flourish of trumpets then hautboys Enter KING  HENRY VI GLOUCESTER SALISBURY WARWICK and  CARDINAL on the one side QUEEN MARGARET SUFFOLK YORK SOMERSET and BUCKINGHAM on the other
As by your high imperial majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France
As procurator to your excellence
To marry Princess Margaret for your grace
So in the famous ancient city Tours
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil
The Dukes of Orleans Calaber Bretagne and Alencon
Seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops
I have performd my task and was espoused
And humbly now upon my bended knee
In sight of England and her lordly peers
Deliver up my title in the queen
To your most gracious hands that are the substance
Of that great shadow I did represent
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave
The fairest queen that ever king received
Suffolk arise Welcome Queen Margaret
I can express no kinder sign of love
Than this kind kiss O Lord that lends me life
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
A world of earthly blessings to my soul
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts
Great King of England and my gracious lord
The mutual conference that my mind hath had
By day by night waking and in my dreams
In courtly company or at my beads
With you mine alderliefest sovereign
Makes me the bolder to salute my king
With ruder terms such as my wit affords
And overjoy of heart doth minister
Her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
Her words yclad with wisdoms majesty
Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys
Such is the fulness of my hearts content
Lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love
Kneeling  Long live Queen Margaret Englands

We thank you all
Flourish
My lord protector so it please your grace
Between our sovereign and the French king Charles
For eighteen months concluded by consent
Reads  Imprimis it is agreed between the French
king Charles and William de la Pole Marquess of
Suffolk ambassador for Henry King of England that

daughter unto Reignier King of Naples Sicilia and
Jerusalem and crown her Queen of England ere the
thirtieth of May next ensuing Item that the duchy
of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released
and delivered to the king her father
Lets the paper fall
Uncle how now
Pardon me gracious lord
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
And dimmd mine eyes that I can read no further
Uncle of Winchester I pray read on
Reads  Item It is further agreed between them
that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be
released and delivered over to the king her father
and she sent over of the King of Englands own
proper cost and charges without having any dowry
They please us well Lord marquess kneel down

Be full expired Thanks uncle Winchester
Gloucester York Buckingham Somerset
Salisbury and Warwick
We thank you all for the great favour done
In entertainment to my princely queen
Come let us in and with all speed provide
To see her coronation be performd
Exeunt KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK
Brave peers of England pillars of the state
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief
Your grief the common grief of all the land
What did my brother Henry spend his youth
His valour coin and people in the wars
Did he so often lodge in open field
In winters cold and summers parching heat
To conquer France his true inheritance
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
To keep by policy what Henry got
Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham
Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick
Received deep scars in France and Normandy
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself
With all the learned council of the realm
Studied so long sat in the councilhouse
Early and late debating to and fro
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe
And had his highness in his infancy
Crowned in Paris in despite of foes
And shall these labours and these honours die
Shall Henrys conquest Bedfords vigilance
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die
O peers of England shameful is this league
Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
Blotting your names from books of memory
Defacing monuments of conquerd France
Undoing all as all had never been
Nephew what means this passionate discourse
This peroration with such circumstance
For France tis ours and we will keep it still
Ay uncle we will keep it if we can
But now it is impossible we should
Suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse
Now by the death of Him that died for all
These counties were the keys of Normandy
But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son
For grief that they are past recovery
For were there hope to conquer them again
My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
Anjou and Maine myself did win them both
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
And are the cities that I got with wounds
Delivered up again with peaceful words
Mort Dieu
For Suffolks duke may he be suffocate
That dims the honour of this warlike isle
France should have torn and rent my very heart
Before I would have yielded to this league
I never read but Englands kings have had
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
And our King Henry gives away his own
To match with her that brings no vantages
A proper jest and never heard before
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
For costs and charges in transporting her
She should have stayed in France and starved
in France Before
My Lord of Gloucester now ye grow too hot
It was the pleasure of my lord the King
My Lord of Winchester I know your mind
Tis not my speeches that you do mislike
But tis my presence that doth trouble ye
Rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
I see thy fury if I longer stay
We shall begin our ancient bickerings
Lordings farewell and say when I am gone
I prophesied France will be lost ere long
Exit
So there goes our protector in a rage
Tis known to you he is mine enemy
Nay more an enemy unto you all
And no great friend I fear me to the king
Consider lords he is the next of blood
And heir apparent to the English crown
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
Theres reason he should be displeased at it
Look to it lords let not his smoothing words
Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
What though the common people favour him
Calling him Humphrey the good Duke of
Gloucester
Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
Jesu maintain your royal excellence
With God preserve the good Duke Humphrey
I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
He will be found a dangerous protector
Why should he then protect our sovereign
He being of age to govern of himself
Cousin of Somerset join you with me
And all together with the Duke of Suffolk
Well quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat
This weighty business will not brook delay
Ill to the Duke of Suffolk presently
Exit
Cousin of Buckingham though Humphreys pride
And greatness of his place be grief to us
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
His insolence is more intolerable
Than all the princes in the land beside
If Gloucester be displaced hell be protector
Or thou or I Somerset will be protector
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
Pride went before ambition follows him
While these do labour for their own preferment
Behoves it us to labour for the realm
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
Did bear him like a noble gentleman
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal
More like a soldier than a man o the church
As stout and proud as he were lord of all
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal
Warwick my son the comfort of my age
Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey
In bringing them to civil discipline
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France
When thou wert regent for our sovereign
Have made thee feard and honourd of the people
Join we together for the public good
In what we can to bridle and suppress
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal
With Somersets and Buckinghams ambition
And as we may cherish Duke Humphreys deeds
While they do tend the profit of the land
So God help Warwick as he loves the land
And common profit of his country
Aside  And so says York for he hath greatest cause
Then lets make haste away and look unto the main
Unto the main O father Maine is lost
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win
And would have kept so long as breath did last
Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine
Which I will win from France or else be slain
Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY
Anjou and Maine are given to the French
Paris is lost the state of Normandy
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone
Suffolk concluded on the articles
The peers agreed and Henry was well pleased
To change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter
I cannot blame them all what ist to them
Tis thine they give away and not their own
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
And purchase friends and give to courtezans
Still revelling like lords till all be gone
While as the silly owner of the goods
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
While all is shared and all is borne away
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
While his own lands are bargaind for and sold
Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
As did the fatal brand Althaea burnd
Unto the princes heart of Calydon
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French
Cold news for me for I had hope of France
Even as I have of fertile Englands soil
A day will come when York shall claim his own
And therefore I will take the Nevils parts
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey
And when I spy advantage claim the crown
For thats the golden mark I seek to hit
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
Nor wear the diadem upon his head
Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown
Then York be still awhile till time do serve
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep
To pry into the secrets of the state
Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love
With his new bride and Englands dearbought queen
And Humphrey with the peers be falln at jars
Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed
And in my standard bear the arms of York
To grapple with the house of Lancaster
And force perforce Ill make him yield the crown
Whose bookish rule hath pulld fair England down
Exit
Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS
Why droops my lord like overripend corn
Hanging the head at Ceres plenteous load
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows
As frowning at the favours of the world
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
What seest thou there King Henrys diadem
Enchased with all the honours of the world
If so gaze on and grovel on thy face
Until thy head be circled with the same
Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
What ist too short Ill lengthen it with mine
And having both together heaved it up
Well both together lift our heads to heaven
And never more abase our sight so low
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
And may that thought when I imagine ill
Against my king and nephew virtuous Henry
Be my last breathing in this mortal world
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad
What dreamd my lord tell me and Ill requite it
With sweet rehearsal of my mornings dream
Methought this staff mine officebadge in court
Was broke in twain by whom I have forgot
But as I think it was by the cardinal
And on the pieces of the broken wand
Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset
And William de la Pole first duke of Suffolk
This was my dream what it doth bode God knows
Tut this was nothing but an argument
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucesters grove
Shall lose his head for his presumption
But list to me my Humphrey my sweet duke
Methought I sat in seat of majesty
In the cathedral church of Westminster
And in that chair where kings and queens are crownd
Where Henry and dame Margaret kneeld to me
And on my head did set the diadem
Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright
Presumptuous dame illnurtured Eleanor
Art thou not second woman in the realm
And the protectors wife beloved of him
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
Above the reach or compass of thy thought
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
To tumble down thy husband and thyself
From top of honour to disgraces feet

Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk
I go Come Nell thou wilt ride with us
Yes my good lord Ill follow presently
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger
Follow I must I cannot go before
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind
Were I a man a duke and next of blood

And smooth my way upon their headless necks
And being a woman I will not be slack
To play my part in Fortunes pageant
Where are you there Sir John nay fear not man
We are alone heres none but thee and I
Enter HUME
Jesus preserve your royal majesty
What sayst thou majesty I am but grace

And will they undertake to do me good
This they have promised to show your highness
A spirit raised from depth of underground
That shall make answer to such questions

Here Hume take this reward make merry man
With thy confederates in this weighty cause
Exit
Hume must make merry with the duchess gold
Marry and shall But how now Sir John Hume
Seal up your lips and give no words but mum
The business asketh silent secrecy
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
Yet have I gold flies from another coast
I dare not say from the rich cardinal
And from the great and newmade Duke of Suffolk
Yet I do find it so for to be plain
They knowing Dame Eleanors aspiring humour
Have hired me to undermine the duchess
And buz these conjurations in her brain
They say A crafty knave does need no broker
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinals broker
Hume if you take not heed you shall go near
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves
Well so it stands and thus I fear at last
Humes knavery will be the duchess wreck
And her attainture will be Humphreys fall
Sort how it will I shall have gold for all
Exit
Enter three or four Petitioners PETER the Armourers man being one

Against the Duke of Suffolk for enclosing the
commons of Melford How now sir knave
Alas sir I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township
Giving his petition  Against my master Thomas
Horner for saying that the Duke of York was rightful
heir to the crown
What sayst thou did the Duke of York say he was
rightful heir to the crown
That my master was no forsooth my master said
that he was and that the king was an usurper
Who is there
Enter Servant

Exit Servant with PETER
And as for you that love to be protected
Under the wings of our protectors grace
Begin your suits anew and sue to him
Tears the supplication
Away base cullions Suffolk let them go
Come lets be gone
Exeunt
My Lord of Suffolk say is this the guise
Is this the fashion in the court of England
Is this the government of Britains isle
And this the royalty of Albions king
What shall King Henry be a pupil still
Under the surly Gloucesters governance
Am I a queen in title and in style
And must be made a subject to a duke
I tell thee Pole when in the city Tours
Thou ranst a tilt in honour of my love
And stolest away the ladies hearts of France
I thought King Henry had resembled thee
In courage courtship and proportion
But all his mind is bent to holiness
To number AveMaries on his beads
His champions are the prophets and apostles
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ
His study is his tiltyard and his loves
Are brazen images of canonized saints
I would the college of the cardinals
Would choose him pope and carry him to Rome
And set the triple crown upon his head
That were a state fit for his holiness
Madam be patient as I was cause
Your highness came to England so will I
In England work your graces full content
Beside the haughty protector have we Beaufort
The imperious churchman Somerset Buckingham
And grumbling York and not the least of these
But can do more in England than the king
And he of these that can do most of all
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers
Not all these lords do vex me half so much
As that proud dame the lord protectors wife
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
More like an empress than Duke Humphreys wife
Strangers in court do take her for the queen
She bears a dukes revenues on her back
And in her heart she scorns our poverty
Shall I not live to be avenged on her
Contemptuous baseborn callet as she is
She vaunted mongst her minions tother day
The very train of her worst wearing gown
Was better worth than all my fathers lands
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
Madam myself have limed a bush for her
And placed a quire of such enticing birds
That she will light to listen to the lays
And never mount to trouble you again
So let her rest and madam list to me
For I am bold to counsel you in this
Although we fancy not the cardinal
Yet must we join with him and with the lords
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace
As for the Duke of York this late complaint
Will make but little for his benefit
So one by one well weed them all at last
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm
Sound a sennet Enter KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER  CARDINAL BUCKINGHAM YORK SOMERSET SALISBURY WARWICK and the DUCHESS
For my part noble lords I care not which
Or Somerset or York alls one to me
If York have ill demeand himself in France
Then let him be denayd the regentship
If Somerset be unworthy of the place
Let York be regent I will yield to him
Whether your grace be worthy yea or no
Dispute not that York is the worthier
Ambitious Warwick let thy betters speak
The cardinals not my better in the field
All in this presence are thy betters Warwick
Warwick may live to be the best of all
Peace son and show some reason Buckingham
Why Somerset should be preferred in this
Because the king forsooth will have it so
Madam the king is old enough himself
To give his censure these are no womens matters
If he be old enough what needs your grace
To be protector of his excellence
Madam I am protector of the realm
And at his pleasure will resign my place
Resign it then and leave thine insolence
Since thou wert kingas who is king but thou
The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck
The Dauphin hath prevaild beyond the seas
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
The commons hast thou rackd the clergys bags
Are lank and lean with thy extortions
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wifes attire
Have cost a mass of public treasury
Thy cruelty in execution
Upon offenders hath exceeded law
And left thee to the mercy of the law
They sale of offices and towns in France
If they were known as the suspect is great
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head
Exit GLOUCESTER QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan
Give me my fan what minion can ye not
She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear
I cry you mercy madam was it you
Wast I yea I it was proud Frenchwoman
Could I come near your beauty with my nails
Id set my ten commandments in your face
Sweet aunt be quiet twas against her will
Against her will good king look tot in time
Shell hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
Though in this place most master wear no breeches
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged
Exit
Lord cardinal I will follow Eleanor
And listen after Humphrey how he proceeds
Shes tickled now her fume needs no spurs
Shell gallop far enough to her destruction
Exit
Reenter GLOUCESTER
Now lords my choler being overblown
With walking once about the quadrangle
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs
As for your spiteful false objections
Prove them and I lie open to the law
But God in mercy so deal with my soul
As I in duty love my king and country
But to the matter that we have in hand
I say my sovereign York is meetest man
To be your regent in the realm of France
Before we make election give me leave
To show some reason of no little force
That York is most unmeet of any man
Ill tell thee Suffolk why I am unmeet
First for I cannot flatter thee in pride
Next if I be appointed for the place
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here
Without discharge money or furniture
Till France be won into the Dauphins hands
Last time I danced attendance on his will
Till Paris was besieged famishd and lost
Did never traitor in the land commit
Peace headstrong Warwick
Image of pride why should I hold my peace
Enter HORNER the Armourer and his man PETER guarded
Because here is a man accused of treason
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor
What meanst thou Suffolk tell me what are these
Please it your majesty this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason
His words were these that Richard Duke of York
Was rightful heir unto the English crown
And that your majesty was a usurper
Say man were these thy words
Ant shall please your majesty I never said nor
thought any such matter God is my witness I am
falsely accused by the villain
By these ten bones my lords he did speak them to
me in the garret one night as we were scouring my
Lord of Yorks armour
Base dunghill villain and mechanical
Ill have thy head for this thy traitors speech
I do beseech your royal majesty
Let him have all the rigor of the law
Alas my lord hang me if ever I spake the words
My accuser is my prentice and when I did correct
him for his fault the other day he did vow upon his
knees he would be even with me I have good
witness of this therefore I beseech your majesty
do not cast away an honest man for a villains
accusation
Uncle what shall we say to this in law
This doom my lord if I may judge
Let Somerset be regent over the French
Because in York this breeds suspicion
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place
For he hath witness of his servants malice
This is the law and this Duke Humphreys doom
I humbly thank your royal majesty
And I accept the combat willingly
Alas my lord I cannot fight for Gods sake pity
my case The spite of man prevaileth against me O
Lord have mercy upon me I shall never be able to
fight a blow O Lord my heart
Sirrah or you must fight or else be hangd
Away with them to prison and the day of combat
shall be the last of the next month Come
Somerset well see thee sent away

For till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence
Ask what thou wilt That I had said and done
First of the king what shall of him become
Reading out of a paper
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose
But him outlive and die a violent death
As the Spirit speaks SOUTHWELL writes the answer
What fates await the Duke of Suffolk
By water shall he die and take his end
What shall befall the Duke of Somerset
Let him shun castles
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains

Believe me lords for flying at the brook
I saw not better sport these seven years day
Yet by your leave the wind was very high
And ten to one old Joan had not gone out
But what a point my lord your falcon made
And what a pitch she flew above the rest
To see how God in all his creatures works
Yea man and birds are fain of climbing high
No marvel an it like your majesty
My lord protectors hawks do tower so well
They know their master loves to be aloft
And bears his thoughts above his falcons pitch
My lord tis but a base ignoble mind
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar
I thought as much he would be above the clouds
Ay my lord cardinal how think you by that
Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven
The treasury of everlasting joy
Thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts
Beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart
Pernicious protector dangerous peer
That smoothst it so with king and commonweal
What cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory
Tantaene animis coelestibus irae
Churchmen so hot good uncle hide such malice
With such holiness can you do it
No malice sir no more than well becomes
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer
As who my lord
Why as you my lord
Ant like your lordly lordprotectorship

And thy ambition Gloucester

Enter a Townsman of Saint Albans crying A miracle
What means this noise
Fellow what miracle dost thou proclaim

Now God be praised that to believing souls
Gives light in darkness comfort in despair
Enter the Mayor of Saint Albans and his  brethren bearing SIMPCOX between two in a chair SIMPCOXs Wife following
Here comes the townsmen on procession
To present your highness with the man
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied
Stand by my masters bring him near the king
His highness pleasure is to talk with him
Good fellow tell us here the circumstance
That we for thee may glorify the Lord
What hast thou been long blind and now restored
Born blind ant please your grace

At Berwick in the north ant like your grace
Poor soul Gods goodness hath been great to thee
Let never day nor night unhallowd pass
But still remember what the Lord hath done
Tell me good fellow camest thou here by chance
Or of devotion to this holy shrine
God knows of pure devotion being calld
A hundred times and oftener in my sleep
By good Saint Alban who said Simpcox come
Come offer at my shrine and I will help thee
Most true forsooth and many time and oft
Myself have heard a voice to call him so
What art thou lame
Ay God Almighty help me
How camest thou so
A fall off of a tree
A plumtree master
How long hast thou been blind
Born so master
What and wouldst climb a tree
But that in all my life when I was a youth
Too true and bought his climbing very dear
Mass thou lovedst plums well that wouldst
venture so
Alas  good master my wife desired some damsons
And made me climb with danger of my life
A subtle knave but yet it shall not serve
Let me see thine eyes wink now now open them
In my opinion yet thou seest not well
Yes master clear as day I thank God and
Saint Alban
Sayst thou me so What colour is this cloak of
Red master red as blood
Why thats well said What colour is my gown of
Black forsooth coalblack as jet

But cloaks and gowns before this day a many
Never before this day in all his life
Tell me sirrah whats my name
Alas master I know not
Whats his name

Nor his
No indeed master
Whats thine own name
Saunder Simpcox an if it please you master
Then Saunder sit there the lyingest knave in
Christendom If thou hadst been born blind thou

name the several colours we do wear Sight may
distinguish of colours but suddenly to nominate them
all it is impossible My lords Saint Alban here
hath done a miracle and would ye not think his
cunning to be great that could restore this cripple
to his legs again
O master that you could
My masters of Saint Albans have you not beadles in

Then send for one presently
Sirrah go fetch the beadle hither straight
Exit an Attendant
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by Now sirrah

You go about to torture me in vain
Enter a Beadle with whips
Well sir we must have you find your legs Sirrah
beadle whip him till he leap over that same stool
I will my lord Come on sirrah off with your
doublet quickly
Alas master what shall I do I am not able to stand
After the Beadle hath hit him once he leaps over the stool and runs away and they follow and cry A miracle
O God seest Thou this and bearest so long
It made me laugh to see the villain run
Follow the knave and take this drab away
Alas sir we did it for pure need
Let them be whipped through every markettown till
they come to Berwick from whence they came
Exeunt Wife Beadle Mayor  and c
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle today
True made the lame to leap and fly away
But you have done more miracles than I
You made in a day my lord whole towns to fly
Enter BUCKINGHAM
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
A sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
Under the countenance and confederacy
Of Lady Eleanor the protectors wife
The ringleader and head of all this rout
Dealing with witches and with conjurers
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground
Demanding of King Henrys life and death
And other of your highness privycouncil
As more at large your grace shall understand
Aside to GLOUCESTER  And so my lord protector
by this means
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London
This news I think hath turnd your weapons edge
Tis like my lord you will not keep your hour
Ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
Sorrow and grief have vanquishd all my powers
And vanquishd as I am I yield to thee
Or to the meanest groom
O God what mischiefs work the wicked ones
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby
Gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
And look thyself be faultless thou wert best
Madam for myself to heaven I do appeal
How I have loved my king and commonweal
And for my wife I know not how it stands
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard
Noble she is but if she have forgot
Honour and virtue and conversed with such
As like to pitch defile nobility
I banish her my bed and company
And give her as a prey to law and shame
That hath dishonourd Gloucesters honest name
Well for this night we will repose us here
Tomorrow toward London back again
To look into this business thoroughly
And call these foul offenders to their answers
And poise the cause in justice equal scales
Whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails
Flourish Exeunt
Enter YORK SALISBURY and WARWICK
Now my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
Our simple supper ended give me leave
In this close walk to satisfy myself
In craving your opinion of my title
Which is infallible to Englands crown
My lord I long to hear it at full
Sweet York begin and if thy claim be good
The Nevils are thy subjects to command
Then thus
Edward the Third my lords had seven sons
The first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales
The second William of Hatfield and the third
Lionel Duke of Clarence next to whom
Was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster
The fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester
William of Windsor was the seventh and last
Edward the Black Prince died before his father
And left behind him Richard his only son
Who after Edward the Thirds death reignd as king
Till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt
Crownd by the name of Henry the Fourth
Seized on the realm deposed the rightful king
Sent his poor queen to France from whence she came
And him to Pomfret where as all you know
Harmless Richard was murderd traitorously
Father the duke hath told the truth
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown
Which now they hold by force and not by right
For Richard the first sons heir being dead
The issue of the next son should have reignd
But William of Hatfield died without an heir
The third son Duke of Clarence from whose line
I claimed the crown had issue Philippe a daughter
Who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March
Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March
Roger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor
This Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke
As I have read laid claim unto the crown
And but for Owen Glendower had been king
Who kept him in captivity till he died
But to the rest
His eldest sister Anne
My mother being heir unto the crown
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge who was son
To Edmund Langley Edward the Thirds fifth son
By her I claim the kingdom she was heir
To Roger Earl of March who was the son
Of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippe
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence
So if the issue of the elder son
Succeed before the younger I am king
What plain proceeding is more plain than this
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt
The fourth son York claims it from the third
Till Lionels issue fails his should not reign
It fails not yet but flourishes in thee
And in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
Then father Salisbury kneel we together
And in this private plot be we the first
That shall salute our rightful sovereign
With honour of his birthright to the crown
Long live our sovereign Richard Englands king
We thank you lords But I am not your king
Till I be crownd and that my sword be staind
With heartblood of the house of Lancaster
And thats not suddenly to be performd
But with advice and silent secrecy
Do you as I do in these dangerous days
Wink at the Duke of Suffolks insolence
At Beauforts pride at Somersets ambition
At Buckingham and all the crew of them
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock
That virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey
Tis that they seek and they in seeking that
Shall find their deaths if York can prophesy
My lord break we off we know your mind at full
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king
And Nevil this I do assure myself
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
The greatest man in England but the king

From thence unto the place of execution
The witch in Smithfield shall be burnd to ashes
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows
You madam for you are more nobly born
Despoiled of your honour in your life

Give up thy staff Henry will to himself
Protector be and God shall be my hope
My stay my guide and lantern to my feet
And go in peace Humphrey no less beloved
Than when thou wert protector to thy King
I see no reason why a king of years
Should be to be protected like a child
God and King Henry govern Englands realm
Give up your staff sir and the king his realm
My staff here noble Henry is my staff
As willingly do I the same resign
As eer thy father Henry made it mine
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
As others would ambitiously receive it
Farewell good king when I am dead and gone
May honourable peace attend thy throne

For his death we do perceive his guilt
And God in justice hath revealed to us
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow
Which he had thought to have murderd wrongfully
Come fellow follow us for thy reward
Sound a flourish Exeunt
Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen in mourning cloaks
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud
And after summer evermore succeeds
Barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold
So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
Sirs whats oclock
Ten my lord
Ten is the hour that was appointed me
To watch the coming of my punishd duchess
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets
To tread them with her tenderfeeling feet
Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
The abject people gazing on thy face
With envious looks laughing at thy shame
That erst did follow thy proud chariotwheels
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
But soft I think she comes and Ill prepare
My tearstaind eyes to see her miseries
Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet and a taper  burning in her hand with STANLEY the Sheriff and Officers
So please your grace well take her from the sheriff
No stir not for your lives let her pass by
Come you my lord to see my open shame
Now thou dost penance too Look how they gaze
See how the giddy multitude do point
And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
Ah Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
And in thy closet pent up rue my shame
And ban thine enemies both mine and thine
Be patient gentle Nell forget this grief
Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself
For whilst I think I am thy married wife
And thou a prince protector of this land
Methinks I should not thus be led along
Maild up in shame with papers on my back
And followed with a rabble that rejoice
To see my tears and hear my deepfet groans
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
And when I start the envious people laugh
And bid me be advised how I tread
Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke
Trowst thou that eer Ill look upon the world
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun
No dark shall be my light and night my day
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell
Sometime Ill say I am Duke Humphreys wife
And he a prince and ruler of the land
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess
Was made a wonder and a pointingstock
To every idle rascal follower
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
Hang over thee as sure it shortly will
For Suffolk he that can do all in all
With her that hateth thee and hates us all
And York and impious Beaufort that false priest
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings
And fly thou how thou canst theyll tangle thee
But fear not thou until thy foot be snared
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes
Ah Nell forbear thou aimest all awry
I must offend before I be attainted
And had I twenty times so many foes
And each of them had twenty times their power
All these could not procure me any scathe
So long as I am loyal true and crimeless
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
Why yet thy scandal were not wiped away
But I in danger for the breach of law
Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell
I pray thee sort thy heart to patience
These few days wonder will be quickly worn
Enter a Herald
I summon your grace to his majestys parliament
Holden at Bury the first of this next month
And my consent neer askd herein before
This is close dealing Well I will be there
Exit Herald
My Nell I take my leave and master sheriff
Let not her penance exceed the kings commission
Ant please your grace here my commission stays
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
To take her with him to the Isle of Man
Must you Sir John protect my lady here
So am I given in charge mayt please your grace
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
You use her well the world may laugh again
And I may live to do you kindness if
You do it her and so Sir John farewell
What gone my lord and bid me not farewell
Witness my tears I cannot stay to speak
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen
Art thou gone too all comfort go with thee
For none abides with me my joy is death
Death at whose name I oft have been afeard
Because I wishd this worlds eternity
Stanley I prithee go and take me hence
I care not whither for I beg no favour
Only convey me where thou art commanded
Why madam that is to the Isle of Man
There to be used according to your state
Thats bad enough for I am but reproach
And shall I then be used reproachfully
Like to a duchess and Duke Humphreys lady
According to that state you shall be used
Sheriff farewell and better than I fare
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame
It is my office and madam pardon me
Ay ay farewell thy office is discharged
Come Stanley shall we go
Madam your penance done throw off this sheet
And go we to attire you for our journey
My shame will not be shifted with my sheet
No it will hang upon my richest robes
And show itself attire me how I can
Go lead the way I long to see my prison
Exeunt
Sound a sennet Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN  MARGARET CARDINAL SUFFOLK YORK BUCKINGHAM SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come
Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
Whateer occasion keeps him from us now
Can you not see or will ye not observe
The strangeness of his alterd countenance
With what a majesty he bears himself
How insolent of late he is become
How proud how peremptory and unlike himself
We know the time since he was mild and affable
And if we did but glance a faroff look
Immediately he was upon his knee
That all the court admired him for submission
But meet him now and be it in the morn
When every one will give the time of day
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
Disdaining duty that to us belongs
Small curs are not regarded when they grin
But great men tremble when the lion roars
And Humphrey is no little man in England
First note that he is near you in descent
And should you fall he as the next will mount
Me seemeth then it is no policy
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
And his advantage following your decease
That he should come about your royal person
Or be admitted to your highness council
By flattery hath he won the commons hearts
And when he please to make commotion
Tis to be feard they all will follow him
Now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted
Suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry
The reverent care I bear unto my lord
Made me collect these dangers in the duke
If it be fond call it a womans fear
Which fear if better reasons can supplant
I will subscribe and say I wrongd the duke
My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York
Reprove my allegation if you can
Or else conclude my words effectual
Well hath your highness seen into this duke
And had I first been put to speak my mind
I think I should have told your graces tale
The duchess by his subornation
Or if he were not privy to those faults
Yet by reputing of his high descent
As next the king he was successive heir
And such high vaunts of his nobility
Did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
By wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
And in his simple show he harbours treason
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
Did he not contrary to form of law
Devise strange deaths for small offences done
And did he not in his protectorship
Levy great sums of money through the realm
For soldiers pay in France and never sent it
By means whereof the towns each day revolted
Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
Which time will bring to light in smooth
Duke Humphrey
My lords at once the care you have of us
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
From meaning treason to our royal person
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
The duke is virtuous mild and too well given
To dream on evil or to work my downfall
Ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance
Seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed
For hes disposed as the hateful raven
Is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him
For hes inclined as is the ravenous wolf
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
Take heed my lord the welfare of us all
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
Enter SOMERSET
All health unto my gracious sovereign
Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France
That all your interest in those territories
Is utterly bereft you all is lost
Cold news Lord Somerset but Gods will be done
Aside  Cold news for me for I had hope of France
As firmly as I hope for fertile England
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
And caterpillars eat my leaves away
But I will remedy this gear ere long
Or sell my title for a glorious grave
Enter GLOUCESTER
All happiness unto my lord the king
Pardon my liege that I have stayd so long
Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
I do arrest thee of high treason here
Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
Nor change my countenance for this arrest
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted
The purest spring is not so free from mud
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign
Who can accuse me wherein am I guilty
Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France
And being protector stayed the soldiers pay
By means whereof his highness hath lost France
Is it but thought so what are they that think it
I never robbd the soldiers of their pay
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France
So help me God as I have watchd the night
Ay night by night in studying good for England
That doit that eer I wrested from the king
Or any groat I hoarded to my use
Be brought against me at my trialday
No many a pound of mine own proper store
Because I would not tax the needy commons
Have I disbursed to the garrisons
And never askd for restitution
It serves you well my lord to say so much
I say no more than truth so help me God
In your protectorship you did devise
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of
That England was defamed by tyranny
Why tis well known that whiles I was
protector
Pity was all the fault that was in me
For I should melt at an offenders tears
And lowly words were ransom for their fault
Unless it were a bloody murderer
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers
I never gave them condign punishment
Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortured
Above the felon or what trespass else
My lord these faults are easy quickly answered
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
I do arrest you in his highness name
And here commit you to my lord cardinal
To keep until your further time of trial
My lord of Gloucester tis my special hope
That you will clear yourself from all suspect
My conscience tells me you are innocent
Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
Virtue is choked with foul ambition
And charity chased hence by rancours hand
Foul subornation is predominant
And equity exiled your highness land
I know their complot is to have my life
And if my death might make this island happy
And prove the period of their tyranny
I would expend it with all willingness
But mine is made the prologue to their play
For thousands more that yet suspect no peril
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy
Beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice
And Suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
The envious load that lies upon his heart
And dogged York that reaches at the moon
Whose overweening arm I have pluckd back
By false accuse doth level at my life
And you my sovereign lady with the rest
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head
And with your best endeavour have stirrd up
My liefest liege to be mine enemy
Ay all you have laid your heads together
Myself had notice of your conventicles
And all to make away my guiltless life
I shall not want false witness to condemn me
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
The ancient proverb will be well effected
A staff is quickly found to beat a dog
My liege his railing is intolerable
If those that care to keep your royal person
From treasons secret knife and traitors rage
Be thus upbraided chid and rated at
And the offender granted scope of speech
Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
With ignominious words though clerkly couchd
As if she had suborned some to swear
False allegations to oerthrow his state
But I can give the loser leave to chide
Far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed
Beshrew the winners for they playd me false
And well such losers may have leave to speak
Hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day
Lord cardinal he is your prisoner
Sirs take away the duke and guard him sure
Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch
Before his legs be firm to bear his body
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
Ah that my fear were false ah that it were
For good King Henry thy decay I fear
Exit guarded
My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
Do or undo as if ourself were here
What will your highness leave the parliament
Ay Margaret my heart is drownd with grief
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
My body round engirt with misery
For whats more miserable than discontent
Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see
The map of honour truth and loyalty
And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come
That eer I proved thee false or feard thy faith
What louring star now envies thy estate
That these great lords and Margaret our queen
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life
Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
And as the butcher takes away the calf
And binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence
And as the dam runs lowing up and down
Looking the way her harmless young one went
And can do nought but wail her darlings loss
Even so myself bewails good Gloucesters case
With sad unhelpful tears and with dimmd eyes
Look after him and cannot do him good
So mighty are his vowed enemies
His fortunes I will weep and twixt each groan
Say Whos a traitor Gloucester he is none
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET CARDINAL SUFFOLK and YORK SOMERSET remains apart
Free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs
Too full of foolish pity and Gloucesters show
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
With sorrow snares relenting passengers
Or as the snake rolld in a flowering bank
With shining chequerd slough doth sting a child
That for the beauty thinks it excellent
Believe me lords were none more wise than I
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
To rid us of the fear we have of him
That he should die is worthy policy
But yet we want a colour for his death
Tis meet he be condemnd by course of law
But in my mind that were no policy
The king will labour still to save his life
The commons haply rise to save his life
And yet we have but trivial argument
More than mistrust that shows him worthy death
So that by this you would not have him die
Ah York no man alive so fain as I
Tis York that hath more reason for his death
But my lord cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk
Say as you think and speak it from your souls
Weret not all one an empty eagle were set
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite
As place Duke Humphrey for the kings protector
So the poor chicken should be sure of death
Madam tis true and weret not madness then
To make the fox surveyor of the fold
Who being accused a crafty murderer
His guilt should be but idly posted over
Because his purpose is not executed
No let him die in that he is a fox
By nature proved an enemy to the flock
Before his chaps be staind with crimson blood
As Humphrey proved by reasons to my liege
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him
Be it by gins by snares by subtlety
Sleeping or waking tis no matter how
So he be dead for that is good deceit
Which mates him first that first intends deceit
Thricenoble Suffolk tis resolutely spoke
Not resolute except so much were done
For things are often spoke and seldom meant
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue
Seeing the deed is meritorious
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe
Say but the word and I will be his priest
But I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk
Ere you can take due orders for a priest
Say you consent and censure well the deed
And Ill provide his executioner
I tender so the safety of my liege
Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
And so say I
And I    and now we three have spoke it
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom
Enter a Post
Great lords from Ireland am I come amain
To signify that rebels there are up
And put the Englishmen unto the sword
Send succors lords and stop the rage betime
Before the wound do grow uncurable
For being green there is great hope of help
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop
What counsel give you in this weighty cause
That Somerset be sent as regent thither
Tis meet that lucky ruler be employd
Witness the fortune he hath had in France
If York with all his farfet policy
Had been the regent there instead of me
He never would have stayd in France so long
No not to lose it all as thou hast done
I rather would have lost my life betimes
Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
By staying there so long till all were lost
Mens flesh preserved so whole do seldom win
Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
No more good York sweet Somerset be still
Thy fortune York hadst thou been regent there
Might happily have proved far worse than his
What worse than nought nay then a shame take all
And in the number thee that wishest shame
My Lord of York try what your fortune is
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen
To Ireland will you lead a band of men
Collected choicely from each county some
And try your hap against the Irishmen
I will my lord so please his majesty
Why our authority is his consent
And what we do establish he confirms
Then noble York take thou this task in hand
I am content provide me soldiers lords
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs
A charge Lord York that I will see performd
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey
No more of him for I will deal with him
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more
And so break off the day is almost spent
Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event
My Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days
At Bristol I expect my soldiers
For there Ill ship them all for Ireland
Ill see it truly done my Lord of York
Exeunt all but YORK
Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts
And change misdoubt to resolution
Be that thou hopest to be or what thou art
Resign to death it is not worth the enjoying
Let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man
And find no harbour in a royal heart
Faster than springtime showers comes thought
on thought
And not a thought but thinks on dignity
My brain more busy than the labouring spider
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
Well nobles well tis politicly done
To send me packing with an host of men
I fear me you but warm the starved snake
Who cherishd in your breasts will sting
your hearts
Twas men I lackd and you will give them me
I take it kindly and yet be well assured
You put sharp weapons in a madmans hands
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band
I will stir up in England some black storm
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
Until the golden circuit on my head
Like to the glorious suns transparent beams
Do calm the fury of this madbred flaw
And for a minister of my intent
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman
John Cade of Ashford
To make commotion as full well he can
Under the title of John Mortimer
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns
And fought so long till that his thighs with darts
Were almost like a sharpquilld porpentine
And in the end being rescued I have seen
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
Full often like a shaghaird crafty kern
Hath he conversed with the enemy
And undiscoverd come to me again
And given me notice of their villanies
This devil here shall be my substitute
For that John Mortimer which now is dead
In face in gait in speech he doth resemble
By this I shall perceive the commons mind
How they affect the house and claim of York
Say he be taken rackd and tortured
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
Will make him say I moved him to those arms
Say that he thrive as tis great like he will
Why then from Ireland come I with my strength
And reap the harvest which that rascal sowd
For Humphrey being dead as he shall be
And Henry put apart the next for me
Exit
Enter certain Murderers hastily
Run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know
We have dispatchd the duke as he commanded
O that it were to do What have we done
Didst ever hear a man so penitent
Enter SUFFOLK
Here comes my lord
Now sirs have you dispatchd this thing
Ay my good lord hes dead
Why thats well said Go get you to my house
I will reward you for this venturous deed
The king and all the peers are here at hand
Have you laid fair the bed Is all things well
According as I gave directions
Tis my good lord
Away be gone
Exeunt Murderers
Sound trumpets Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET CARDINAL SOMERSET with Attendants
Go call our uncle to our presence straight
Say we intend to try his grace today
If he be guilty as tis published
Ill call him presently my noble lord
Exit
Lords take your places and I pray you all
Proceed no straiter gainst our uncle Gloucester
Than from true evidence of good esteem
God forbid any malice should prevail
That faultless may condemn a nobleman
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion
I thank thee Meg these words content me much
Reenter SUFFOLK
How now why lookst thou pale why tremblest thou
Where is our uncle whats the matter Suffolk
Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead
Marry God forfend
Gods secret judgment I did dream tonight
The duke was dumb and could not speak a word
KING HENRY VI swoons
How fares my lord Help lords the king is dead
Rear up his body wring him by the nose
Run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes
He doth revive again madam be patient
O heavenly God
How fares my gracious lord
Comfort my sovereign gracious Henry comfort
What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me
Came he right now to sing a ravens note
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren
By crying comfort from a hollow breast
Can chase away the firstconceived sound
Hide not thy poison with such sugard words
Lay not thy hands on me forbear I say
Their touch affrights me as a serpents sting
Thou baleful messenger out of my sight
Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world
Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
Yet do not go away come basilisk
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
For in the shade of death I shall find joy
In life but double death now Gloucesters dead
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus
Although the duke was enemy to him
Yet he most Christianlike laments his death
And for myself foe as he was to me
Might liquid tears or heartoffending groans
Or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life
I would be blind with weeping sick with groans
Look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs
And all to have the noble duke alive
What know I how the world may deem of me
For it is known we were but hollow friends
It may be judged I made the duke away
So shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded
And princes courts be filld with my reproach
This get I by his death ay me unhappy
To be a queen and crownd with infamy
Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man
Be woe for me more wretched than he is
What dost thou turn away and hide thy face
I am no loathsome leper look on me
What art thou like the adder waxen deaf
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucesters tomb
Why then dame Margaret was neer thy joy
Erect his statue and worship it
And make my image but an alehouse sign
Was I for this nigh wreckd upon the sea
And twice by awkward wind from Englands bank
Drove back again unto my native clime
What boded this but well forewarning wind
Did seem to say Seek not a scorpions nest
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore
What did I then but cursed the gentle gusts
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves
And bid them blow towards Englands blessed shore
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
Yet AEolus would not be a murderer
But left that hateful office unto thee
The prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
The splitting rocks cowerd in the sinking sands
And would not dash me with their ragged sides
Because thy flinty heart more hard than they
Might in thy palace perish Margaret
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back
I stood upon the hatches in the storm
And when the dusky sky began to rob
My earnestgaping sight of thy lands view
I took a costly jewel from my neck
A heart it was bound in with diamonds
And threw it towards thy land the sea received it
And so I wishd thy body might my heart
And even with this I lost fair Englands view
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
And calld them blind and dusky spectacles
For losing ken of Albions wished coast
How often have I tempted Suffolks tongue
The agent of thy foul inconstancy
To sit and witch me as Ascanius did
When he to madding Dido would unfold
Am I not witchd like her or thou not false like him
Ay me I can no more die Margaret
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long
Noise within Enter WARWICK SALISBURY and many Commons
It is reported mighty sovereign
That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murderd
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beauforts means
The commons like an angry hive of bees
That want their leader scatter up and down
And care not who they sting in his revenge
Myself have calmd their spleenful mutiny
Until they hear the order of his death
That he is dead good Warwick tis too true
But how he died God knows not Henry
Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
And comment then upon his sudden death
That shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury
With the rude multitude till I return
Exit
O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
Some violent hands were laid on Humphreys life
If my suspect be false forgive me God
For judgment only doth belong to thee
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
But all in vain are these mean obsequies
And to survey his dead and earthly image
What were it but to make my sorrow greater
Reenter WARWICK and others bearing GLOUCESTERS body on a bed
Come hither gracious sovereign view this body
That is to see how deep my grave is made
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace
For seeing him I see my life in death
As surely as my soul intends to live
With that dread King that took our state upon him
To free us from his fathers wrathful curse
I do believe that violent hands were laid
Upon the life of this thricefamed duke
A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow
See how the blood is settled in his face
Oft have I seen a timelyparted ghost
Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
Being all descended to the labouring heart
Who in the conflict that it holds with death
Which with the heart there cools and neer returneth
To blush and beautify the cheek again
But see his face is black and full of blood
His eyeballs further out than when he lived
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man
His hair upreard his nostrils stretched with struggling
His hands abroad displayd as one that graspd
And tuggd for life and was by strength subdued
Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
His wellproportiond beard made rough and rugged
Like to the summers corn by tempest lodged
It cannot be but he was murderd here
The least of all these signs were probable
Why Warwick who should do the duke to death
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection
And we I hope sir are no murderers
But both of you were vowd Duke Humphreys foes
And you forsooth had the good duke to keep
Tis like you would not feast him like a friend
And tis well seen he found an enemy
Then you belike suspect these noblemen
As guilty of Duke Humphreys timeless death
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe
But will suspect twas he that made the slaughter
Who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest
But may imagine how the bird was dead
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
Even so suspicious is this tragedy
Are you the butcher Suffolk Wheres your knife
Is Beaufort termd a kite Where are his talons
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
But heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
That slanders me with murders crimson badge
Say if thou darest proud Lord of Warwickshire
That I am faulty in Duke Humphreys death
Exeunt CARDINAL SOMERSET and others
What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
Madam be still with reverence may I say
For every word you speak in his behalf
Is slander to your royal dignity
Bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor
If ever lady wrongd her lord so much
Thy mother took into her blameful bed
Some stern untutord churl and noble stock
Was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art
And never of the Nevils noble race
But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
And that my sovereigns presence makes me mild
I would false murderous coward on thy knee
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
And say it was thy mother that thou meantst
That thou thyself was born in bastardy
And after all this fearful homage done
Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men
Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood
If from this presence thou darest go with me
Away even now or I will drag thee hence
Unworthy though thou art Ill cope with thee
And do some service to Duke Humphreys ghost
Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just
And he but naked though lockd up in steel
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
A noise within
What noise is this
Reenter SUFFOLK and WARWICK with their weapons drawn
Why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
Here in our presence dare you be so bold
Why what tumultuous clamour have we here
The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
Set all upon me mighty sovereign
To the Commons entering  Sirs stand apart
the king shall know your mind
Dread lord the commons send you word by me
Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death
Or banished fair Englands territories
They will by violence tear him from your palace
And torture him with grievous lingering death
They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died
They say in him they fear your highness death
And mere instinct of love and loyalty
Free from a stubborn opposite intent
As being thought to contradict your liking
Makes them thus forward in his banishment
They say in care of your most royal person
That if your highness should intend to sleep
And charge that no man should disturb your rest
In pain of your dislike or pain of death
Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
That slily glided towards your majesty
It were but necessary you were waked
Lest being sufferd in that harmful slumber
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
And therefore do they cry though you forbid
That they will guard you whether you will or no
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is
With whose envenomed and fatal sting
Your loving uncle twenty times his worth
They say is shamefully bereft of life
Within  An answer from the king my
Lord of Salisbury
Tis like the commons rude unpolishd hinds
Could send such message to their sovereign
But you my lord were glad to be employd
To show how quaint an orator you are
But all the honour Salisbury hath won
Is that he was the lord ambassador
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king
Within  An answer from the king or we will all break in
Go Salisbury and tell them all from me
I thank them for their tender loving care
And had I not been cited so by them
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat
For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
Mischance unto my state by Suffolks means
And therefore by His majesty I swear
Whose far unworthy deputy I am
He shall not breathe infection in this air
But three days longer on the pain of death
Exit SALISBURY
O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk
Ungentle queen to call him gentle Suffolk
No more I say if thou dost plead for him
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
Had I but said I would have kept my word
But when I swear it is irrevocable
If after three days space thou here best found
On any ground that I am ruler of
The world shall not be ransom for thy life
Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me
I have great matters to impart to thee
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK
Mischance and sorrow go along with you
Hearts discontent and sour affliction
Be playfellows to keep you company
Theres two of you the devil make a third
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
Cease gentle queen these execrations
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave
Fie coward woman and softhearted wretch
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
A plague upon them wherefore should I curse them
Would curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan
I would invent as bittersearching terms
As curst as harsh and horrible to hear
Deliverd strongly through my fixed teeth
With full as many signs of deadly hate
As leanfaced Envy in her loathsome cave
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
And even now my burthend heart would break
Should I not curse them Poison be their drink
Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks
Their softest touch as smart as lizards sting
Their music frightful as the serpents hiss
And boding screechowls make the concert full
All the foul terrors in darkseated hell
Enough sweet Suffolk thou tormentst thyself
And these dread curses like the sun gainst glass
Or like an overcharged gun recoil
And turn the force of them upon thyself
You bade me ban and will you bid me leave
Now by the ground that I am banishd from
Well could I curse away a winters night
Though standing naked on a mountain top
Where biting cold would never let grass grow
And think it but a minute spent in sport
O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand
That I may dew it with my mournful tears
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
To wash away my woful monuments
O could this kiss be printed in thy hand
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal
Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee
So get thee gone that I may know my grief
Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by
As one that surfeits thinking on a want
I will repeal thee or be well assured
Adventure to be banished myself
And banished I am if but from thee
Go speak not to me even now be gone
O go not yet Even thus two friends condemnd
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
Loather a hundred times to part than die
Yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished
Once by the king and three times thrice by thee
Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence
A wilderness is populous enough
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company
For where thou art there is the world itself
With every several pleasure in the world
And where thou art not desolation
I can no more live thou to joy thy life
Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest
Enter VAUX
Wither goes Vaux so fast what news I prithee
To signify unto his majesty
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him
That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth
Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphreys ghost
Were by his side sometime he calls the king
And whispers to his pillow as to him
The secrets of his overcharged soul
And I am sent to tell his majesty
That even now he cries aloud for him
Go tell this heavy message to the king
Exit VAUX
Ay me what is this world what news are these
But wherefore grieve I at an hours poor loss
Omitting Suffolks exile my souls treasure
Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee
And with the southern clouds contend in tears
Theirs for the earths increase mine for my sorrows
Now get thee hence the king thou knowst is coming
If thou be found by me thou art but dead
If I depart from thee I cannot live
And in thy sight to die what were it else
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
Here could I breathe my soul into the air
As mild and gentle as the cradlebabe
Dying with mothers dug between its lips
Where from thy sight I should be raging mad
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
Or I should breathe it so into thy body
And then it lived in sweet Elysium
To die by thee were but to die in jest
From thee to die were torture more than death
O let me stay befall what may befall
Away though parting be a fretful corrosive
It is applied to a deathful wound
To France sweet Suffolk let me hear from thee
For wheresoeer thou art in this worlds globe
Ill have an Iris that shall find thee out
I go
And take my heart with thee
A jewel lockd into the wofullst cask
That ever did contain a thing of worth
Even as a splitted bark so sunder we
This way fall I to death
This way for me
Exeunt severally
Enter the KING SALISBURY WARWICK to the CARDINAL in bed
How fares my lord speak Beaufort to
thy sovereign
If thou best death Ill give thee Englands treasure
Enough to purchase such another island
So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain
Ah what a sign it is of evil life
Where deaths approach is seen so terrible
Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee
Bring me unto my trial when you will
Died he not in his bed where should he die
Can I make men live whether they will or no
O torture me no more I will confess
Alive again then show me where he is
Ill give a thousand pound to look upon him
He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them
Comb down his hair look look it stands upright
Like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul
Give me some drink and bid the apothecary
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
O beat away the busy meddling fiend
That lays strong siege unto this wretchs soul
And from his bosom purge this black despair
See how the pangs of death do make him grin
Disturb him not let him pass peaceably
Peace to his soul if Gods good pleasure be
Lord cardinal if thou thinkst on heavens bliss
Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
He dies and makes no sign O God forgive him
So bad a death argues a monstrous life
Forbear to judge for we are sinners all
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close
And let us all to meditation
Exeunt
Alarum Fight at sea Ordnance goes off Enter a  Captain a Master a Mastersmate WALTER WHITMORE and others with them SUFFOLK and others prisoners
The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
Is crept into the bosom of the sea
And now loudhowling wolves arouse the jades
That drag the tragic melancholy night
Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
Clip dead mens graves and from their misty jaws
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand
Or with their blood stain this discolourd shore
Master this prisoner freely give I thee
And thou that art his mate make boot of this
The other Walter Whitmore is thy share
What is my ransom master let me know
A thousand crowns or else lay down your head
MastersMateAnd so much shall you give or off goes yours
What think you much to pay two thousand crowns
And bear the name and port of gentlemen
Cut both the villains throats for die you shall
The lives of those which we have lost in fight
Be counterpoised with such a petty sum
Ill give it sir and therefore spare my life
And so will I and write home for it straight
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die
To SUFFOLK
And so should these if I might have my will
Be not so rash take ransom let him live
Look on my George I am a gentleman
Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid
And so am I my name is Walter Whitmore
How now why startst thou what doth
death affright
Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
A cunning man did calculate my birth
And told me that by water I should die
Yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded
Thy name is Gaultier being rightly sounded
Gaultier or Walter which it is I care not
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
But with our sword we wiped away the blot
Therefore when merchantlike I sell revenge
Broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced
And I proclaimd a coward through the world
Stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags
Ay but these rags are no part of the duke
Jove sometimes went disguised and why not I
But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be
Obscure and lowly swain King Henrys blood
The honourable blood of Lancaster
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom
Hast thou not kissd thy hand and held my stirrup
Bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule
And thought thee happy when I shook my head
How often hast thou waited at my cup
Fed from my trencher kneeld down at the board
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret
Remember it and let it make thee crestfalln
Ay and allay this thy abortive pride
How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
And duly waited for my coming forth
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
Speak captain shall I stab the forlorn swain
First let my words stab him as he hath me
Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
Convey him hence and on our longboats side
Strike off his head
Thou darest not for thy own
Yes Pole
Pole
Pool Sir Pool lord
Ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
For swallowing the treasure of the realm
Thy lips that kissd the queen shall sweep the ground
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphreys death
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
For daring to affy a mighty lord
Unto the daughter of a worthless king
Having neither subject wealth nor diadem
By devilish policy art thou grown great
And like ambitious Sylla overgorged
With gobbets of thy mothers bleeding heart
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France
The false revolting Normans thorough thee
Disdain to call us lord and Picardy
Hath slain their governors surprised our forts
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
The princely Warwick and the Nevils all
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
As hating thee are rising up in arms
And now the house of York thrust from the crown
By shameful murder of a guiltless king
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny
Burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
Advance our halffaced sun striving to shine
Under the which is writ Invitis nubibus
The commons here in Kent are up in arms
And to conclude reproach and beggary
Is crept into the palace of our king
And all by thee Away convey him hence
O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder
Upon these paltry servile abject drudges
Small things make base men proud this villain here
Being captain of a pinnace threatens more
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate
Drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives
It is impossible that I should die
By such a lowly vassal as thyself
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me
I go of message from the queen to France
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel
Walter
Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death
Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee
What are ye daunted now now will ye stoop
My gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
Suffolks imperial tongue is stern and rough
Used to command untaught to plead for favour
Far be it we should honour such as these
With humble suit no rather let my head
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
Save to the God of heaven and to my king
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
Than stand uncoverd to the vulgar groom
True nobility is exempt from fear
More can I bear than you dare execute
Hale him away and let him talk no more
Come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
That this my death may never be forgot
Great men oft die by vile bezonians
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
Murderd sweet Tully Brutus bastard hand
Stabbd Julius Caesar savage islanders
Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates
Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk
And as for these whose ransom we have set
It is our pleasure one of them depart
Therefore come you with us and let him go
Exeunt all but the First Gentleman
Reenter WHITMORE with SUFFOLKs body
There let his head and lifeless body lie
Until the queen his mistress bury it
Exit
O barbarous and bloody spectacle
His body will I bear unto the king
If he revenge it not yet will his friends
So will the queen that living held him dear
Exit with the body
Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND
Come and get thee a sword though made of a lath

They have the more need to sleep now then
I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress
the commonwealth and turn it and set a new nap upon it
So he had need for tis threadbare Well I say it
was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up
O miserable age virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons
Nay more the kings council are no good workmen
True and yet it is said labour in thy vocation
which is as much to say as let the magistrates be
labouring men and therefore should we be
magistrates
Thou hast hit it for theres no better sign of a
brave mind than a hard hand
I see them I see them theres Bests son the
tanner of Wingham
He shall have the skin of our enemies to make
dogsleather of
And Dick the Butcher
Then is sin struck down like an ox and iniquitys
throat cut like a calf
And Smith the weaver
Argo their thread of life is spun
Come come lets fall in with them
Drum Enter CADE DICK the Butcher SMITH the Weaver and a Sawyer with infinite numbers
We John Cade so termed of our supposed father
Aside  Or rather of stealing a cade of herrings
For our enemies shall fall before us inspired with
the spirit of putting down kings and princes

Aside  No question of that for I have seen him
whipped three marketdays together
I fear neither sword nor fire

fire being burnt i the hand for stealing of sheep
Be brave then for your captain is brave and vows

apparel them all in one livery that they may agree
like brothers and worship me their lord
The first thing we do lets kill all the lawyers
Nay that I mean to do Is not this a lamentable
thing that of the skin of an innocent lamb should

But angry wrathful and inclined to blood
If you go forward therefore yield or die
As for these silkencoated slaves I pass not
It is to you good people that I speak
Over whom in time to come I hope to reign
For I am rightful heir unto the crown
Villain thy father was a plasterer

And Adam was a gardener
And what of that
Marry this Edmund Mortimer Earl of March
Married the Duke of Clarence daughter did he not
Ay sir
By her he had two children at one birth
Thats false
Ay theres the question but I say tis true
The elder of them being put to nurse
Was by a beggarwoman stolen away
And ignorant of his birth and parentage
Became a bricklayer when he came to age
His son am I deny it if you can
Nay tis too true therefore he shall be king
Sir he made a chimney in my fathers house and
the bricks are alive at this day to testify it
therefore deny it not
And will you credit this base drudges words

fathers sake Henry the Fifth in whose time boys
went to spancounter for French crowns I am content

And furthermore well have the Lord Says head for
selling the dukedom of Maine
And good reason for thereby is England mained and
fain to go with a staff but that my puissance holds
it up Fellow kings I tell you that that Lord Say
hath gelded the commonwealth and made it an eunuch
and more than that he can speak French and
therefore he is a traitor
O gross and miserable ignorance
Nay answer if you can the Frenchmen are our
enemies go to then I ask but this can he that
speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
counsellor or no
No no and therefore well have his head
Well seeing gentle words will not prevail
Assail them with the army of the king
Herald away and throughout every town
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade
That those which fly before the battle ends
May even in their wives and childrens sight
Be hangd up for example at their doors
And you that be the kings friends follow me
Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY and soldiers
And you that love the commons follow me
Now show yourselves men tis for liberty
We will not leave one lord one gentleman
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon

As would but that they dare not take our parts
They are all in order and march toward us
But then are we in order when we are most
out of order Come march forward
Exeunt

one
I desire no more
And to speak truth thou deservest no less This
monument of the victory will I bear
Putting on SIR HUMPHREYS brigandine

gaols and let out the prisoners
Fear not that I warrant thee Come lets march
towards London
Exeunt
Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication and the QUEEN with SUFFOLKS head BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind
And makes it fearful and degenerate
Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep
But who can cease to weep and look on this
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast
But wheres the body that I should embrace
What answer makes your grace to the rebels
supplication
Ill send some holy bishop to entreat
For God forbid so many simple souls
Should perish by the sword And I myself
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short
Will parley with Jack Cade their general
But stay Ill read it over once again
Ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face
Ruled like a wandering planet over me
And could it not enforce them to relent
That were unworthy to behold the same
Lord Say Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head
Ay but I hope your highness shall have his
How now madam
Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolks death
I fear me love if that I had been dead
Thou wouldst not have mournd so much for me

Enter a Messenger
How now what news why comest thou in such haste
The rebels are in Southwark fly my lord
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer
Descended from the Duke of Clarence house
And calls your grace usurper openly
And vows to crown himself in Westminster
His army is a ragged multitude
Of hinds and peasants rude and merciless
Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brothers death
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed
All scholars lawyers courtiers gentlemen
They call false caterpillars and intend their death
O graceless men they know not what they do
My gracious lord return to Killingworth
Until a power be raised to put them down
Ah were the Duke of Suffolk now alive
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased
Lord Say the traitors hate thee
Therefore away with us to Killingworth
So might your graces person be in danger
The sight of me is odious in their eyes
And therefore in this city will I stay
And live alone as secret as I may
Enter another Messenger
Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge
The citizens fly and forsake their houses
The rascal people thirsting after prey
Join with the traitor and they jointly swear
To spoil the city and your royal court
Then linger not my lord away take horse

My hope is gone now Suffolk is deceased
Farewell my lord trust not the Kentish rebels
Trust nobody for fear you be betrayd
The trust I have is in mine innocence
And therefore am I bold and resolute
Exeunt
Enter SCALES upon the Tower walking Then enter two or three Citizens below
How now is Jack Cade slain
No my lord nor likely to be slain for they have
won the bridge killing all those that withstand
them the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from
the Tower to defend the city from the rebels
Such aid as I can spare you shall command
But I am troubled here with them myself
The rebels have assayd to win the Tower
But get you to Smithfield and gather head
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe
Fight for your king your country and your lives
And so farewell for I must hence again
Exeunt
Enter CADE and the rest and strikes his staff on Londonstone

So sirs now go some and pull down the Savoy

Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth
Aside  Mass twill be sore law then for he was
thrust in the mouth with a spear and tis not whole
yet
Aside  Nay John it will be stinking law for his
breath stinks with eating toasted cheese
I have thought upon it it shall be so Away burn

the parliament of England
Aside  Then we are like to have biting statutes

And henceforward all things shall be in common
Enter a Messenger
My lord a prize a prize heres the Lord Say

one and twenty fifteens and one shilling to the
pound the last subsidy
Enter BEVIS with Lord SAY
Well he shall be beheaded for it ten times Ah
thou say thou serge nay thou buckram lord now
art thou within pointblank of our jurisdiction
regal What canst thou answer to my majesty for
giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu the
dauphin of France Be it known unto thee by these
presence even the presence of Lord Mortimer that I
am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such
filth as thou art Thou hast most traitorously
corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
grammar school and whereas before our forefathers
had no other books but the score and the tally thou
hast caused printing to be used and contrary to
the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a
papermill It will be proved to thy face that thou
hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
a verb and such abominable words as no Christian
ear can endure to hear Thou hast appointed
justices of peace to call poor men before them
about matters they were not able to answer
Moreover thou hast put them in prison and because
they could not read thou hast hanged them when
indeed only for that cause they have been most
worthy to live Thou dost ride in a footcloth dost thou not
What of that
Marry thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a
cloak when honester men than thou go in their hose
and doublets
And work in their shirt too as myself for example
that am a butcher
You men of Kent
What say you of Kent
Nothing but this tis bona terra mala gens
Away with him away with him he speaks Latin
Hear me but speak and bear me where you will
Kent in the Commentaries Caesar writ
Is termd the civilst place of this isle
Sweet is the country because full of riches
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity
I sold not Maine I lost not Normandy
Yet to recover them would lose my life
Justice with favour have I always done
Prayers and tears have moved me gifts could never
But to maintain the king the realm and you
Large gifts have I bestowd on learned clerks
Because my book preferrd me to the king
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven
Unless you be possessd with devilish spirits
You cannot but forbear to murder me
This tongue hath parleyd unto foreign kings
For your behoof
Tut when struckst thou one blow in the field
Great men have reaching hands oft have I struck
Those that I never saw and struck them dead
O monstrous coward what to come behind folks
These cheeks are pale for watching for your good
Give him a box o the ear and that will make em red again
Long sitting to determine poor mens causes
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases
Ye shall have a hempen caudle then and the help of hatchet
Why dost thou quiver man
The palsy and not fear provokes me
Nay he nods at us as who should say Ill be even
with you Ill see if his head will stand steadier
on a pole or no Take him away and behead him
Tell me wherein have I offended most
Have I affected wealth or honour speak
Are my chests filld up with extorted gold
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold
Whom have I injured that ye seek my death
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding
This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts
O let me live
Aside  I feel remorse in myself with his words
but Ill bridle it he shall die an it be but for
pleading so well for his life Away with him he
has a familiar under his tongue he speaks not o
Gods name Go take him away I say and strike
off his head presently and then break into his
soninlaws house Sir James Cromer and strike off
his head and bring them both upon two poles hither
It shall be done
Ah countrymen if when you make your prayers
God should be so obdurate as yourselves
How would it fare with your departed souls
And therefore yet relent and save my life
Away with him and do as I command ye
Exeunt some with Lord SAY
The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head
on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute there
shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me
her maidenhead ere they have it men shall hold of
me in capite and we charge and command that their
wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell
My lord when shall we go to Cheapside and take up
commodities upon our bills
Marry presently
O brave
Reenter one with the heads
But is not this braver Let them kiss one another
for they loved well when they were alive Now part
them again lest they consult about the giving up of
some more towns in France Soldiers defer the
spoil of the city until night for with these borne
before us instead of maces will we ride through

Exeunt
Alarum and retreat Enter CADE and all his rabblement
Up Fish Street down Saint Magnus Corner Kill
and knock down throw them into Thames
Sound a parley
What noise is this I hear Dare any be so bold to
sound retreat or parley when I command them kill
Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD attended
Ay here they be that dare and will disturb thee
Know Cade we come ambassadors from the king
Unto the commons whom thou hast misled
And here pronounce free pardon to them all
That will forsake thee and go home in peace
What say ye countrymen will ye relent
And yield to mercy whilst tis offerd you
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths
Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon
Fling up his cap and say God save his majesty
Who hateth him and honours not his father
Henry the Fifth that made all France to quake
Shake he his weapon at us and pass by
God save the king God save the king
What Buckingham and Clifford are ye so brave And
you base peasants do ye believe him will you
needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks
Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates
that you should leave me at the White Hart in
Southwark I thought ye would never have given out
these arms till you had recovered your ancient
freedom but you are all recreants and dastards
and delight to live in slavery to the nobility Let
them break your backs with burthens take your
houses over your heads ravish your wives and
daughters before your faces for me I will make
shift for one and so Gods curse light upon you
all
Well follow Cade well follow Cade
Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth
That thus you do exclaim youll go with him
Will he conduct you through the heart of France
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes
Alas he hath no home no place to fly to
Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil
Unless by robbing of your friends and us
Weret not a shame that whilst you live at jar
The fearful French whom you late vanquished
Should make a start oer seas and vanquish you
Methinks already in this civil broil
I see them lording it in London streets
Crying Villiago unto all they meet
Better ten thousand baseborn Cades miscarry
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchmans mercy
To France to France and get what you have lost
Spare England for it is your native coast
Henry hath money you are strong and manly
God on our side doubt not of victory
A Clifford a Clifford well follow the king and Clifford
Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
multitude The name of Henry the Fifth hales them
to an hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me
desolate I see them lay their heads together to
surprise me My sword make way for me for here is
no staying In despite of the devils and hell have
through the very middest of you and heavens and
honour be witness that no want of resolution in me
but only my followers base and ignominious
treasons makes me betake me to my heels
Exit
What is he fled Go some and follow him
And he that brings his head unto the king
Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward
Exeunt some of them
Follow me soldiers well devise a mean
To reconcile you all unto the king
Exeunt
Sound Trumpets Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET on the terrace
Was ever king that joyd an earthly throne
And could command no more content than I
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle
But I was made a king at nine months old
Was never subject longd to be a king
As I do long and wish to be a subject
Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD
Health and glad tidings to your majesty
Why Buckingham is the traitor Cade surprised
Or is he but retired to make him strong
Enter below multitudes with halters about their necks
He is fled my lord and all his powers do yield
And humbly thus with halters on their necks
Expect your highness doom of life or death
Then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise
Soldiers this day have you redeemed your lives
And showd how well you love your prince and country
Continue still in this so good a mind
And Henry though he be infortunate
Assure yourselves will never be unkind
And so with thanks and pardon to you all
I do dismiss you to your several countries
God save the king God save the king
Enter a Messenger
Please it your grace to be advertised
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland
And with a puissant and a mighty power
Of gallowglasses and stout kerns
Is marching hitherward in proud array
And still proclaimeth as he comes along
His arms are only to remove from thee
The Duke of Somerset whom he terms traitor
Thus stands my state twixt Cade and York distressd
Like to a ship that having scaped a tempest
Is straightway calmd and boarded with a pirate
But now is Cade driven back his men dispersed
And now is York in arms to second him
I pray thee Buckingham go and meet him
And ask him whats the reason of these arms
Tell him Ill send Duke Edmund to the Tower
And Somerset well commit thee thither
Until his army be dismissd from him
My lord
Ill yield myself to prison willingly
Or unto death to do my country good
In any case be not too rough in terms
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language
I will my lord and doubt not so to deal
As all things shall redound unto your good
Come wife lets in and learn to govern better
For yet may England curse my wretched reign
Flourish Exeunt
Enter CADE
Fie on ambition fie on myself that have a sword
and yet am ready to famish These five days have I
hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for
all the country is laid for me but now am I so
hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a
thousand years I could stay no longer Wherefore
on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden to
see if I can eat grass or pick a sallet another
while which is not amiss to cool a mans stomach
this hot weather And I think this word sallet
was born to do me good for many a time but for a
sallet my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
bill and many a time when I have been dry and
bravely marching it hath served me instead of a
quart pot to drink in and now the word sallet
must serve me to feed on
Enter IDEN
Lord who would live turmoiled in the court
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these
This small inheritance my father left me
Contenteth me and worth a monarchy
I seek not to wax great by others waning
Or gather wealth I care not with what envy
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate
Heres the lord of the soil come to seize me for a
stray for entering his feesimple without leave
Ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand
crowns of the king carrying my head to him but
Ill make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow
my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part
Why rude companion whatsoeer thou be
I know thee not why then should I betray thee
Ist not enough to break into my garden
And like a thief to come to rob my grounds
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms
Brave thee ay by the best blood that ever was
broached and beard thee too Look on me well I
have eat no meat these five days yet come thou and
thy five men and if I do not leave you all as dead
as a doornail I pray God I may never eat grass more
Nay it shall neer be said while England stands
That Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent
Took odds to combat a poor famishd man
Oppose thy steadfastgazing eyes to mine
See if thou canst outface me with thy looks
Set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
And if mine arm be heaved in the air
Thy grave is diggd already in the earth
As for words whose greatness answers words
Let this my sword report what speech forbears
By my valour the most complete champion that ever I
heard Steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out
the burlyboned clown in chines of beef ere thou
sleep in thy sheath I beseech God on my knees thou
mayst be turned to hobnails
Here they fight CADE falls
O I am slain famine and no other hath slain me
let ten thousand devils come against me and give me
but the ten meals I have lost and Ill defy them
all Wither garden and be henceforth a
buryingplace to all that do dwell in this house
because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled
Ist Cade that I have slain that monstrous traitor
Sword I will hollow thee for this thy deed
And hang thee oer my tomb when I am dead
Neer shall this blood be wiped from thy point
But thou shalt wear it as a heralds coat
To emblaze the honour that thy master got
Iden farewell and be proud of thy victory Tell
Kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort
all the world to be cowards for I that never
feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour
Dies
How much thou wrongst me heaven be my judge
Die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword
So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
And there cut off thy most ungracious head
Which I will bear in triumph to the king
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon
Exit
Enter YORK and his army of Irish with drum and colours
From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
And pluck the crown from feeble Henrys head
Ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright
To entertain great Englands lawful king
Ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear
Let them obey that know not how to rule
This hand was made to handle naught but gold
Except a sword or sceptre balance it
A sceptre shall it have have I a soul
On which Ill toss the flowerdeluce of France
Enter BUCKINGHAM
Whom have we here Buckingham to disturb me
The king hath sent him sure I must dissemble
York if thou meanest well I greet thee well
Humphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting
Art thou a messenger or come of pleasure
A messenger from Henry our dread liege
To know the reason of these arms in peace
Or why thou being a subject as I am
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
Should raise so great a power without his leave
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court
Aside  Scarce can I speak my choler is so great
O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint
I am so angry at these abject terms
And now like Ajax Telamonius
On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury
I am far better born than is the king
More like a king more kingly in my thoughts
But I must make fair weather yet a while
Till Henry be more weak and I more strong
Buckingham I prithee pardon me
That I have given no answer all this while
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy
The cause why I have brought this army hither
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king
Seditious to his grace and to the state
That is too much presumption on thy part
But if thy arms be to no other end
The king hath yielded unto thy demand
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower
Upon thine honour is he prisoner
Upon mine honour he is prisoner
Then Buckingham I do dismiss my powers
Soldiers I thank you all disperse yourselves
Meet me tomorrow in St Georges field
You shall have pay and every thing you wish
And let my sovereign virtuous Henry
Command my eldest son nay all my sons
As pledges of my fealty and love
Ill send them all as willing as I live
Lands goods horse armour any thing I have
Is his to use so Somerset may die
York I commend this kind submission
We twain will go into his highness tent
Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants
Buckingham doth York intend no harm to us
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm
In all submission and humility
York doth present himself unto your highness
Then what intends these forces thou dost bring
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade
Who since I heard to be discomfited
Enter IDEN with CADES head
If one so rude and of so mean condition
May pass into the presence of a king
Lo I present your grace a traitors head
The head of Cade whom I in combat slew
The head of Cade Great God how just art Thou
O let me view his visage being dead
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble
Tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him
I was ant like your majesty
How art thou calld and what is thy degree
Alexander Iden thats my name
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king
So please it you my lord twere not amiss
He were created knight for his good service
Iden kneel down
He kneels
Rise up a knight
We give thee for reward a thousand marks
And will that thou henceforth attend on us
May Iden live to merit such a bounty
And never live but true unto his liege
Rises
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET
See Buckingham Somerset comes with the queen
Go bid her hide him quickly from the duke
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head
But boldly stand and front him to his face
How now is Somerset at liberty
Then York unloose thy longimprisond thoughts
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset
False king why hast thou broken faith with me
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse
King did I call thee no thou art not king
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes
Which darest not no nor canst not rule a traitor
That head of thine doth not become a crown
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmers staff
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine
Whose smile and frown like to Achilles spear
Is able with the change to kill and cure
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
Give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more
Oer him whom heaven created for thy ruler
O monstrous traitor I arrest thee York
Of capital treason gainst the king and crown
Obey audacious traitor kneel for grace
Wouldst have me kneel first let me ask of these
If they can brook I bow a knee to man
Sirrah call in my sons to be my bail
Exit Attendant
I know ere they will have me go to ward
Theyll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement
Call hither Clifford bid him come amain
To say if that the bastard boys of York
Shall be the surety for their traitor father
Exit BUCKINGHAM
O bloodbesotted Neapolitan
Outcast of Naples Englands bloody scourge
The sons of York thy betters in their birth
Shall be their fathers bail and bane to those
That for my surety will refuse the boys
Enter EDWARD and RICHARD
See where they come Ill warrant theyll
make it good
Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD
And here comes Clifford to deny their bail
Health and all happiness to my lord the king
Kneels
I thank thee Clifford say what news with thee
Nay do not fright us with an angry look
We are thy sovereign Clifford kneel again
For thy mistaking so we pardon thee
This is my king York I do not mistake
But thou mistakest me much to think I do
To Bedlam with him is the man grown mad
Ay Clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour
Makes him oppose himself against his king
He is a traitor let him to the Tower
He is arrested but will not obey
His sons he says shall give their words for him
Will you not sons
Ay noble father if our words will serve
And if words will not then our weapons shall
Why what a brood of traitors have we here
Look in a glass and call thy image so
I am thy king and thou a falseheart traitor
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears
That with the very shaking of their chains
They may astonish these felllurking curs
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me
Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY
Are these thy bears well bait thy bears to death
And manacle the bearward in their chains
If thou darest bring them to the baiting place
Oft have I seen a hot oerweening cur
Run back and bite because he was withheld
Who being sufferd with the bears fell paw
Hath clappd his tail between his legs and cried
And such a piece of service will you do
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick
Hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape
Nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon
Take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves
Why Warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
Old Salisbury shame to thy silver hair
Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son
What wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
O where is faith O where is loyalty
If it be banishd from the frosty head
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
And shame thine honourable age with blood
Why art thou old and wantst experience
Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
For shame in duty bend thy knee to me
That bows unto the grave with mickle age
My lord I have considerd with myself
The title of this most renowned duke
And in my conscience do repute his grace
The rightful heir to Englands royal seat
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
I have
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
It is great sin to swear unto a sin
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath
Who can be bound by any solemn vow
To do a murderous deed to rob a man
To force a spotless virgins chastity
To reave the orphan of his patrimony
To wring the widow from her customd right
And have no other reason for this wrong
But that he was bound by a solemn oath
A subtle traitor needs no sophister
Call Buckingham and bid him arm himself
Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast
I am resolved for death or dignity
The first I warrant thee if dreams prove true
You were best to go to bed and dream again
To keep thee from the tempest of the field
I am resolved to bear a greater storm
Than any thou canst conjure up today
And that Ill write upon thy burgonet
Might I but know thee by thy household badge
Now by my fathers badge old Nevils crest
The rampant bear chaind to the ragged staff
This day Ill wear aloft my burgonet
As on a mountain top the cedar shows
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
Even to affright thee with the view thereof
And from thy burgonet Ill rend thy bear
And tread it under foot with all contempt
Despite the bearward that protects the bear
And so to arms victorious father
To quell the rebels and their complices
Fie charity for shame speak not in spite
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight
Foul stigmatic thats more than thou canst tell
If not in heaven youll surely sup in hell
Exeunt severally
Alarums to the battle Enter WARWICK
Clifford of Cumberland tis Warwick calls
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear
Now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
And dead mens cries do fill the empty air
Clifford I say come forth and fight with me
Proud northern lord Clifford of Cumberland
Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms
Enter YORK
How now my noble lord what all afoot
The deadlyhanded Clifford slew my steed
But match to match I have encounterd him
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
Even of the bonny beast he loved so well
Enter CLIFFORD
Of one or both of us the time is come
Hold Warwick seek thee out some other chase
For I myself must hunt this deer to death
Then nobly York tis for a crown thou fightst
As I intend Clifford to thrive today
It grieves my soul to leave thee unassaild
Exit
What seest thou in me York why dost thou pause
With thy brave bearing should I be in love
But that thou art so fast mine enemy
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
But that tis shown ignobly and in treason
So let it help me now against thy sword
As I in justice and true right express it
A dreadful lay Address thee instantly
They fight and CLIFFORD falls
La fin couronne les oeuvres
Dies
Thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still
Peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will
Exit
Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
Shame and confusion all is on the rout
Fear frames disorder and disorder wounds
Where it should guard O war thou son of hell
Whom angry heavens do make their minister
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
Hot coals of vengeance Let no soldier fly
He that is truly dedicate to war
Hath no selflove nor he that loves himself
Hath not essentially but by circumstance
The name of valour
Seeing his dead father
O let the vile world end
And the premised flames of the last day
Knit earth and heaven together
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast
Particularities and petty sounds
To cease Wast thou ordaind dear father
To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
The silver livery of advised age
And in thy reverence and thy chairdays thus
To die in ruffian battle Even at this sight
My heart is turnd to stone and while tis mine
It shall be stony York not our old men spares
No more will I their babes tears virginal
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity
Meet I an infant of the house of York
Into as many gobbets will I cut it
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did
In cruelty will I seek out my fame
Come thou new ruin of old Cliffords house
As did AEneas old Anchises bear
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders
But then AEneas bare a living load
Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine
Exit bearing off his father
Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight SOMERSET is killed
So lie thou there
For underneath an alehouse paltry sign
The Castle in Saint Albans Somerset
Hath made the wizard famous in his death
Sword hold thy temper heart be wrathful still
Priests pray for enemies but princes kill
Exit
Fight excursions Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET and others
Away my lord you are slow for shame away
Can we outrun the heavens good Margaret stay
What are you made of youll nor fight nor fly
Now is it manhood wisdom and defence
To give the enemy way and to secure us
By what we can which can no more but fly
Alarum afar off
If you be taen we then should see the bottom
Of all our fortunes but if we haply scape
As well we may if not through your neglect
We shall to London get where you are loved
And where this breach now in our fortunes made
May readily be stoppd
Reenter YOUNG CLIFFORD
But that my hearts on future mischief set
I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly
But fly you must uncurable discomfit
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts
Away for your relief and we will live
To see their day and them our fortune give
Away my lord away
Exeunt
Alarum Retreat Enter YORK RICHARD WARWICK and Soldiers with drum and colours
Of Salisbury who can report of him
That winter lion who in rage forgets
Aged contusions and all brush of time
And like a gallant in the brow of youth
Repairs him with occasion This happy day
Is not itself nor have we won one foot
If Salisbury be lost
My noble father
Three times today I holp him to his horse
Three times bestrid him thrice I led him off
But still where danger was still there I met him
And like rich hangings in a homely house
So was his will in his old feeble body
But noble as he is look where he comes
Enter SALISBURY
Now by my sword well hast thou fought today
By the mass so did we all I thank you Richard
God knows how long it is I have to live
And it hath pleased him that three times today
You have defended me from imminent death
Well lords we have not got that which we have
Tis not enough our foes are this time fled
Being opposites of such repairing nature
I know our safety is to follow them
For as I hear the king is fled to London
To call a present court of parliament
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth
What says Lord Warwick shall we after them
After them nay before them if we can
Now by my faith lords twas a glorious day
Saint Albans battle won by famous York
Shall be eternized in all age to come
Sound drums and trumpets and to London all
And more such days as these to us befall
Exeunt
Alarum Enter YORK EDWARD RICHARD NORFOLK MONTAGUE WARWICK and Soldiers
I wonder how the king escaped our hands
While we pursued the horsemen of the north
He slily stole away and left his men
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
Cheerd up the drooping army and himself
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast
Charged our main battles front and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain
Lord Staffords father Duke of Buckingham
Is either slain or wounded dangerously
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow
That this is true father behold his blood
And brother heres the Earl of Wiltshires blood
Whom I encounterd as the battles joind
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did
Throwing down SOMERSETs head
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons
But is your grace dead my Lord of Somerset
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt
Thus do I hope to shake King Henrys head
And so do I Victorious Prince of York
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
This is the palace of the fearful king
And this the regal seat possess it York
For this is thine and not King Henrys heirs
Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will
For hither we have broken in by force
Well all assist you he that flies shall die
Thanks gentle Norfolk stay by me my lords
And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night
They go up
And when the king comes offer no violence
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
The queen this day here holds her parliament
But little thinks we shall be of her council
By words or blows here let us win our right
Armd as we are lets stay within this house
The bloody parliament shall this be calld
Unless Plantagenet Duke of York be king
And bashful Henry deposed whose cowardice
Hath made us bywords to our enemies
Then leave me not my lords be resolute
I mean to take possession of my right
Neither the king nor he that loves him best
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster
Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells
Ill plant Plantagenet root him up who dares
Resolve thee Richard claim the English crown
Flourish Enter KING HENRY VI CLIFFORD NORTHUMBERLAND WESTMORELAND EXETER and the rest
My lords look where the sturdy rebel sits
Even in the chair of state belike he means
Backd by the power of Warwick that false peer
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king
Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father
And thine Lord Clifford and you both have vowd revenge
On him his sons his favourites and his friends
If I be not heavens be revenged on me
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel
What shall we suffer this lets pluck him down
My heart for anger burns I cannot brook it
Be patient gentle Earl of Westmoreland
Patience is for poltroons such as he
He durst not sit there had your father lived
My gracious lord here in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York
Well hast thou spoken cousin be it so
Ah know you not the city favours them
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck
But when the duke is slain theyll quickly fly
Far be the thought of this from Henrys heart
To make a shambles of the parliamenthouse
Cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet
I am thy sovereign
I am thine
For shame come down he made thee Duke of York
Twas my inheritance as the earldom was
Thy father was a traitor to the crown
Exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry
Whom should he follow but his natural king
True Clifford and thats Richard Duke of York
And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne
It must and shall be so content thyself
Be Duke of Lancaster let him be king
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain
And Warwick shall disprove it You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers and with colours spread
Marchd through the city to the palace gates
Yes Warwick I remember it to my grief
And by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it
Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
Thy kinsman and thy friends Ill have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my fathers veins
Urge it no more lest that instead of words
I send thee Warwick such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir
Poor Clifford how I scorn his worthless threats
Will you we show our title to the crown
If not our swords shall plead it in the field
What title hast thou traitor to the crown
Thy father was as thou art Duke of York
Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March
I am the son of Henry the Fifth
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces
Talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all
The lord protector lost it and not I
When I was crownd I was but nine months old
You are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
Father tear the crown from the usurpers head
Sweet father do so set it on your head
Good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms
Lets fight it out and not stand cavilling thus
Sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly
Sons peace
Peace thou and give King Henry leave to speak
Plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords
And be you silent and attentive too
For he that interrupts him shall not live
Thinkst thou that I will leave my kingly throne
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat
No first shall war unpeople this my realm
Ay and their colours often borne in France
And now in England to our hearts great sorrow
Shall be my windingsheet Why faint you lords
My titles good and better far than his
Prove it Henry and thou shalt be king
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown
Twas by rebellion against his king
Aside  I know not what to say my titles weak
Tell me may not a king adopt an heir
What then
An if he may then am I lawful king
For Richard in the view of many lords
Resignd the crown to Henry the Fourth
Whose heir my father was and I am his
He rose against him being his sovereign
And made him to resign his crown perforce
Suppose my lords he did it unconstraind
Think you twere prejudicial to his crown
No for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign
Art thou against us Duke of Exeter
His is the right and therefore pardon me
Why whisper you my lords and answer not
My conscience tells me he is lawful king
Aside  All will revolt from me and turn to him
Plantagenet for all the claim thou layst
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed
Deposed he shall be in despite of all
Thou art deceived tis not thy southern power
Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
Can set the duke up in despite of me
King Henry be thy title right or wrong
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence
May that ground gape and swallow me alive
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father
O Clifford how thy words revive my heart
Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown
What mutter you or what conspire you lords
Do right unto this princely Duke of York
Or I will fill the house with armed men
And over the chair of state where now he sits
Write up his title with usurping blood
He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves
My Lord of Warwick hear me but one word
Let me for this my lifetime reign as king
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest
I am content Richard Plantagenet
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease
What wrong is this unto the prince your son
What good is this to England and himself
Base fearful and despairing Henry
How hast thou injured both thyself and us
I cannot stay to hear these articles
Nor I
Come cousin let us tell the queen these news
Farewell fainthearted and degenerate king
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides
Be thou a prey unto the house of York
And die in bands for this unmanly deed
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
Or live in peace abandond and despised
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND CLIFFORD and WESTMORELAND
Turn this way Henry and regard them not
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield
Ah Exeter
Why should you sigh my lord
Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit
But be it as it may I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
Conditionally that here thou take an oath
To cease this civil war and whilst I live
To honour me as thy king and sovereign
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself
This oath I willingly take and will perform
Long live King Henry Plantagenet embrace him
And long live thou and these thy forward sons
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes
Sennet Here they come down
Farewell my gracious lord Ill to my castle
And Ill keep London with my soldiers
And I to Norfolk with my followers
And I unto the sea from whence I came
Exeunt YORK EDWARD EDMUND GEORGE RICHARD  WARWICK NORFOLK MONTAGUE their Soldiers and Attendants
And I with grief and sorrow to the court
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
Here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger
Ill steal away
Exeter so will I
Nay go not from me I will follow thee
Be patient gentle queen and I will stay
Who can be patient in such extremes
Ah wretched man would I had died a maid
And never seen thee never borne thee son
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I
Or felt that pain which I did for him once
Or nourishd him as I did with my blood
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son
Father you cannot disinherit me
If you be king why should not I succeed
Pardon me Margaret pardon me sweet son
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me
Enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced
I shame to hear thee speak Ah timorous wretch
Thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
And given unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown
What is it but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas
The duke is made protector of the realm
And yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves
Had I been there which am a silly woman
The soldiers should have tossd me on their pikes
But thou preferrst thy life before thine honour
And seeing thou dost I here divorce myself
Both from thy table Henry and thy bed
Whereby my son is disinherited
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine if once they see them spread
And spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the house of York
Thus do I leave thee Come son lets away
Our army is ready come well after them
Stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak
Thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone
Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me
Ay to be murderd by his enemies
When I return with victory from the field
Ill see your grace till then Ill follow her
Come son away we may not linger thus
Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
Poor queen how love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke
Whose haughty spirit winged with desire
Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son
The loss of those three lords torments my heart
Ill write unto them and entreat them fair
Come cousin you shall be the messenger
And I I hope shall reconcile them all
Exeunt
Enter RICHARD EDWARD and MONTAGUE
Brother though I be youngest give me leave
No I can better play the orator
But I have reasons strong and forcible
Enter YORK
Why how now sons and brother at a strife
What is your quarrel how began it first
No quarrel but a slight contention
About what
About that which concerns your grace and us
The crown of England father which is yours
Mine boy not till King Henry be dead
Your right depends not on his life or death
Now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe
It will outrun you father in the end
I took an oath that he should quietly reign
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
No God forbid your grace should be forsworn
I shall be if I claim by open war
Ill prove the contrary if youll hear me speak
Thou canst not son it is impossible
An oath is of no moment being not took
Before a true and lawful magistrate
That hath authority over him that swears
Henry had none but did usurp the place
Then seeing twas he that made you to depose
Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
Therefore to arms And father do but think
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy
Why do we finger thus I cannot rest
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henrys heart
Richard enough I will be king or die
Brother thou shalt to London presently
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise
Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk
And tell him privily of our intent
You Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise
In them I trust for they are soldiers
Witty courteous liberal full of spirit
While you are thus employd what resteth more
But that I seek occasion how to rise
And yet the king not privy to my drift
Nor any of the house of Lancaster
Enter a Messenger
But stay what news Why comest thou in such post
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle
She is hard by with twenty thousand men
And therefore fortify your hold my lord
Ay with my sword What thinkst thou that we fear them
Edward and Richard you shall stay with me
My brother Montague shall post to London
Let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest
Whom we have left protectors of the king
With powerful policy strengthen themselves
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths
Brother I go Ill win them fear it not
And thus most humbly I do take my leave
Exit
Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour
The army of the queen mean to besiege us
She shall not need well meet her in the field
What with five thousand men
Ay with five hundred father for a need
A womans general what should we fear
A march afar off
I hear their drums lets set our men in order
And issue forth and bid them battle straight
Five men to twenty though the odds be great
I doubt not uncle of our victory
Many a battle have I won in France
When as the enemy hath been ten to one
Why should I not now have the like success
Alarum Exeunt
Alarums Enter RUTLAND and his Tutor
Ah whither shall I fly to scape their hands
Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes
Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers
Chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life
As for the brat of this accursed duke
Whose father slew my father he shall die
And I my lord will bear him company
Soldiers away with him
Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child
Lest thou be hated both of God and man
Exit dragged off by Soldiers
How now is he dead already or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes Ill open them
So looks the pentup lion oer the wretch
That trembles under his devouring paws
And so he walks insulting oer his prey
And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword
And not with such a cruel threatening look
Sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath
Be thou revenged on men and let me live
In vain thou speakst poor boy my fathers blood
Hath stoppd the passage where thy words should enter
Then let my fathers blood open it again
He is a man and Clifford cope with him
Had thy brethren here their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me
No if I diggd up thy forefathers graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains
It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
The sight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive I live in hell
Therefore
Lifting his hand
O let me pray before I take my death
To thee I pray sweet Clifford pity me
Such pity as my rapiers point affords
I never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
Thy father hath
But twas ere I was born
Thou hast one son for his sake pity me
Lest in revenge thereof sith God is just
He be as miserably slain as I
Ah let me live in prison all my days
And when I give occasion of offence
Then let me die for now thou hast no cause
No cause
Thy father slew my father therefore die
Stabs him
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae
Dies
Plantagenet I come Plantagenet
And this thy sons blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
Congeald with this do make me wipe off both
Exit
Alarum Enter YORK
The army of the queen hath got the field
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly like ships before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves
My sons God knows what hath bechanced them
But this I know they have demeand themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death
Three times did Richard make a lane to me
And thrice cried Courage father fight it out
And full as oft came Edward to my side
With purple falchion painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encounterd him
And when the hardiest warriors did retire
Richard cried Charge and give no foot of ground
And cried A crown or else a glorious tomb
A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre
With this we charged again but out alas
We bodged again as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with overmatching waves
A short alarum within
Ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury
And were I strong I would not shun their fury
The sands are numberd that make up my life
Here must I stay and here my life must end
Enter QUEEN MARGARET CLIFFORD NORTHUMBERLAND PRINCE EDWARD and Soldiers
Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage
I am your butt and I abide your shot
Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet
Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
With downright payment showd unto my father
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car
And made an evening at the noontide prick
My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven
Scorning whateer you can afflict me with
Why come you not what multitudes and fear
So cowards fight when they can fly no further
So doves do peck the falcons piercing talons
So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
Breathe out invectives gainst the officers
O Clifford but bethink thee once again
And in thy thought oerrun my former time
And if though canst for blushing view this face
And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
I will not bandy with thee word for word
But buckle with thee blows twice two for one
Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitors life
Wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland
Hold Clifford do not honour him so much
To prick thy finger though to wound his heart
What valour were it when a cur doth grin
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth
When he might spurn him with his foot away
It is wars prize to take all vantages
And ten to one is no impeach of valour
They lay hands on YORK who struggles
Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
So doth the cony struggle in the net
So triumph thieves upon their conquerd booty
So true men yield with robbers so oermatchd
What would your grace have done unto him now
Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland
Come make him stand upon this molehill here
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand
What was it you that would be Englands king
Wast you that revelld in our parliament
And made a preachment of your high descent
Where are your mess of sons to back you now
The wanton Edward and the lusty George
And wheres that valiant crookback prodigy
Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland
Look York I staind this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford with his rapiers point
Made issue from the bosom of the boy
And if thine eyes can water for his death
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly
I should lament thy miserable state
I prithee grieve to make me merry York
What hath thy fiery heart so parchd thine entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutlands death
Why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus
Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance
Thou wouldst be feed I see to make me sport
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown
A crown for York and lords bow low to him
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on
Putting a paper crown on his head
Ay marry sir now looks he like a king
Ay this is he that took King Henrys chair
And this is he was his adopted heir
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crownd so soon and broke his solemn oath
As I bethink me you should not be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death
And will you pale your head in Henrys glory
And rob his temples of the diadem
Now in his life against your holy oath
O tis a fault too too unpardonable
Off with the crown and with the crown his head
And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
That is my office for my fathers sake
Nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes
Shewolf of France but worse than wolves of France
Whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth
How illbeseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph like an Amazonian trull
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates
But that thy face is vizardlike unchanging
Made impudent with use of evil deeds
I would assay proud queen to make thee blush
To tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived
Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
Unless the adage must be verified
That beggars mounted run their horse to death
Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
But God he knows thy share thereof is small
Tis virtue that doth make them most admired
The contrary doth make thee wonderd at
Tis government that makes them seem divine
The want thereof makes thee abominable
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us
Or as the south to the septentrion
O tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide
How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal
And yet be seen to bear a womans face
Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
Bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish
Wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will
For raging wind blows up incessant showers
And when the rage allays the rain begins
These tears are my sweet Rutlands obsequies
And every drop cries vengeance for his death
Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false
Frenchwoman
Beshrew me but his passion moves me so
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears
That face of his the hungry cannibals
Would not have touchd would not have staind with blood
But you are more inhuman more inexorable
O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania
See ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears
This cloth thou dipdst in blood of my sweet boy
And I with tears do wash the blood away
Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
And if thou tellst the heavy story right
Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
Yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears
And say Alas it was a piteous deed
There take the crown and with the crown my curse
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand
Hardhearted Clifford take me from the world
My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
Had he been slaughterman to all my kin
I should not for my life but weep with him
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
What weepingripe my Lord Northumberland
Think but upon the wrong he did us all
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears
Heres for my oath heres for my fathers death
Stabbing him
And heres to right our gentlehearted king
Stabbing him
Open Thy gate of mercy gracious God
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee
Dies
Off with his head and set it on York gates
So York may overlook the town of York
Flourish Exeunt
A march Enter EDWARD RICHARD and their power
I wonder how our princely father scaped
Or whether he be scaped away or no
From Cliffords and Northumberlands pursuit
Had he been taen we should have heard the news
Had he been slain we should have heard the news
Or had he scaped methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape
How fares my brother why is he so sad
I cannot joy until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father is become
I saw him in the battle range about
And watchd him how he singled Clifford forth
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat
Or as a bear encompassd round with dogs
Who having pinchd a few and made them cry
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him
So fared our father with his enemies
So fled his enemies my warlike father
Methinks tis prize enough to be his son
See how the morning opes her golden gates
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun
How well resembles it the prime of youth
Trimmd like a younker prancing to his love
Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns
Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
Not separated with the racking clouds
But severd in a pale clearshining sky
See see they join embrace and seem to kiss
As if they vowd some league inviolable
Now are they but one lamp one light one sun
In this the heaven figures some event
Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
I think it cites us brother to the field
That we the sons of brave Plantagenet
Each one already blazing by our meeds
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
And overshine the earth as this the world
Whateer it bodes henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fairshining suns
Nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it
You love the breeder better than the male
Enter a Messenger
But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
Ah one that was a woful lookeron
When as the noble Duke of York was slain
Your princely father and my loving lord
O speak no more for I have heard too much
Say how he died for I will hear it all
Environed he was with many foes
And stood against them as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks that would have enterd Troy
But Hercules himself must yield to odds
And many strokes though with a little axe
Hew down and fell the hardesttimberd oak
By many hands your father was subdued
But only slaughterd by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen
Who crownd the gracious duke in high despite
Laughd in his face and when with grief he wept
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain
And after many scorns many foul taunts
They took his head and on the gates of York
They set the same and there it doth remain
The saddest spectacle that eer I viewd
Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon
Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
O Clifford boisterous Clifford thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry
And treacherously hast thou vanquishd him
For hand to hand he would have vanquishd thee
Now my souls palace is become a prison
Ah would she break from hence that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest
For never henceforth shall I joy again
Never O never shall I see more joy
I cannot weep for all my bodys moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart
Nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench
To weep is to make less the depth of grief
Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
Richard I bear thy name Ill venge thy death
Or die renowned by attempting it
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee
His dukedom and his chair with me is left
Nay if thou be that princely eagles bird
Show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun
For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
Either that is thine or else thou wert not his
March Enter WARWICK MONTAGUE and their army
How now fair lords What fare what news abroad
Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount
Our baleful news and at each words deliverance
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
The words would add more anguish than the wounds
O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain
O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet
Which held three dearly as his souls redemption
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death
Ten days ago I drownd these news in tears
And now to add more measure to your woes
I come to tell you things sith then befalln
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp
Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
Were brought me of your loss and his depart
I then in London keeper of the king
Musterd my soldiers gatherd flocks of friends
And very well appointed as I thought
Marchd toward Saint Albans to intercept the queen
Bearing the king in my behalf along
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Touching King Henrys oath and your succession
Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met
Our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought
But whether twas the coldness of the king
Who lookd full gently on his warlike queen
That robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen
Or whether twas report of her success
Or more than common fear of Cliffords rigour
Who thunders to his captives blood and death
I cannot judge but to conclude with truth
Their weapons like to lightning came and went
Our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight
Or like an idle thresher with a flail
Fell gently down as if they struck their friends
I cheerd them up with justice of our cause
With promise of high pay and great rewards
But all in vain they had no heart to fight
And we in them no hope to win the day
So that we fled the king unto the queen
Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself
In haste posthaste are come to join with you
For in the marches here we heard you were
Making another head to fight again
Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick
And when came George from Burgundy to England
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
And for your brother he was lately sent
From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy
With aid of soldiers to this needful war
Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit
But neer till now his scandal of retire
Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henrys head
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness peace and prayer
I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not
Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak
But in this troublous time whats to be done
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
Numbering our AveMaries with our beads
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms
If for the last say ay and to it lords
Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out
And therefore comes my brother Montague
Attend me lords The proud insulting queen
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland
And of their feather many more proud birds
Have wrought the easymelting king like wax
He swore consent to your succession
His oath enrolled in the parliament
And now to London all the crew are gone
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster
Their power I think is thirty thousand strong
Now if the help of Norfolk and myself
With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand
Why Via to London will we march amain
And once again bestride our foaming steeds
And once again cry Charge upon our foes
But never once again turn back and fly
Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak
Neer may he live to see a sunshine day
That cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay
Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean
And when thou failstas God forbid the hour
Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend
No longer Earl of March but Duke of York
The next degree is Englands royal throne
For King of England shalt thou be proclaimd
In every borough as we pass along
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
King Edward valiant Richard Montague
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown
But sound the trumpets and about our task
Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine
Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us
Enter a Messenger
How now what news
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
The queen is coming with a puissant host
And craves your company for speedy counsel
Why then it sorts brave warriors lets away
Exeunt
Flourish Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET  PRINCE EDWARD CLIFFORD and NORTHUMBERLAND with drum and trumpets
Welcome my lord to this brave town of York
Yonders the head of that archenemy
That sought to be encompassd with your crown
Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
To see this sight it irks my very soul
Withhold revenge dear God tis not my fault
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow
My gracious liege this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks
Not to the beast that would usurp their den
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
Not his that spoils her young before her face
Who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting
Not he that sets his foot upon her back
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
He but a duke would have his son a king
And raise his issue like a loving sire
Thou being a king blest with a goodly son
Didst yield consent to disinherit him
Which argued thee a most unloving father
Unreasonable creatures feed their young
And though mans face be fearful to their eyes
Yet in protection of their tender ones
Who hath not seen them even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight
Make war with him that climbd unto their nest
Offer their own lives in their youngs defence
For shame my liege make them your precedent
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his fathers fault
And long hereafter say unto his child
What my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away
Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy
And let his manly face which promiseth
Successful fortune steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him
Full well hath Clifford playd the orator
Inferring arguments of mighty force
But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear
That things illgot had ever bad success
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell
Ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
And would my father had left me no more
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousandfold more care to keep
Than in possession and jot of pleasure
Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here
My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
And this soft courage makes your followers faint
You promised knighthood to our forward son
Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
Edward kneel down
Edward Plantagenet arise a knight
And learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
My gracious father by your kingly leave
Ill draw it as apparent to the crown
And in that quarrel use it to the death
Why that is spoken like a toward prince
Enter a Messenger
Royal commanders be in readiness
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York
And in the towns as they do march along
Proclaims him king and many fly to him
Darraign your battle for they are at hand
I would your highness would depart the field
The queen hath best success when you are absent
Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
Why thats my fortune too therefore Ill stay
Be it with resolution then to fight
My royal father cheer these noble lords
And hearten those that fight in your defence
Unsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George
March Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD WARWICK NORFOLK MONTAGUE and Soldiers
Now perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for grace
And set thy diadem upon my head
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field
Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
I am his king and he should bow his knee
I was adopted heir by his consent
Since when his oath is broke for as I hear
You that are king though he do wear the crown
To blot out me and put his own son in
And reason too
Who should succeed the father but the son
Are you there butcher O I cannot speak
Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee
Or any he the proudest of thy sort
Twas you that killd young Rutland was it not
Ay and old York and yet not satisfied
For Gods sake lords give signal to the fight
What sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown
Why how now longtongued Warwick dare you speak
When you and I met at Saint Albans last
Your legs did better service than your hands
Then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine
You said so much before and yet you fled
Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence
No nor your manhood that durst make you stay
Northumberland I hold thee reverently
Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my bigswoln heart
Upon that Clifford that cruel childkiller
I slew thy father callst thou him a child
Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland
But ere sunset Ill make thee curse the deed
Have done with words my lords and hear me speak
Defy them then or else hold close thy lips
I prithee give no limits to my tongue
I am a king and privileged to speak
My liege the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words therefore be still
Then executioner unsheathe thy sword
By him that made us all I am resolved
that Cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue
Say Henry shall I have my right or no
A thousand men have broke their fasts today
That neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown
If thou deny their blood upon thy head
For York in justice puts his armour on
If that be right which Warwick says is right
There is no wrong but every thing is right
Whoever got thee there thy mother stands
For well I wot thou hast thy mothers tongue
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic
Markd by the destinies to be avoided
As venom toads or lizards dreadful stings
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt
Whose father bears the title of a king
As if a channel should be calld the sea
Shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
To make this shameless callet know herself
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou
Although thy husband may be Menelaus
And neer was Agamemnons brother wrongd
By that false woman as this king by thee
His father revelld in the heart of France
And tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop
And had he matchd according to his state
He might have kept that glory to this day
But when he took a beggar to his bed
And graced thy poor sire with his bridalday
Even then that sunshine brewd a shower for him
That washd his fathers fortunes forth of France
And heapd sedition on his crown at home
For what hath broachd this tumult but thy pride
Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
And we in pity of the gentle king
Had slippd our claim until another age
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
And that thy summer bred us no increase
We set the axe to thy usurping root
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves
Yet know thou since we have begun to strike
Well never leave till we have hewn thee down
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods
And in this resolution I defy thee
Not willing any longer conference
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
Sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
And either victory or else a grave
Stay Edward
No wrangling woman well no longer stay
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day
Exeunt
Yorkshire
Alarum Excursions Enter WARWICK
Forspent with toil as runners with a race
I lay me down a little while to breathe
For strokes received and many blows repaid
Have robbd my strongknit sinews of their strength
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile
Enter EDWARD running
Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
For this world frowns and Edwards sun is clouded
How now my lord what hap what hope of good
Enter GEORGE
Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair
Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
What counsel give you whither shall we fly
Bootless is flight they follow us with wings
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
Enter RICHARD
Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
Thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
Broachd with the steely point of Cliffords lance
And in the very pangs of death he cried
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far
Warwick revenge brother revenge my death
So underneath the belly of their steeds
That staind their fetlocks in his smoking blood
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood
Ill kill my horse because I will not fly
Why stand we like softhearted women here
Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
And look upon as if the tragedy
Here on my knee I vow to God above
Ill never pause again never stand still
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
Or fortune given me measure of revenge
O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine
And ere my knee rise from the earths cold face
I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings
Beseeching thee if with they will it stands
That to my foes this body must be prey
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul
Now lords take leave until we meet again
Whereer it be in heaven or in earth
Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms
I that did never weep now melt with woe
That winter should cut off our springtime so
Away away Once more sweet lords farewell
Yet let us all together to our troops
And give them leave to fly that will not stay
And call them pillars that will stand to us
And if we thrive promise them such rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts
For yet is hope of life and victory
Forslow no longer make we hence amain
Exeunt
Excursions Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD
Now Clifford I have singled thee alone
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York
And this for Rutland both bound to revenge
Wert thou environd with a brazen wall
Now Richard I am with thee here alone
This is the hand that stabbd thy father York
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland
And heres the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself
And so have at thee
They fight WARWICK comes CLIFFORD flies
Nay Warwick single out some other chase
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death
Exeunt
Alarum Enter KING HENRY VI alone
This battle fares like to the mornings war
When dying clouds contend with growing light
What time the shepherd blowing of his nails
Can neither call it perfect day nor night
Now sways it this way like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind
Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind
Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
Now one the better then another best
Both tugging to be victors breast to breast
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered
So is the equal of this fell war
Here on this molehill will I sit me down
To whom God will there be the victory
For Margaret my queen and Clifford too
Have chid me from the battle swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence
Would I were dead if Gods good will were so
For what is in this world but grief and woe
O God methinks it were a happy life
To be no better than a homely swain
To sit upon a hill as I do now
To carve out dials quaintly point by point
Thereby to see the minutes how they run
How many make the hour full complete
How many hours bring about the day
How many days will finish up the year
How many years a mortal man may live
When this is known then to divide the times
So many hours must I tend my flock
So many hours must I take my rest
So many hours must I contemplate
So many hours must I sport myself
So many days my ewes have been with young
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece
So minutes hours days months and years
Passd over to the end they were created
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
Ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
Gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep
Than doth a rich embroiderd canopy
To kings that fear their subjects treachery
O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
And to conclude the shepherds homely curds
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
His wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys
Is far beyond a princes delicates
His viands sparkling in a golden cup
His body couched in a curious bed
When care mistrust and treason waits on him
Alarum Enter a Son that has killed his father dragging in the dead body
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody
This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
May be possessed with some store of crowns
And I that haply take them from him now
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
To some man else as this dead man doth me
Whos this O God it is my fathers face
Whom in this conflict I unwares have killd
O heavy times begetting such events
From London by the king was I pressd forth
My father being the Earl of Warwicks man
Came on the part of York pressd by his master
And I who at his hands received my life him
Have by my hands of life bereaved him
Pardon me God I knew not what I did
And pardon father for I knew not thee
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
And no more words till they have flowd their fill
O piteous spectacle O bloody times
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
Weep wretched man Ill aid thee tear for tear
And let our hearts and eyes like civil war
Be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief
Enter a Father that has killed his son bringing in the body
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
For I have bought it with an hundred blows
But let me see is this our foemans face
Ah no no no it is mine only son
Ah boy if any life be left in thee
Throw up thine eye see see what showers arise
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart
Upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart
O pity God this miserable age
What stratagems how fell how butcherly
Erroneous mutinous and unnatural
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget
O boy thy father gave thee life too soon
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late
Woe above woe grief more than common grief
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
O pity pity gentle heaven pity
The red rose and the white are on his face
The fatal colours of our striving houses
The one his purple blood right well resembles
The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
Wither one rose and let the other flourish
If you contend a thousand lives must wither
How will my mother for a fathers death
Take on with me and neer be satisfied
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears and neer be satisfied
How will the country for these woful chances
Misthink the king and not be satisfied
Was ever son so rued a fathers death
Was ever father so bemoand his son
Was ever king so grieved for subjects woe
Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
Ill bear thee hence where I may weep my fill
Exit with the body
These arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet
My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
For from my heart thine image neer shall go
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
And so obsequious will thy father be
Even for the loss of thee having no more
As Priam was for all his valiant sons
Ill bear thee hence and let them fight that will
For I have murdered where I should not kill
Exit with the body
Sadhearted men much overgone with care
Here sits a king more woful than you are
Alarums excursions Enter QUEEN MARGARET PRINCE EDWARD and EXETER
Fly father fly for all your friends are fled
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull
Away for death doth hold us in pursuit
Mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain
Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds
Having the fearful flying hare in sight
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
And bloody steel graspd in their ireful hands
Are at our backs and therefore hence amain
Away for vengeance comes along with them
Nay stay not to expostulate make speed
Or else come after Ill away before
Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter
Not that I fear to stay but love to go
Whither the queen intends Forward away
Exeunt
A loud alarum Enter CLIFFORD wounded
Here burns my candle out ay here it dies
Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light
O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow
More than my bodys parting with my soul
My love and fear glued many friends to thee
And now I fall thy tough commixture melts
Impairing Henry strengthening misproud York
The common people swarm like summer flies
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun
And who shines now but Henrys enemies
O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds
Thy burning car never had scorchd the earth
And Henry hadst thou swayd as kings should do
Or as thy father and his father did
Giving no ground unto the house of York
They never then had sprung like summer flies
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
The foe is merciless and will not pity
For at their hands I have deserved no pity
The air hath got into my deadly wounds
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint
Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest
I stabbd your fathers bosoms split my breast
He faints
Alarum and retreat Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD MONTAGUE WARWICK and Soldiers
Now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
Some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen
That led calm Henry though he were a king
As doth a sail filld with a fretting gust
Command an argosy to stem the waves
But think you lords that Clifford fled with them
No tis impossible he should escape
For though before his face I speak the words
Your brother Richard markd him for the grave
And wheresoeer he is hes surely dead
CLIFFORD groans and dies
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
A deadly groan like life and deaths departing
See who it is and now the battles ended
If friend or foe let him be gently used
Revoke that doom of mercy for tis Clifford
Who not contented that he loppd the branch
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth
But set his murdering knife unto the root
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
I mean our princely father Duke of York
From off the gates of York fetch down the head
Your fathers head which Clifford placed there
Instead whereof let this supply the room
Measure for measure must be answered
Bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house
That nothing sung but death to us and ours
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
And his illboding tongue no more shall speak
I think his understanding is bereft
Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
Dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say
O would he did and so perhaps he doth
Tis but his policy to counterfeit
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he gave our father
If so thou thinkst vex him with eager words
Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
Clifford repent in bootless penitence
Clifford devise excuses for thy faults
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults
Thou didst love York and I am son to York
Thou pitiedst Rutland I will pity thee
Wheres Captain Margaret to fence you now
They mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wont
What not an oath nay then the world goes hard
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
I know by that hes dead and by my soul
If this right hand would buy two hours life
That I in all despite might rail at him
This hand should chop it off and with the
issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy
Ay but hes dead off with the traitors head
And rear it in the place your fathers stands
And now to London with triumphant march
There to be crowned Englands royal king
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together
And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread
The scatterd foe that hopes to rise again
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
First will I see the coronation
And then to Brittany Ill cross the sea
To effect this marriage so it please my lord
Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester
And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester
For Gloucesters dukedom is too ominous
Tut thats a foolish observation
Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London
To see these honours in possession
Exeunt
Enter two Keepers with crossbows in their hands
Under this thickgrown brake well shroud ourselves
For through this laund anon the deer will come
And in this covert will we make our stand
Culling the principal of all the deer
Ill stay above the hill so both may shoot
That cannot be the noise of thy crossbow
Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
Here stand we both and aim we at the best
And for the time shall not seem tedious
Ill tell thee what befell me on a day
In this selfplace where now we mean to stand
Here comes a man lets stay till he be past
Enter KING HENRY VI disguised with a prayerbook
From Scotland am I stoln even of pure love
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight
No Harry Harry tis no land of thine
Thy place is filld thy sceptre wrung from thee
Thy balm washd off wherewith thou wast anointed
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now
No humble suitors press to speak for right
No not a man comes for redress of thee
For how can I help them and not myself
Ay heres a deer whose skins a keepers fee
This is the quondam king lets seize upon him
Let me embrace thee sour adversity
For wise men say it is the wisest course
Why linger we let us lay hands upon him
Forbear awhile well hear a little more
My queen and son are gone to France for aid
And as I hear the great commanding Warwick
Is thither gone to crave the French kings sister
To wife for Edward if this news be true
Poor queen and son your labour is but lost
For Warwick is a subtle orator
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words
By this account then Margaret may win him
For shes a woman to be pitied much
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
And Nero will be tainted with remorse
To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
Ay but shes come to beg Warwick to give
She on his left side craving aid for Henry
He on his right asking a wife for Edward
She weeps and says her Henry is deposed
He smiles and says his Edward is installd
That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength
And in conclusion wins the king from her
With promise of his sister and what else
To strengthen and support King Edwards place
O Margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
Art then forsaken as thou wentst forlorn
Say what art thou that talkst of kings and queens
More than I seem and less than I was born to
A man at least for less I should not be
And men may talk of kings and why not I
Ay but thou talkst as if thou wert a king
Why so I am in mind and thats enough
But if thou be a king where is thy crown
My crown is in my heart not on my head
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones
Nor to be seen my crown is called content
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
Well if you be a king crownd with content
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us for as we think
You are the king King Edward hath deposed
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy
But did you never swear and break an oath
No never such an oath nor will not now
Where did you dwell when I was King of England
Here in this country where we now remain
I was anointed king at nine months old
My father and my grandfather were kings
And you were sworn true subjects unto me
And tell me then have you not broke your oaths
No
For we were subjects but while you were king
Why am I dead do I not breathe a man
Ah simple men you know not what you swear
Look as I blow this feather from my face
And as the air blows it to me again
Obeying with my wind when I do blow
And yielding to another when it blows
Commanded always by the greater gust
Such is the lightness of you common men
But do not break your oaths for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
Go where you will the king shall be commanded
And be you kings command and Ill obey
We are true subjects to the king King Edward
So would you be again to Henry
If he were seated as King Edward is
We charge you in Gods name and the kings
To go with us unto the officers
In Gods name lead your kings name be obeyd
And what God will that let your king perform
And what he will I humbly yield unto
Exeunt
Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and LADY GREY
Brother of Gloucester at Saint Albans field
This ladys husband Sir Richard Grey was slain
His lands then seized on by the conqueror
Her suit is now to repossess those lands
Which we in justice cannot well deny
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit
It were dishonour to deny it her
It were no less but yet Ill make a pause
Aside to CLARENCE  Yea is it so
I see the lady hath a thing to grant
Before the king will grant her humble suit
Aside to GLOUCESTER  He knows the game how true
he keeps the wind
Aside to CLARENCE  Silence
Widow we will consider of your suit
And come some other time to know our mind
Right gracious lord I cannot brook delay
May it please your highness to resolve me now
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me
Aside to CLARENCE  Ay widow then Ill warrant
you all your lands
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you
Fight closer or good faith youll catch a blow
Aside to GLOUCESTER  I fear her not unless she
chance to fall
Aside to CLARENCE God forbid that for hell
take vantages
How many children hast thou widow tell me
Aside to GLOUCESTER  I think he means to beg a
child of her
Aside to CLARENCE  Nay whip me then hell rather
give her two
Three my most gracious lord
Aside to CLARENCE  You shall have four if youll
be ruled by him
Twere pity they should lose their fathers lands
Be pitiful dread lord and grant it then
Lords give us leave Ill try this widows wit
Aside to CLARENCE  Ay good leave have you for
you will have leave
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch
GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
Now tell me madam do you love your children
Ay full as dearly as I love myself
And would you not do much to do them good
To do them good I would sustain some harm
Then get your husbands lands to do them good
Therefore I came unto your majesty
Ill tell you how these lands are to be got
So shall you bind me to your highness service
What service wilt thou do me if I give them
What you command that rests in me to do
But you will take exceptions to my boon
No gracious lord except I cannot do it
Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask
Why then I will do what your grace commands
Aside to CLARENCE  He plies her hard and much rain
wears the marble
Aside to GLOUCESTER  As red as fire nay then
her wax must melt
Why stops my lord shall I not hear my task
An easy task tis but to love a king
Thats soon performd because I am a subject
Why then thy husbands lands I freely give thee
I take my leave with many thousand thanks
Aside to CLARENCE  The match is made she seals it
with a curtsy
But stay thee tis the fruits of love I mean
The fruits of love I mean my loving liege
Ay but I fear me in another sense
What love thinkst thou I sue so much to get
My love till death my humble thanks my prayers
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants
No by my troth I did not mean such love
Why then you mean not as I thought you did
But now you partly may perceive my mind
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your highness aims at if I aim aright
To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee
To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison
Why then thou shalt not have thy husbands lands
Why then mine honesty shall be my dower
For by that loss I will not purchase them
Therein thou wrongst thy children mightily
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me
But mighty lord this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit
Please you dismiss me either with ay or no
Ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
No if thou dost say no to my demand
Then no my lord My suit is at an end
Aside to CLARENCE  The widow likes him not she
knits her brows
Aside to GLOUCESTER  He is the bluntest wooer in
Christendom
Aside  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty
Her words do show her wit incomparable
All her perfections challenge sovereignty
One way or other she is for a king
And she shall be my love or else my queen
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen
Tis better said than done my gracious lord
I am a subject fit to jest withal
But far unfit to be a sovereign
Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends
And that is to enjoy thee for my love
And that is more than I will yield unto
I know I am too mean to be your queen
And yet too good to be your concubine
You cavil widow I did mean my queen
Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father
No more than when my daughters call thee mother
Thou art a widow and thou hast some children
And by Gods mother I being but a bachelor
Have other some why tis a happy thing
To be the father unto many sons
Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
Aside to CLARENCE  The ghostly father now hath done
his shrift
Aside to GLOUCESTER  When he was made a shriver
twas for shift
Brothers you muse what chat we two have had
The widow likes it not for she looks very sad
Youll think it strange if I should marry her
To whom my lord
Why Clarence to myself
That would be ten days wonder at the least
Thats a day longer than a wonder lasts
By so much is the wonder in extremes
Well jest on brothers I can tell you both
Her suit is granted for her husbands lands
Enter a Nobleman
My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate
See that he be conveyd unto the Tower
And go we brothers to the man that took him
To question of his apprehension
Widow go you along Lords use her honourably
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Ay Edward will use women honourably
Would he were wasted marrow bones and all
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
To cross me from the golden time I look for
And yet between my souls desire and me
The lustful Edwards title buried
Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward
And all the unlookd for issue of their bodies
To take their rooms ere I can place myself
A cold premeditation for my purpose
Why then I do but dream on sovereignty
Like one that stands upon a promontory
And spies a faroff shore where he would tread
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence
Saying hell lade it dry to have his way
So do I wish the crown being so far off
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it
And so I say Ill cut the causes off
Flattering me with impossibilities
My eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much
Unless my hand and strength could equal them
Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard
What other pleasure can the world afford
Ill make my heaven in a ladys lap
And deck my body in gay ornaments
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
O miserable thought and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
Why love forswore me in my  mothers womb
And for I should not deal in her soft laws
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
To shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub
To make an envious mountain on my back
Where sits deformity to mock my body
To shape my legs of an unequal size
To disproportion me in every part
Like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp
That carries no impression like the dam
And am I then a man to be beloved
O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
Then since this earth affords no joy to me
But to command to cheque to oerbear such
As are of better person than myself
Ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown
And whiles I live to account this world but hell
Until my misshaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown
And yet I know not how to get the crown
For many lives stand between me and home
And Ilike one lost in a thorny wood
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns
Seeking a way and straying from the way
Not knowing how to find the open air
But toiling desperately to find it out
Torment myself to catch the English crown
And from that torment I will free myself
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe
Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile
And cry Content to that which grieves my heart
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears
And frame my face to all occasions
Ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
Ill slay more gazers than the basilisk
Ill play the orator as well as Nestor
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could
And like a Sinon take another Troy
I can add colours to the chameleon
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages
And set the murderous Machiavel to school
Can I do this and cannot get a crown
Tut were it farther off Ill pluck it down
Exit
Flourish Enter KING LEWIS XI his sister BONA  his Admiral called BOURBON PRINCE EDWARD QUEEN  MARGARET and OXFORD KING LEWIS XI sits and riseth up again
Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret
Sit down with us it ill befits thy state
And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit
No mighty King of France now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command I was I must confess
Great Albions queen in former golden days
But now mischance hath trod my title down
And with dishonour laid me on the ground
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune
And to my humble seat conform myself
Why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares
Whateer it be be thou still like thyself
And sit thee by our side
Seats her by him
Yield not thy neck
To fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance
Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief
It shall be eased if France can yield relief
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak
Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis
That Henry sole possessor of my love
Is of a king become a banishd man
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of Englands trueanointed lawful king
This is the cause that I poor Margaret
With this my son Prince Edward Henrys heir
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
And if thou fail us all our hope is done
Scotland hath will to help but cannot help
Our people and our peers are both misled
Our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight
And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
Renowned queen with patience calm the storm
While we bethink a means to break it off
The more we stay the stronger grows our foe
The more I stay the more Ill succor thee
O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
Enter WARWICK
Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence
Our Earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friend
Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France
He descends She ariseth
Ay now begins a second storm to rise
For this is he that moves both wind and tide
From worthy Edward King of Albion
My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
I come in kindness and unfeigned love
First to do greetings to thy royal person
And then to crave a league of amity
And lastly to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister
To Englands king in lawful marriage
Aside  If that go forward Henrys hope is done
To BONA  And gracious madam in our kings behalf
I am commanded with your leave and favour
Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
To tell the passion of my sovereigns heart
Where fame late entering at his heedful ears
Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue
King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak
Before you answer Warwick His demand
Springs not from Edwards wellmeant honest love
But from deceit bred by necessity
For how can tyrants safely govern home
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
That Henry liveth still but were he dead
Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henrys son
Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile
Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs
Injurious Margaret
And why not queen
Because thy father Henry did usurp
And thou no more are prince than she is queen
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain
And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth
Who by his prowess conquered all France
From these our Henry lineally descends
Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that
But for the rest you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdoms worth
Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years
And not bewray thy treason with a blush
Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
For shame leave Henry and call Edward king
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere
Was done to death and more than so my father
Even in the downfall of his mellowd years
When nature brought him to the door of death
No Warwick no while life upholds this arm
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster
And I the house of York
Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford
Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
While I use further conference with Warwick
They stand aloof
Heavens grant that Warwicks words bewitch him not
Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
Is Edward your true king for I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour
But is he gracious in the peoples eye
The more that Henry was unfortunate
Then further all dissembling set aside
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona
Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant
Whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground
The leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun
Exempt from envy but not from disdain
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain
Now sister let us hear your firm resolve
Your grant or your denial shall be mine
To WARWICK
Yet I confess that often ere this day
When I have heard your kings desert recounted
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwards
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised
Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king
To Edward but not to the English king
Deceitful Warwick it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit
Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend
And still is friend to him and Margaret
But if your title to the crown be weak
As may appear by Edwards good success
Then tis but reason that I be released
From giving aid which late I promised
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease
Where having nothing nothing can he lose
And as for you yourself our quondam queen
You have a father able to maintain you
And better twere you troubled him than France
Peace impudent and shameless Warwick peace
Proud setter up and puller down of kings
I will not hence till with my talk and tears
Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather
Post blows a horn within
Warwick this is some post to us or thee
Enter a Post
To WARWICK  My lord ambassador these letters are for you
Sent from your brother Marquess Montague
To KING LEWIS XI
These from our king unto your majesty
To QUEEN MARGARET
And madam these for you from whom I know not
They all read their letters
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his
Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled
I hope alls for the best
Warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen
Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys
Mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent
What has your king married the Lady Grey
And now to soothe your forgery and his
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
I told your majesty as much before
This proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honesty
King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edwards
No more my king for he dishonours me
But most himself if he could see his shame
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece
Did I impale him with the regal crown
Did I put Henry from his native right
And am I guerdond at the last with shame
Shame on himself for my desert is honour
And to repair my honour lost for him
I here renounce him and return to Henry
My noble queen let former grudges pass
And henceforth I am thy true servitor
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona
And replant Henry in his former state
Warwick these words have turnd my hate to love
And I forgive and quite forget old faults
And joy that thou becomest King Henrys friend
So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers
Ill undertake to land them on our coast
And force the tyrant from his seat by war
Tis not his newmade bride shall succor him
And as for Clarence as my letters tell me
Hes very likely now to fall from him
For matching more for wanton lust than honour
Or than for strength and safety of our country
Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen
Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair
My quarrel and this English queens are one
And mine fair lady Bona joins with yours
And mine with hers and thine and Margarets
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
You shall have aid
Let me give humble thanks for all at once
Then Englands messenger return in post
And tell false Edward thy supposed king
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride
Thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal
Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
Ill wear the willow garland for his sake
Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
And I am ready to put armour on
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
And therefore Ill uncrown him eret be long
Theres thy reward be gone
Exit Post
But Warwick
Thou and Oxford with five thousand men
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle
And as occasion serves this noble queen
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply
Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
This shall assure my constant loyalty
That if our queen and this young prince agree
Ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
Yes I agree and thank you for your motion
Son Edward she is fair and virtuous
Therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
That only Warwicks daughter shall be thine
Yes I accept her for she well deserves it
And here to pledge my vow I give my hand
He gives his hand to WARWICK
Why stay we now These soldiers shall be levied
And thou Lord Bourbon our high admiral
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet
I long till Edward fall by wars mischance
For mocking marriage with a dame of France
Exeunt all but WARWICK
I came from Edward as ambassador
But I return his sworn and mortal foe
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
But dreadful war shall answer his demand
Had he none else to make a stale but me
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow
I was the chief that raised him to the crown
And Ill be chief to bring him down again
Not that I pity Henrys misery
But seek revenge on Edwards mockery
Exit
Enter GLOUCESTER CLARENCE SOMERSET and MONTAGUE
Now tell me brother Clarence what think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice
Alas you know tis far from hence to France
How could he stay till Warwick made return
My lords forbear this talk here comes the king
And his wellchosen bride
I mind to tell him plainly what I think
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV attended QUEEN ELIZABETH PEMBROKE STAFFORD HASTINGS and others
Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice
That you stand pensive as half malcontent
As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
That theyll take no offence at our abuse
Suppose they take offence without a cause
They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward
Your king and Warwicks and must have my will
And shall have your will because our king
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
Yea brother Richard are you offended too
Not I
No God forbid that I should wish them severd
Whom God hath joind together ay and twere pity
To sunder them that yoke so well together
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not become my wife and Englands queen
And you too Somerset and Montague
Speak freely what you think
Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy for mocking him
About the marriage of the Lady Bona
And Warwick doing what you gave in charge
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise
Yet to have joind with France in such alliance
Would more have strengthend this our commonwealth
Gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage
Why knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe if true within itself
But the safer when tis backd with France
Tis better using France than trusting France
Let us be backd with God and with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable
And with their helps only defend ourselves
In them and in ourselves our safety lies
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford
Ay what of that it was my will and grant
And for this once my will shall stand for law
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride
She better would have fitted me or Clarence
But in your bride you bury brotherhood
Or else you would not have bestowd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wifes son
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
Alas poor Clarence is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent I will provide thee
In choosing for yourself you showd your judgment
Which being shallow you give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you
Leave me or tarry Edward will be king
And not be tied unto his brothers will
My lords before it pleased his majesty
To raise my state to title of a queen
Do me but right and you must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descent
And meaner than myself have had like fortune
But as this title honours me and mine
So your dislike to whom I would be pleasing
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee
So long as Edward is thy constant friend
And their true sovereign whom they must obey
Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands
Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
Aside  I hear yet say not much but think the more
Enter a Post
Now messenger what letters or what news
From France
My sovereign liege no letters and few words
But such as I without your special pardon
Dare not relate
Go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters
At my depart these were his very words
Go tell false Edward thy supposed king
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride
Is Lewis so brave belike he thinks me Henry
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage
These were her words utterd with mad disdain
Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
Ill wear the willow garland for his sake
I blame not her she could say little less
She had the wrong But what said Henrys queen
For I have heard that she was there in place
Tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
And I am ready to put armour on
Belike she minds to play the Amazon
But what said Warwick to these injuries
He more incensed against your majesty
Than all the rest discharged me with these words
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
And therefore Ill uncrown him eret be long
Ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
Well I will arm me being thus forewarnd
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption
But say is Warwick friends with Margaret
Ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in
friendship
That young Prince Edward marries Warwicks daughter
Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger
Now brother king farewell and sit you fast
For I will hence to Warwicks other daughter
That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself
You that love me and Warwick follow me
Exit CLARENCE and SOMERSET follows
Aside  Not I
My thoughts aim at a further matter I
Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick
Yet am I armd against the worst can happen
And haste is needful in this desperate case
Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf
Go levy men and make prepare for war
They are already or quickly will be landed
Myself in person will straight follow you
Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
But ere I go Hastings and Montague
Resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me
If it be so then both depart to him
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends
But if you mind to hold your true obedience
Give me assurance with some friendly vow
That I may never have you in suspect
So God help Montague as he proves true
And Hastings as he favours Edwards cause
Now brother Richard will you stand by us
Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
Why so then am I sure of victory
Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power
Exeunt
Enter WARWICK and OXFORD with French soldiers
Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
The common people by numbers swarm to us
Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
But see where Somerset and Clarence come
Speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
Fear not that my lord
Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick
And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love
Else might I think that Clarence Edwards brother
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine
And now what rests but in nights coverture
Thy brother being carelessly encampd
His soldiers lurking in the towns about
And but attended by a simple guard
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus tents
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds
So we well coverd with the nights black mantle
At unawares may beat down Edwards guard
And seize himself I say not slaughter him
For I intend but only to surprise him
You that will follow me to this attempt
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader
They all cry Henry
Why then lets on our way in silent sort
For Warwick and his friends God and Saint George
Exeunt
Enter three Watchmen to guard KING EDWARD IVs tent
Come on my masters each man take his stand
The king by this is set him down to sleep
What will he not to bed
Why no for he hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppressd
Tomorrow then belike shall be the day
If Warwick be so near as men report
But say I pray what nobleman is that
That with the king here resteth in his tent
Tis the Lord Hastings the kings chiefest friend
O is it so But why commands the king
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him
While he himself keeps in the cold field
Tis the more honour because more dangerous
Ay but give me worship and quietness
I like it better than a dangerous honour
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands
Tis to be doubted he would waken him
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage
Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
But to defend his person from nightfoes
Enter WARWICK CLARENCE OXFORD SOMERSET and French soldiers silent all
This is his tent and see where stand his guard
Courage my masters honour now or never
But follow me and Edward shall be ours
Who goes there
Stay or thou diest
WARWICK and the rest cry all Warwick Warwick  and set upon the Guard who fly crying Arm arm WARWICK and the rest following them
The drum playing and trumpet sounding reenter  WARWICK SOMERSET and the rest bringing KING  EDWARD IV out in his gown sitting in a chair RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage
What are they that fly there
Richard and Hastings let them go here is The duke
The duke Why Warwick when we parted
Thou calldst me king
Ay but the case is alterd
When you disgraced me in my embassade
Then I degraded you from being king
And come now to create you Duke of York
Alas how should you govern any kingdom
That know not how to use ambassadors
Nor how to be contented with one wife
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly
Nor how to study for the peoples welfare
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
Yea brother of Clarence are thou here too
Nay then I see that Edward needs must down
Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance
Of thee thyself and all thy complices
Edward will always bear himself as king
Though fortunes malice overthrow my state
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
Then for his mind be Edward Englands king
Takes off his crown
But Henry now shall wear the English crown
And be true king indeed thou but the shadow
My Lord of Somerset at my request
See that forthwith Duke Edward be conveyd
Unto my brother Archbishop of York
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows
Ill follow you and tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him
Now for a while farewell good Duke of York
They lead him out forcibly
What fates impose that men must needs abide
It boots not to resist both wind and tide
Exit guarded
What now remains my lords for us to do
But march to London with our soldiers
Ay thats the first thing that we have to do
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne
Exeunt
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS
Madam what makes you in this sudden change
Why brother Rivers are you yet to learn
What late misfortune is befalln King Edward
What loss of some pitchd battle against Warwick
No but the loss of his own royal person
Then is my sovereign slain
Ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
Either betrayd by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares
And as I further have to understand
Is new committed to the Bishop of York
Fell Warwicks brother and by that our foe
These news I must confess are full of grief
Yet gracious madam bear it as you may
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day
Till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay
And I the rather wean me from despair
For love of Edwards offspring in my womb
This is it that makes me bridle passion
And bear with mildness my misfortunes cross
Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edwards fruit true heir to the English crown
But madam where is Warwick then become
I am informd that he comes towards London
To set the crown once more on Henrys head
Guess thou the rest King Edwards friends must down
But to prevent the tyrants violence
For trust not him that hath once broken faith
Ill hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
To save at least the heir of Edwards right
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud
Come therefore let us fly while we may fly
If Warwick take us we are sure to die
Exeunt
Enter GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and STANLEY
Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither
Into this chiefest thicket of the park
Thus stands the case you know our king my brother
Is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty
And often but attended with weak guard
Comes hunting this way to disport himself
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the colour of his usual game
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
To set him free from his captivity
Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him
This way my lord for this way lies the game
Nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand
Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest
Stand you thus close to steal the bishops deer
Brother the time and case requireth haste
Your horse stands ready at the parkcorner
But whither shall we then
To Lynn my lord
And ship from thence to Flanders
Well guessd believe me for that was my meaning
Stanley I will requite thy forwardness
But wherefore stay we tis no time to talk
Huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along
Better do so than tarry and be hangd
Come then away lets ha no more ado
Bishop farewell shield thee from Warwicks frown
And pray that I may repossess the crown
Exeunt
Flourish Enter KING HENRY VI CLARENCE WARWICK  SOMERSET HENRY OF RICHMOND OXFORD MONTAGUE and Lieutenant of the Tower
Master lieutenant now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat
And turnd my captive state to liberty
My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
At our enlargement what are thy due fees
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
But if an humble prayer may prevail
I then crave pardon of your majesty
For what lieutenant for well using me
Nay be thou sure Ill well requite thy kindness
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty
But Warwick after God thou setst me free
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee
He was the author thou the instrument
Therefore that I may conquer fortunes spite
By living low where fortune cannot hurt me
And that the people of this blessed land
May not be punishd with my thwarting stars
Warwick although my head still wear the crown
I here resign my government to thee
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
By spying and avoiding fortunes malice
For few men rightly temper with the stars
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
For choosing me when Clarence is in place
No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
As likely to be blest in peace and war
And therefore I yield thee my free consent
And I choose Clarence only for protector
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands
Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
That no dissension hinder government
I make you both protectors of this land
While I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days
To sins rebuke and my Creators praise
What answers Clarence to his sovereigns will
That he consents if Warwick yield consent
For on thy fortune I repose myself
Why then though loath yet must I be content
Well yoke together like a double shadow
To Henrys body and supply his place
I mean in bearing weight of government
While he enjoys the honour and his ease
And Clarence now then it is more than needful
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor
And all his lands and goods be confiscate
What else and that succession be determined
Ay therein Clarence shall not want his part
But with the first of all your chief affairs
Let me entreat for I command no more
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
Be sent for to return from France with speed
For till I see them here by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed
It shall be done my sovereign with all speed
My Lord of Somerset what youth is that
Of whom you seem to have so tender care
My liege it is young Henry earl of Richmond
Come hither Englands hope
Lays his hand on his head
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
This pretty lad will prove our countrys bliss
His looks are full of peaceful majesty
His head by nature framed to wear a crown
His hand to wield a sceptre and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne
Make much of him my lords for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me
Enter a Post
What news my friend
That Edward is escaped from your brother
And fled as he hears since to Burgundy
Unsavoury news but how made he escape
He was conveyd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings who attended him
In secret ambush on the forest side
And from the bishops huntsmen rescued him
For hunting was his daily exercise
My brother was too careless of his charge
But let us hence my sovereign to provide
A salve for any sore that may betide
Exeunt all but SOMERSET HENRY OF RICHMOND and OXFORD
My lord I like not of this flight of Edwards
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help
And we shall have more wars before t be long
As Henrys late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond
So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
What may befall him to his harm and ours
Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst
Forthwith well send him hence to Brittany
Till storms be past of civil enmity
Ay for if Edward repossess the crown
Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down
It shall be so he shall to Brittany
Come therefore lets about it speedily
Exeunt
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and Soldiers
Now brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends
And says that once more I shall interchange
My waned state for Henrys regal crown
Well have we passd and now repassd the seas
And brought desired help from Burgundy
What then remains we being thus arrived
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York
But that we enter as into our dukedom
The gates made fast Brother I like not this
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within
Tush man abodements must not now affright us
By fair or foul means we must enter in
For hither will our friends repair to us
My liege Ill knock once more to summon them
Enter on the walls the Mayor of York and his Brethren
My lords we were forewarned of your coming
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry
But master mayor if Henry be your king
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York
True my good lord I know you for no less
Why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom
As being well content with that alone
Aside  But when the fox hath once got in his nose
Hell soon find means to make the body follow
Why master mayor why stand you in a doubt
Open the gates we are King Henrys friends
Ay say you so the gates shall then be opend
They descend
A wise stout captain and soon persuaded
The good old man would fain that all were well
So twere not long of him but being enterd
I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason
Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen below
So master mayor these gates must not be shut
But in the night or in the time of war
What fear not man but yield me up the keys
Takes his keys
For Edward will defend the town and thee
And all those friends that deign to follow me
March Enter MONTGOMERY with drum and soldiers
Brother this is Sir John Montgomery
Our trusty friend unless I be deceived
Welcome Sir John But why come you in arms
To help King Edward in his time of storm
As every loyal subject ought to do
Thanks good Montgomery but we now forget
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest
Then fare you well for I will hence again
I came to serve a king and not a duke
Drummer strike up and let us march away
The drum begins to march
Nay stay Sir John awhi le and well debate
By what safe means the crown may be recoverd
What talk you of debating in few words
If youll not here proclaim yourself our king
Ill leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succor you
Why shall we fight if you pretend no title
Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
When we grow stronger then well make our claim
Till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
Away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
Brother we will proclaim you out of hand
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends
Then be it as you will for tis my right
And Henry but usurps the diadem
Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself
And now will I be Edwards champion
Sound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaimd
Come fellowsoldier make thou proclamation
Flourish
Edward the Fourth by the grace of God king of
England and France and lord of Ireland  and c
And whosoeer gainsays King Edwards right
By this I challenge him to single fight
Throws down his gauntlet
Long live Edward the Fourth
Thanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all
If fortune serve me Ill requite this kindness
Now for this night lets harbour here in York
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horizon
Well forward towards Warwick and his mates
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier
Ah froward Clarence how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother
Yet as we may well meet both thee and Warwick
Come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day
And that once gotten doubt not of large pay
Exeunt
Flourish Enter KING HENRY VI WARWICK MONTAGUE CLARENCE EXETER and OXFORD
What counsel lords Edward from Belgia
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders
Hath passd in safety through the narrow seas
And with his troops doth march amain to London
And many giddy people flock to him
Lets levy men and beat him back again
A little fire is quickly trodden out
Which being sufferd rivers cannot quench
In Warwickshire I have truehearted friends
Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
Those will I muster up and thou son Clarence
Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee
Thou brother Montague in Buckingham
Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou commandst
And thou brave Oxford wondrous well beloved
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
My sovereign with the loving citizens
Like to his island girt in with the ocean
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs
Shall rest in London till we come to him
Fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
Farewell my sovereign
Farewell my Hector and my Troys true hope
In sign of truth I kiss your highness hand
Wellminded Clarence be thou fortunate
Comfort my lord and so I take my leave
And thus I seal my truth and bid adieu
Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague
And all at once once more a happy farewell
Farewell sweet lords lets meet at Coventry
Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER
Here at the palace I will rest awhile
Cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest
Thats not my fear my meed hath got me fame
I have not stoppd mine ears to their demands
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
My mildness hath allayd their swelling griefs
My mercy dried their waterflowing tears
I have not been desirous of their wealth
Nor much oppressd them with great subsidies
Nor forward of revenge though they much errd
Then why should they love Edward more than me
No Exeter these graces challenge grace
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb
The lamb will never cease to follow him
Shout within A Lancaster A Lancaster
Hark hark my lord what shouts are these
Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER and soldiers
Seize on the shamefaced Henry bear him hence
And once again proclaim us King of England
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
Now stops thy spring my sea shal suck them dry
And swell so much the higher by their ebb
Hence with him to the Tower let him not speak
Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI
And lords towards Coventry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now remains
The sun shines hot and if we use delay
Cold biting winter mars our hopedfor hay
Away betimes before his forces join
And take the greatgrown traitor unawares
Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry
Exeunt
Enter WARWICK the Mayor of Coventry two Messengers and others upon the walls
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford
How far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow
By this at Dunsmore marching hitherward
How far off is our brother Montague
Where is the post that came from Montague
By this at Daintry with a puissant troop
Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE
Say Somerville what says my loving son
And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now
At Southam I did leave him with his forces
And do expect him here some two hours hence
Drum heard
Then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum
It is not his my lord here Southam lies
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick
Who should that be belike unlookdfor friends
They are at hand and you shall quickly know
March flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER and soldiers
Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall
O unbid spite is sportful Edward come
Where slept our scouts or how are they seduced
That we could hear no news of his repair
Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy
And he shall pardon thee these outrages
Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
Confess who set thee up and pluckd thee own
Call Warwick patron and be penitent
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York
I thought at least he would have said the king
Or did he make the jest against his will
Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
Ill do thee service for so good a gift
Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother
Why then tis mine if but by Warwicks gift
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight
And weakling Warwick takes his gift again
And Henry is my king Warwick his subject
But Warwicks king is Edwards prisoner
And gallant Warwick do but answer this
What is the body when the head is off
Alas that Warwick had no more forecast
But whiles he thought to steal the single ten
The king was slily fingerd from the deck
You left poor Henry at the Bishops palace
And ten to one youll meet him in the Tower
Tis even so yet you are Warwick still
Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
Nay when strike now or else the iron cools
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow
And with the other fling it at thy face
Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
Sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
This hand fast wound about thy coalblack hair
Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood
Windchanging Warwick now can change no more
Enter OXFORD with drum and colours
O cheerful colours see where Oxford comes
Oxford Oxford for Lancaster
He and his forces enter the city
The gates are open let us enter too
So other foes may set upon our backs
Stand we in good array for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle
If not the city being but of small defence
Well quickly rouse the traitors in the same
O welcome Oxford for we want thy help
Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours
Montague Montague for Lancaster
He and his forces enter the city
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear
The harder matchd the greater victory
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest
Enter SOMERSET with drum and colours
Somerset Somerset for Lancaster
He and his forces enter the city
Two of thy name both Dukes of Somerset
Have sold their lives unto the house of York
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold
Enter CLARENCE with drum and colours
And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along
Of force enough to bid his brother battle
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brothers love
Come Clarence come thou wilt if Warwick call
Father of Warwick know you what this means
Taking his red rose out of his hat
Look here I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my fathers house
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together
And set up Lancaster Why trowst thou Warwick
That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthahs when he sacrificed his daughter
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That to deserve well at my brothers hands
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
With resolution wheresoeer I meet thee
As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me
And so proudhearted Warwick I defy thee
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
Pardon me Edward I will make amends
And Richard do not frown upon my faults
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant
Now welcome more and ten times more beloved
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate
Welcome good Clarence this is brotherlike
O passing traitor perjured and unjust
What Warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
Alas I am not coopd here for defence
I will away towards Barnet presently
And bid thee battle Edward if thou darest
Yes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way
Lords to the field Saint George and victory
Exeunt King Edward and his company March Warwick and his company follow
Alarum and excursions Enter KING EDWARD IV bringing forth WARWICK wounded
So lie thou there die thou and die our fear
For Warwick was a bug that feard us all
Now Montague sit fast I seek for thee
That Warwicks bones may keep thine company
Exit
Ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe
And tell me who is victor York or Warwick
Why ask I that my mangled body shows
My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
That I must yield my body to the earth
And by my fall the conquest to my foe
Thus yields the cedar to the axes edge
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept
Whose topbranch overpeerd Joves spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winters powerful wind
These eyes that now are dimmd with deaths black veil
Have been as piercing as the midday sun
To search the secret treasons of the world
The wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
Were likend oft to kingly sepulchres
For who lived king but I could dig his grave
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow
Lo now my glory smeard in dust and blood
My parks my walks my manors that I had
Even now forsake me and of all my lands
Is nothing left me but my bodys length
Why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
And live we how we can yet die we must
Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are
We might recover all our loss again
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power
Even now we heard the news ah couldst thou fly
Why then I would not fly Ah Montague
If thou be there sweet brother take my hand
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
Thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak
Come quickly Montague or I am dead
Ah Warwick Montague hath breathed his last
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick
And said Commend me to my valiant brother
And more he would have said and more he spoke
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault
That mought not be distinguished but at last
I well might hear delivered with a groan
O farewell Warwick
Sweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven
Dies
Away away to meet the queens great power
Here they bear away his body Exeunt
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph with GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and the rest
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
And we are graced with wreaths of victory
But in the midst of this brightshining day
I spy a black suspicious threatening cloud
That will encounter with our glorious sun
Ere he attain his easeful western bed
I mean my lords those powers that the queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And as we hear march on to fight with us
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came
The very beams will dry those vapours up
For every cloud engenders not a storm
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong
And Somerset with Oxford fled to her
If she have time to breathe be well assured
We are advertised by our loving friends
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury
We having now the best at Barnet field
Will thither straight for willingness rids way
And as we march our strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along
Strike up the drum cry Courage and away
Exeunt
March Enter QUEEN MARGARET PRINCE EDWARD SOMERSET OXFORD and soldiers
Great lords wise men neer sit and wail their loss
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms
What though the mast be now blown overboard
The cable broke the holdinganchor lost
And half our sailors swallowd in the flood
Yet lives our pilot still Ist meet that he
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much
Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
Which industry and courage might have saved
Ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
Say Warwick was our anchor what of that
And Montague our topmost what of him
Our slaughterd friends the tackles what of these
Why is not Oxford here another anchor
And Somerset another goodly mast
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings
And though unskilful why not Ned and I
For once allowd the skilful pilots charge
We will not from the helm to sit and weep
But keep our course though the rough wind say no
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair
And what is Edward but ruthless sea
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock
All these the enemies to our poor bark
Say you can swim alas tis but a while
Tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
Bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
Or else you famish thats a threefold death
This speak I lords to let you understand
If case some one of you would fly from us
That theres no hopedfor mercy with the brothers
More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
Why courage then what cannot be avoided
Twere childish weakness to lament or fear
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should if a coward heard her speak these words
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
And make him naked foil a man at arms
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have leave to go away betimes
Lest in our need he might infect another
And make him of like spirit to himself
If any such be hereas God forbid
Let him depart before we need his help
Women and children of so high a courage
And warriors faint why twere perpetual shame
O brave young prince thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories
And he that will not fight for such a hope
Go home to bed and like the owl by day
If he arise be mockd and wonderd at
Thanks gentle Somerset sweet Oxford thanks
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else
Enter a Messenger
Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand
Ready to fight therefore be resolute
I thought no less it is his policy
To haste thus fast to find us unprovided
But hes deceived we are in readiness
This cheers my heart to see your forwardness
Here pitch our battle hence we will not budge
Flourish and march Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and soldiers
Brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood
Which by the heavens assistance and your strength
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night
I need not add more fuel to your fire
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight and to it lords
Lords knights and gentlemen what I should say
My tears gainsay for every word I speak
Ye see I drink the water of mine eyes
Therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign
Is prisoner to the foe his state usurpd
His realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain
His statutes cancelld and his treasure spent
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil
You fight in justice then in Gods name lords
Be valiant and give signal to the fight
Alarum Retreat Excursions Exeunt
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER CLARENCE  and soldiers with QUEEN MARGARET OXFORD and SOMERSET prisoners
Now here a period of tumultuous broils
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight
For Somerset off with his guilty head
Go bear them hence I will not hear them speak
For my part Ill not trouble thee with words
Nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune
Exeunt Oxford and Somerset guarded
So part we sadly in this troublous world
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem
Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward and he his life
It is and lo where youthful Edward comes
Enter soldiers with PRINCE EDWARD
Bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak
What can so young a thorn begin to prick
For bearing arms for stirring up my subjects
And all the trouble thou hast turnd me to
Speak like a subject proud ambitious York
Suppose that I am now my fathers mouth
Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee
Which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to
Ah that thy father had been so resolved
That you might still have worn the petticoat
And neer have stoln the breech from Lancaster
Let AEsop fable in a winters night
His currish riddles sort not with this place
By heaven brat Ill plague ye for that word
Ay thou wast born to be a plague to men
For Gods sake take away this captive scold
Nay take away this scolding crookback rather
Peace wilful boy or I will charm your tongue
Untutord lad thou art too malapert
I know my duty you are all undutiful
Lascivious Edward and thou perjured George
And thou misshapen Dick I tell ye all
I am your better traitors as ye are
And thou usurpst my fathers right and mine
Take that thou likeness of this railer here
Stabs him
Sprawlst thou take that to end thy agony
Stabs him
And theres for twitting me with perjury
Stabs him
O kill me too
Marry and shall
Offers to kill her
Hold Richard hold for we have done too much
Why should she live to fill the world with words
What doth she swoon use means for her recovery
Clarence excuse me to the king my brother
Ill hence to London on a serious matter
Ere ye come there be sure to hear some news
What what
The Tower the Tower
Exit
O Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boy
Canst thou not speak O traitors murderers
They that stabbd Caesar shed no blood at all
Did not offend nor were not worthy blame
If this foul deed were by to equal it
He was a man this in respect a child
And men neer spend their fury on a child
Whats worse than murderer that I may name it
No no my heart will burst and if I speak
And I will speak that so my heart may burst
Butchers and villains bloody cannibals
How sweet a plant have you untimely croppd
You have no children butchers if you had
The thought of them would have stirrd up remorse
But if you ever chance to have a child
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As deathmen you have rid this sweet young prince
Away with her go bear her hence perforce
Nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
Here sheathe thy sword Ill pardon thee my death
What wilt thou not then Clarence do it thou
By heaven I will not do thee so much ease
Good Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do it
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it
Ay but thou usest to forswear thyself
Twas sin before but now tis charity
What wilt thou not Where is that devils butcher
Hardfavourd Richard Richard where art thou
Thou art not here murder is thy almsdeed
Petitioners for blood thou neer putst back
Away I say I charge ye bear her hence
So come to you and yours as to this Prince
Exit led out forcibly
Wheres Richard gone
To London all in post and as I guess
To make a bloody supper in the Tower
Hes sudden if a thing comes in his head
Now march we hence discharge the common sort
With pay and thanks and lets away to London
And see our gentle queen how well she fares
By this I hope she hath a son for me
Exeunt
Enter KING HENRY VI and GLOUCESTER with the Lieutenant on the walls
Good day my lord What at your book so hard
Ay my good lordmy lord I should say rather
Tis sin to flatter good was little better
Good Gloucester and good devil were alike
And both preposterous therefore not good lord
Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer
Exit Lieutenant
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next his throat unto the butchers knife
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
The thief doth fear each bush an officer
The bird that hath been limed in a bush
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
And I the hapless male to one sweet bird
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Where my poor young was limed was caught and killd
Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete
That taught his son the office of a fowl
An yet for all his wings the fool was drownd
I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus
Thy father Minos that denied our course
The sun that seard the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
My breast can better brook thy daggers point
Than can my ears that tragic history
But wherefore dost thou come ist for my life
Thinkst thou I am an executioner
A persecutor I am sure thou art
If murdering innocents be executing
Why then thou art an executioner
Thy son I killd for his presumption
Hadst thou been killd when first thou didst presume
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine
And thus I prophesy that many a thousand
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
And many an old mans sigh and many a widows
And many an orphans waterstanding eye
Men for their sons wives for their husbands
And orphans for their parents timeless death
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
The owl shriekd at thy birthan evil sign
The nightcrow cried aboding luckless time
Dogs howld and hideous tempest shook down trees
The raven rookd her on the chimneys top
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung
Thy mother felt more than a mothers pain
And yet brought forth less than a mothers hope
To wit an indigested and deformed lump
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
To signify thou camest to bite the world
And if the rest be true which I have heard
Thou camest
Ill hear no more die prophet in thy speech
Stabs him
For this amongst the rest was I ordaind
Ay and for much more slaughter after this
God forgive my sins and pardon thee
Dies
What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted
See how my sword weeps for the poor kings death
O may such purple tears be alway shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house
If any spark of life be yet remaining
Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither
Stabs him again
I that have neither pity love nor fear
Indeed tis true that Henry told me of
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward
Had I not reason think ye to make haste
And seek their ruin that usurpd our right
The midwife wonderd and the women cried
O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth
And so I was which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog
Then since the heavens have shaped my body so
Let hell make crookd my mind to answer it
I have no brother I am like no brother
And this word love which graybeards call divine
Be resident in men like one another
And not in me I am myself alone
Clarence beware thou keepst me from the light
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life
And then to purge his fear Ill be thy death
King Henry and the prince his son are gone
Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
Counting myself but bad till I be best
Ill throw thy body in another room
And triumph Henry in thy day of doom
Exit with the body
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV QUEEN ELIZABETH  CLARENCE GLOUCESTER HASTINGS a Nurse with the young Prince and Attendants
Once more we sit in Englands royal throne
Repurchased with the blood of enemies
What valiant foemen like to autumns corn
Have we mowd down in tops of all their pride
Three Dukes of Somerset threefold renownd
For hardy and undoubted champions
Two Cliffords as the father and the son
And two Northumberlands two braver men
Neer spurrd their coursers at the trumpets sound
With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague
That in their chains fetterd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roard
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security
Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy
Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watchd the winters night
Went all afoot in summers scalding heat
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain
Aside  Ill blast his harvest if your head were laid
For yet I am not lookd on in the world
This shoulder was ordaind so thick to heave
And heave it shall some weight or break my back
Work thou the wayand thou shalt execute
Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen
And kiss your princely nephew brothers both
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe
Thanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanks
And that I love the tree from whence thou sprangst
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit
Aside
And cried all hail when as he meant all harm
Now am I seated as my soul delights
Having my countrys peace and brothers loves
What will your grace have done with Margaret
Reignier her father to the king of France
Hath pawnd the Sicils and Jerusalem
And hither have they sent it for her ransom
Away with her and waft her hence to France
And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
Such as befits the pleasure of the court
Sound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoy
For here I hope begins our lasting joy
Exeunt
Enter BERTRAM the COUNTESS of Rousillon HELENA and LAFEU all in black
In delivering my son from me I bury a second husband
And I in going madam weep oer my fathers death
anew but I must attend his majestys command to
whom I am now in ward evermore in subjection
You shall find of the king a husband madam you
sir a father he that so generally is at all times
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
than lack it where there is such abundance
What hope is there of his majestys amendment
He hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose
finds no other advantage in the process but only the
losing of hope by time
This young gentlewoman had a fatherO that
had how sad a passage tiswhose skill was
almost as great as his honesty had it stretched so
far would have made nature immortal and death
should have play for lack of work Would for the
kings sake he were living I think it would be
the death of the kings disease
How called you the man you speak of madam
He was famous sir in his profession and it was
his great right to be so Gerard de Narbon
He was excellent indeed madam the king very
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he
was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge
could be set up against mortality
What is it my good lord the king languishes of
A fistula my lord
I heard not of it before
I would it were not notorious Was this gentlewoman
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon
His sole child my lord and bequeathed to my
overlooking I have those hopes of her good that
her education promises her dispositions she
inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there
commendations go with pity they are virtues and
traitors too in her they are the better for their
simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness
Your commendations madam get from her tears
Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
in The remembrance of her father never approaches
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
livelihood from her cheek No more of this Helena
go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect
a sorrow than have it
I do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it too
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead
excessive grief the enemy to the living
If the living be enemy to the grief the excess
makes it soon mortal
Madam I desire your holy wishes
How understand we that
Be thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father
In manners as in shape thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright Love all trust a few
Do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use and keep thy friend
Under thy own lifes key be chequed for silence
But never taxd for speech What heaven more will
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
Fall on thy head Farewell my lord
Tis an unseasond courtier good my lord
Advise him
He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love
Heaven bless him Farewell Bertram
Exit
To HELENA  The best wishes that can be forged in
your thoughts be servants to you Be comfortable
to my mother your mistress and make much of her
Farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of
your father
Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
O were that all I think not on my father
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him What was he like
I have forgot him my imagination
Carries no favour int but Bertrams
I am undone there is no living none
If Bertram be away Twere all one
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it he is so above me
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted not in his sphere
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love Twas pretty though plague
To see him every hour to sit and draw
His arched brows his hawking eye his curls
In our hearts table heart too capable
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour
But now hes gone and my idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify his reliques Who comes here
Enter PAROLLES
Aside
One that goes with him I love him for his sake
And yet I know him a notorious liar
Think him a great way fool solely a coward
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
That they take place when virtues steely bones
Look bleak i the cold wind withal full oft we see
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
Save you fair queen
And you monarch
No
And no
Are you meditating on virginity
Ay You have some stain of soldier in you let me
ask you a question Man is enemy to virginity how
may we barricado it against him
Keep him out
But he assails and our virginity though valiant
in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some
warlike resistance
There is none man sitting down before you will
undermine you and blow you up
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
blowers up Is there no military policy how
virgins might blow up men
Virginity being blown down man will quicklier be
blown up marry in blowing him down again with
the breach yourselves made you lose your city It
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
preserve virginity Loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till
virginity was first lost That you were made of is
metal to make virgins Virginity by being once lost
may be ten times found by being ever kept it is
ever lost tis too cold a companion away with t
I will stand for t a little though therefore I die a virgin
Theres little can be said in t tis against the
rule of nature To speak on the part of virginity
is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible
disobedience He that hangs himself is a virgin
virginity murders itself and should be buried in
highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites
much like a cheese consumes itself to the very
paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach
Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of
selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the
canon Keep it not you cannot choose but loose
byt out with t within ten year it will make
itself ten which is a goodly increase and the
principal itself not much the worse away with t
How might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
Let me see marry ill to like him that neer it
likes Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
lying the longer kept the less worth off with t
while tis vendible answer the time of request
Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out
of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just
like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not
now Your date is better in your pie and your
porridge than in your cheek and your virginity
your old virginity is like one of our French
withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry
tis a withered pear it was formerly better
marry yet tis a withered pear will you anything with it
Not my virginity yet          
There shall your master have a thousand loves
A mother and a mistress and a friend
A phoenix captain and an enemy
A guide a goddess and a sovereign
A counsellor a traitress and a dear
His humble ambition proud humility
His jarring concord and his discord dulcet
His faith his sweet disaster with a world
Of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
That blinking Cupid gossips Now shall he
I know not what he shall God send him well
The courts a learning place and he is one
What one i faith
That I wish well Tis pity
Whats pity
That wishing well had not a body int
Which might be felt that we the poorer born
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
Might with effects of them follow our friends
And show what we alone must think which never
Return us thanks

Monsieur Parolles my lord calls for you
Exit
Little Helen farewell if I can remember thee I
will think of thee at court
Monsieur Parolles you were born under a charitable star
Under Mars I
I especially think under Mars
Why under Mars
The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
be born under Mars
When he was predominant
When he was retrograde I think rather
Why think you so
You go so much backward when you fight
Thats for advantage
So is running away when fear proposes the safety
but the composition that your valour and fear makes
in you is a virtue of a good wing and I like the wear well
I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee
acutely I will return perfect courtier in the
which my instruction shall serve to naturalize
thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtiers
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and
thine ignorance makes thee away farewell When
thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast
none remember thy friends get thee a good husband
and use him as he uses thee so farewell
Exit
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
Which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky
Gives us free scope only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
What power is it which mounts my love so high
That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
What hath been cannot be who ever strove
So show her merit that did miss her love
The kings diseasemy project may deceive me
But my intents are fixd and will not leave me

Flourish of cornets Enter the KING of France with letters and divers Attendants
The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears
Have fought with equal fortune and continue
A braving war
So tis reported sir
Nay tis most credible we here received it
A certainty vouchd from our cousin Austria
With caution that the Florentine will move us
For speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
Prejudicates the business and would seem
To have us make denial
His love and wisdom
Approved so to your majesty may plead
For amplest credence
He hath armd our answer
And Florence is denied before he comes
Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
The Tuscan service freely have they leave
To stand on either part
It well may serve
A nursery to our gentry who are sick
For breathing and exploit

As when thy father and myself in friendship
First tried our soldiership He did look far
Into the service of the time and was
Discipled of the bravest he lasted long
But on us both did haggish age steal on
To talk of your good father In his youth
He had the wit which I can well observe
Today in our young lords but they may jest
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
Ere they can hide their levity in honour
So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
Were in his pride or sharpness if they were
His equal had awaked them and his honour
Clock to itself knew the true minute when
Exception bid him speak and at this time
His tongue obeyd his hand who were below him
He used as creatures of another place
And bowd his eminent top to their low ranks
Making them proud of his humility
In their poor praise he humbled Such a man
Might be a copy to these younger times
Which followd well would demonstrate them now
But goers backward
His good remembrance sir
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech
Would I were with him He would always say
Methinks I hear him now his plausive words
He scatterd not in ears but grafted them
To grow there and to bearLet me not live
This his good melancholy oft began
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime
When it was outLet me not live quoth he
After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff
Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
All but new things disdain whose judgments are
Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
Expire before their fashions This he wishd
I after him do after him wish too
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home
I quickly were dissolved from my hive
To give some labourers room
You are loved sir
They that least lend it you shall lack you first
I fill a place I knowt How long ist count
Since the physician at your fathers died
He was much famed
Some six months since my lord
If he were living I would try him yet
Lend me an arm the rest have worn me out
With several applications nature and sickness
Debate it at their leisure Welcome count
My sons no dearer
Thank your majesty

I will now hear what say you of this gentlewoman
Madam the care I have had to even your content I

foul the clearness of our deservings when of
ourselves we publish them

many of the rich are damned but if I may have

In Isbels case and mine own Service is no
heritage and I think I shall never have the
blessing of God till I have issue o my body for
they say barnes are blessings
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry
My poor body madam requires it I am driven on
by the flesh and he must needs go that the devil drives
Is this all your worships reason
Faith madam I have other holy reasons such as they
are
May the world know them
I have been madam a wicked creature as you and
all flesh and blood are and indeed I do marry
that I may repent
Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness
I am out o friends madam and I hope to have
friends for my wifes sake
Such friends are thine enemies knave
Youre shallow madam in great friends for the
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
leave to in the crop if I be his cuckold hes my
drudge he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh
and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my
flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses
my wife is my friend If men could be contented to
be what they are there were no fear in marriage
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
Papist howsomeer their hearts are severed in
religion their heads are both one they may jowl
horns together like any deer i the herd
Wilt thou ever be a foulmouthed and calumnious knave
A prophet I madam and I speak the truth the next
way
For I the ballad will repeat
Which men full true shall find
Your marriage comes by destiny
Your cuckoo sings by kind
Get you gone sir Ill talk with you more anon
May it please you madam that he bid Helen come to
you of her I am to speak
Sirrah tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her
Helen I mean
Was this fair face the cause quoth she
Why the Grecians sacked Troy
Fond done done fond
Was this King Priams joy
With that she sighed as she stood
With that she sighed as she stood
And gave this sentence then
Among nine bad if one be good
Among nine bad if one be good
Theres yet one good in ten
What one good in ten you corrupt the song sirrah
One good woman in ten madam which is a purifying
o the song would God would serve the world so all

star or at an earthquake twould mend the lottery

That man should be at womans command and yet no
hurt done Though honesty be no puritan yet it
will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of
humility over the black gown of a big heart I am
going forsooth the business is for Helen to come hither
Exit
Well now
I know madam you love your gentlewoman entirely
Faith I do her father bequeathed her to me and
she herself without other advantage may lawfully
make title to as much love as she finds there is
more owing her than is paid and more shall be paid
her than shell demand
Madam I was very late more near her than I think
she wished me alone she was and did communicate
to herself her own words to her own ears she
thought I dare vow for her they touched not any
stranger sense Her matter was she loved your son
Fortune she said was no goddess that had put
such difference betwixt their two estates Love no
god that would not extend his might only where
qualities were level Dian no queen of virgins that
would suffer her poor knight surprised without
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
sorrow that eer I heard virgin exclaim in which I
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal
sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns
you something to know it
You have discharged this honestly keep it to
yourself many likelihoods informed me of this
before which hung so tottering in the balance that
I could neither believe nor misdoubt Pray you
leave me stall this in your bosom and I thank you
for your honest care I will speak with you further anon

Enter HELENA
Even so it was with me when I was young
If ever we are natures these are ours this thorn
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
Our blood to us this to our blood is born
It is the show and seal of natures truth
Where loves strong passion is impressd in youth
By our remembrances of days foregone
Such were our faults or then we thought them none
Her eye is sick ont I observe her now
What is your pleasure madam
You know Helen
I am a mother to you
Mine honourable mistress
Nay a mother
Why not a mother When I said a mother
Methought you saw a serpent whats in mother
That you start at it I say I am your mother
And put you in the catalogue of those
That were enwombed mine tis often seen
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
A native slip to us from foreign seeds
You neer oppressd me with a mothers groan
Yet I express to you a mothers care
Gods mercy maiden does it curd thy blood
To say I am thy mother Whats the matter
That this distemperd messenger of wet
The manycolourd Iris rounds thine eye
Why that you are my daughter
That I am not
I say I am your mother
Pardon madam
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother
I am from humble he from honourd name
No note upon my parents his all noble
My master my dear lord he is and I
His servant live and will his vassal die
He must not be my brother
Nor I your mother
You are my mother madam would you were
So that my lord your son were not my brother
Indeed my mother or were you both our mothers
I care no more for than I do for heaven
So I were not his sister Cant no other
But I your daughter he must be my brother
Yes Helen you might be my daughterinlaw
God shield you mean it not daughter and mother
So strive upon your pulse What pale again
My fear hath catchd your fondness now I see
The mystery of your loneliness and find
Your salt tears head now to all sense tis gross
You love my son invention is ashamed
Against the proclamation of thy passion
To say thou dost not therefore tell me true
But tell me then tis so for look thy cheeks
Confess it th one to th other and thine eyes
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
That in their kind they speak it only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
That truth should be suspected Speak ist so
If it be so you have wound a goodly clew
If it be not forsweart howeer I charge thee
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail
Tell me truly
Good madam pardon me
Do you love my son
Your pardon noble mistress
Love you my son
Do not you love him madam
Go not about my love hath int a bond
Whereof the world takes note come come disclose
The state of your affection for your passions
Have to the full appeachd
Then I confess
Here on my knee before high heaven and you
That before you and next unto high heaven
I love your son
My friends were poor but honest sos my love
Be not offended for it hurts not him
That he is loved of me I follow him not
By any token of presumptuous suit
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him
Yet never know how that desert should be
I know I love in vain strive against hope
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
I still pour in the waters of my love
And lack not to lose still thus Indianlike
Religious in mine error I adore
The sun that looks upon his worshipper
But knows of him no more My dearest madam
Let not your hate encounter with my love
For loving where you do but if yourself
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
Did ever in so true a flame of liking
Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
Was both herself and love O then give pity
To her whose state is such that cannot choose
But lend and give where she is sure to lose
That seeks not to find that her search implies
But riddlelike lives sweetly where she dies
Had you not lately an intentspeak truly
To go to Paris
Madam I had
Wherefore tell true
I will tell truth by grace itself I swear
You know my father left me some prescriptions
Of rare and proved effects such as his reading
And manifest experience had collected
For general sovereignty and that he willd me
In heedfullst reservation to bestow them
As notes whose faculties inclusive were
More than they were in note amongst the rest
There is a remedy approved set down
To cure the desperate languishings whereof
The king is renderd lost
This was your motive
For Paris was it speak
My lord your son made me to think of this
Else Paris and the medicine and the king
Had from the conversation of my thoughts
Haply been absent then
But think you Helen
If you should tender your supposed aid
He would receive it he and his physicians
Are of a mind he that they cannot help him
They that they cannot help how shall they credit
A poor unlearned virgin when the schools
Embowelld of their doctrine have left off
The danger to itself
Theres something int
More than my fathers skill which was the greatest
Of his profession that his good receipt
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
By the luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
But give me leave to try success Ild venture
The welllost life of mine on his graces cure
By such a day and hour
Dost thou believet
Ay madam knowingly
Why Helen thou shalt have my leave and love
Means and attendants and my loving greetings
To those of mine in court Ill stay at home
And pray Gods blessing into thy attempt
Be gone tomorrow and be sure of this
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss

And that at my bidding you could so stand up
I would I had so I had broke thy pate
And askd thee mercy fort
Good faith across but my good lord tis thus
Will you be cured of your infirmity
No
O will you eat no grapes my royal fox
Yes but you will my noble grapes an if
My royal fox could reach them I have seen a medicine
Thats able to breathe life into a stone
Quicken a rock and make you dance canary
With spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
Is powerful to araise King Pepin nay
To give great Charlemain a pen ins hand
And write to her a loveline
What her is this
Why Doctor She my lord theres one arrived
If you will see her now by my faith and honour
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance I have spoke
With one that in her sex her years profession
Wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more
Than I dare blame my weakness will you see her
For that is her demand and know her business
That done laugh well at me
Now good Lafeu

May spend our wonder too or take off thine

A traitor you do look like but such traitors
His majesty seldom fears I am Cressids uncle
That dare leave two together fare you well
Exit
Now fair one does your business follow us
Ay my good lord
Gerard de Narbon was my father
In what he did profess well found
I knew him
The rather will I spare my praises towards him
Knowing him is enough Ons bed of death
Many receipts he gave me chiefly one
And of his old experience the oily darling
He bade me store up as a triple eye
Safer than mine own two more dear I have so
And hearing your high majesty is touchd
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
Of my dear fathers gift stands chief in power
I come to tender it and my appliance
With all bound humbleness
We thank you maiden
But may not be so credulous of cure
When our most learned doctors leave us and
The congregated college have concluded
That labouring art can never ransom nature
From her inaidible estate I say we must not
So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
To prostitute our pastcure malady
To empirics or to dissever so
Our great self and our credit to esteem
A senseless help when help past sense we deem
My duty then shall pay me for my pains
I will no more enforce mine office on you
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
A modest one to bear me back again
I cannot give thee less to be calld grateful
Thou thoughtst to help me and such thanks I give
As one near death to those that wish him live
But what at full I know thou knowst no part
I knowing all my peril thou no art
What I can do can do no hurt to try
Since you set up your rest gainst remedy
He that of greatest works is finisher
Oft does them by the weakest minister
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
When judges have been babes great floods have flown
From simple sources and great seas have dried
When miracles have by the greatest been denied
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
Where most it promises and oft it hits
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits
I must not hear thee fare thee well kind maid
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
Inspired merit so by breath is barrd
It is not so with Him that all things knows
As tis with us that square our guess by shows
But most it is presumption in us when
Dear sir to my endeavours give consent
Of heaven not me make an experiment
I am not an impostor that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim
But know I think and think I know most sure
My art is not past power nor you past cure
Are thou so confident within what space
Hopest thou my cure
The greatst grace lending grace
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
Moist Hesperus hath quenchd his sleepy lamp
Or four and twenty times the pilots glass
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
Health shall live free and sickness freely die
Upon thy certainty and confidence
What darest thou venture
Tax of impudence
A strumpets boldness a divulged shame
Traduced by odious ballads my maidens name
Seard otherwise nay worseif worseextended
With vilest torture let my life be ended
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
His powerful sound within an organ weak
And what impossibility would slay
In common sense sense saves another way
Thy life is dear for all that life can rate
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate
Youth beauty wisdom courage all
That happiness and prime can happy call
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate
That ministers thine own death if I die
If I break time or flinch in property
Of what I spoke unpitied let me die
And well deserved not helping deaths my fee
But if I help what do you promise me
Make thy demand
But will you make it even
Ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state
But such a one thy vassal whom I know
Is free for me to ask thee to bestow
Here is my hand the premises observed
Thy will by my performance shall be served
So make the choice of thy own time for I
Thy resolved patient on thee still rely
More should I question thee and more I must
Though more to know could not be more to trust
From whence thou camest how tended on but rest
Unquestiond welcome and undoubted blest
Give me some help here ho If thou proceed
As high as word my deed shall match thy meed

Come on sir I shall now put you to the height of
your breeding
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught I
know my business is but to the court
To the court why what place make you special
when you put off that with such contempt But to the court
Truly madam if God have lent a man any manners he
may easily put it off at court he that cannot make
a leg put offs cap kiss his hand and say nothing
has neither leg hands lip nor cap and indeed
such a fellow to say precisely were not for the
court but for me I have an answer will serve all
men
Marry thats a bountiful answer that fits all
questions
It is like a barbers chair that fits all buttocks
the pinbuttock the quatchbuttock the brawn
buttock or any buttock
Will your answer serve fit to all questions
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney
as your French crown for your taffeta punk as Tibs
rush for Toms forefinger as a pancake for Shrove
Tuesday a morris for Mayday as the nail to his
hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding queen
to a wrangling knave as the nuns lip to the
friars mouth nay as the pudding to his skin
Have you I say an answer of such fitness for all
questions
From below your duke to beneath your constable it
will fit any question
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
must fit all demands
But a trifle neither in good faith if the learned
should speak truth of it here it is and all that
belongs tot Ask me if I am a courtier it shall
do you no harm to learn
To be young again if we could I will be a fool in
question hoping to be the wiser by your answer I
pray you sir are you a courtier
O Lord sir Theres a simple putting off More
more a hundred of them
Sir I am a poor friend of yours that loves you
O Lord sir Thick thick spare not me
I think sir you can eat none of this homely meat
O Lord sir Nay put me tot I warrant you
You were lately whipped sir as I think
O Lord sir spare not me
Do you cry O Lord sir at your whipping and
spare not me Indeed your O Lord sir is very
sequent to your whipping you would answer very well
to a whipping if you were but bound tot
I neer had worse luck in my life in my O Lord
sir I see things may serve long but not serve ever
I play the noble housewife with the time
To entertaint so merrily with a fool
O Lord sir why theret serves well again
An end sir to your business Give Helen this

They say miracles are past and we have our

Thou hast repeald a second time receive

Which but attends thy naming

Fair maid send forth thine eye this youthful parcel
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing
Oer whom both sovereign power and fathers voice
I have to use thy frank election make
Thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
Fall when Love please marry to each but one
Ild give bay Curtal and his furniture
My mouth no more were broken than these boys
And writ as little beard
Peruse them well
Not one of those but had a noble father
Gentlemen
Heaven hath through me restored the king to health
We understand it and thank heaven for you
I am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
That I protest I simply am a maid
Please it your majesty I have done already
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
We blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
Well neer come there again
Make choice and see
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
Now Dian from thy altar do I fly
And to imperial Love that god most high
Do my sighs stream Sir will you hear my suit
And grant it
Thanks sir all the rest is mute
I had rather be in this choice than throw amesace
for my life
The honour sir that flames in your fair eyes
Before I speak too threateningly replies
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes and her humble love
No better if you please
My wish receive
Which great Love grant and so I take my leave
Do all they deny her An they were sons of mine
Id have them whipped or I would send them to the
Turk to make eunuchs of
Be not afraid that I your hand should take
Ill never do you wrong for your own sake
Blessing upon your vows and in your bed
Find fairer fortune if you ever wed
These boys are boys of ice theyll none have her
sure they are bastards to the English the French

of fourteen I have known thee already
To BERTRAM  I dare not say I take you but I give
Me and my service ever whilst I live
Into your guiding power This is the man
Why then young Bertram take her shes thy wife
My wife my liege I shall beseech your highness
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes
Knowst thou not Bertram
What she has done for me
Yes my good lord
But never hope to know why I should marry her
Thou knowst she has raised me from my sickly bed
But follows it my lord to bring me down
Must answer for your raising I know her well
She had her breeding at my fathers charge
A poor physicians daughter my wife Disdain
Rather corrupt me ever
Tis only title thou disdainst in her the which
I can build up Strange is it that our bloods
Of colour weight and heat pourd all together
Would quite confound distinction yet stand off
In differences so mighty If she be
All that is virtuous save what thou dislikest
A poor physicians daughter thou dislikest
Of virtue for the name but do not so
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed
The place is dignified by the doers deed
Where great additions swells and virtue none
It is a dropsied honour Good alone
Is good without a name Vileness is so
The property by what it is should go
Not by the title She is young wise fair
In these to nature shes immediate heir
And these breed honour that is honours scorn
Which challenges itself as honours born
And is not like the sire honours thrive
Than our foregoers the mere words a slave
Deboshd on every tomb on every grave
A lying trophy and as oft is dumb
Where dust and damnd oblivion is the tomb
Of honourd bones indeed What should be said
If thou canst like this creature as a maid
I can create the rest virtue and she
Is her own dower honour and wealth from me
I cannot love her nor will strive to dot
Thou wrongst thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
That you are well restored my lord Im glad
Let the rest go
My honours at the stake which to defeat
I must produce my power Here take her hand
Proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert that canst not dream
We poising us in her defective scale
Shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
It is in us to plant thine honour where
We please to have it grow Cheque thy contempt
Obey our will which travails in thy good
Believe not thy disdain but presently
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
Loosing upon thee in the name of justice
Without all terms of pity Speak thine answer
Pardon my gracious lord for I submit
My fancy to your eyes when I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it I find that she which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
The praised of the king who so ennobled
Is as twere born so
Take her by the hand
And tell her she is thine to whom I promise
A counterpoise if not to thy estate
A balance more replete
I take her hand
Good fortune and the favour of the king
Shall seem expedient on the nowborn brief
And be performd tonight the solemn feast
Shall more attend upon the coming space
Expecting absent friends As thou lovest her

A most harsh one and not to be understood without
bloody succeeding My master
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon
To any count to all counts to what is man
To what is counts man counts master is of
another style
You are too old sir let it satisfy you you are too old
I must tell thee sirrah I write man to which
title age cannot bring thee
What I dare too well do I dare not do
I did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty
wise fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
travel it might pass yet the scarfs and the
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen I
have now found thee when I lose thee again I care
not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up and
that thout scarce worth
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou
hasten thy trial which ifLord have mercy on thee
for a hen So my good window of lattice fare thee
well thy casement I need not open for I look
through thee Give me thy hand
My lord you give me most egregious indignity
Ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it
I have not my lord deserved it
Yes good faith every dram of it and I will not
bate thee a scruple
Well I shall be wiser
Even as soon as thou canst for thou hast to pull at
a smack o the contrary If ever thou best bound
in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is
to be proud of thy bondage I have a desire to hold
my acquaintance with thee or rather my knowledge
that I may say in the default he is a man I know
My lord you do me most insupportable vexation
I would it were hellpains for thy sake and my poor
doing eternal for doing I am past as I will by
thee in what motion age will give me leave

Go to sir you were beaten in Italy for picking a

birth and virtue gives you heraldry You are not

Reenter BERTRAM
Undone and forfeited to cares for ever
Whats the matter sweetheart
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn
I will not bed her
What what sweetheart
O my Parolles they have married me
Ill to the Tuscan wars and never bed her
France is a doghole and it no more merits
The tread of a mans foot to the wars
Theres letters from my mother what the import is
I know not yet
Ay that would be known To the wars my boy to the wars
He wears his honour in a box unseen
That hugs his kickywicky here at home
Spending his manly marrow in her arms
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
Of Marss fiery steed To other regions
France is a stable we that dwell int jades
Therefore to the war
It shall be so Ill send her to my house
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her
And wherefore I am fled write to the king
That which I durst not speak his present gift
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
Where noble fellows strike war is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife
Will this capriccio hold in thee art sure
Go with me to my chamber and advise me
Ill send her straight away tomorrow
Ill to the wars she to her single sorrow
Why these balls bound theres noise in it Tis hard
A young man married is a man thats marrd
Therefore away and leave her bravely go
The king has done you wrong but hush tis so
Exeunt

What two things
One that shes not in heaven whither God send her
quickly the other that shes in earth from whence
God send her quickly
Enter PAROLLES
Bless you my fortunate lady
I hope sir I have your good will to have mine own
good fortunes
You had my prayers to lead them on and to keep them
on have them still O my knave how does my old lady
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money
I would she did as you say
Why I say nothing
Marry you are the wiser man for many a mans
tongue shakes out his masters undoing to say
nothing to do nothing to know nothing and to have
nothing is to be a great part of your title which
is within a very little of nothing
Away thourt a knave
You should have said sir before a knave thourt a
knave thats before me thourt a knave this had
been truth sir
Go to thou art a witty fool I have found thee
Did you find me in yourself sir or were you
taught to find me The search sir was profitable
and much fool may you find in you even to the
worlds pleasure and the increase of laughter
A good knave i faith and well fed
Madam my lord will go away tonight
A very serious business calls on him
The great prerogative and rite of love
Which as your due time claims he does acknowledge
But puts it off to a compelld restraint
Whose want and whose delay is strewd with sweets
Which they distil now in the curbed time
To make the coming hour oerflow with joy
And pleasure drown the brim
Whats his will else
That you will take your instant leave o the king
And make this haste as your own good proceeding
Strengthend with what apology you think
May make it probable need
What more commands he
That having this obtaind you presently
Attend his further pleasure
In every thing I wait upon his will
I shall report it so
I pray you
Exit PAROLLES
Come sirrah
Exeunt

Yes my lord and of very valiant approof
You have it from his own deliverance
And by other warranted testimony
Then my dial goes not true I took this lark for a bunting
I do assure you my lord he is very great in
knowledge and accordingly valiant
I have then sinned against his experience and
transgressed against his valour and my state that
way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my
heart to repent Here he comes I pray you make
us friends I will pursue the amity
Enter PAROLLES

Given order for our horses and tonight
When I should take possession of the bride
End ere I do begin
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
dinner but one that lies three thirds and uses a
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with should
be once heard and thrice beaten God save you captain
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you monsieur
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lords
displeasure
You have made shift to run into t boots and spurs
and all like him that leaped into the custard and
out of it youll run again rather than suffer
question for your residence
It may be you have mistaken him my lord
And shall do so ever though I took him at s
prayers Fare you well my lord and believe this
of me there can be no kernel in this light nut the
soul of this man is his clothes Trust him not in
matter of heavy consequence I have kept of them
tame and know their natures Farewell monsieur
I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
deserve at my hand but we must do good against evil

Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
For present parting only he desires
Some private speech with you
I shall obey his will
You must not marvel Helen at my course
Which holds not colour with the time nor does
The ministration and required office
On my particular Prepared I was not
For such a business therefore am I found
So much unsettled this drives me to entreat you
That presently you take our way for home
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you
For my respects are better than they seem
And my appointments have in them a need
Greater than shows itself at the first view
To you that know them not This to my mother
Giving a letter
Twill be two days ere I shall see you so
I leave you to your wisdom
Sir I can nothing say
But that I am your most obedient servant
Come come no more of that
And ever shall
With true observance seek to eke out that
Wherein toward me my homely stars have faild
To equal my great fortune
Let that go
My haste is very great farewell hie home
Pray sir your pardon
Well what would you say
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe
Nor dare I say tis mine and yet it is
But like a timorous thief most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own
What would you have
Something and scarce so much nothing indeed
I would not tell you what I would my lord
Faith yes
Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss
I pray you stay not but in haste to horse
I shall not break your bidding good my lord
Where are my other men monsieur Farewell

So that from point to point now have you heard
The fundamental reasons of this war
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after
Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your graces part black and fearful
On the opposer
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers
Good my lord
The reasons of our state I cannot yield
But like a common and an outward man
That the great figure of a council frames
By selfunable motion therefore dare not
Say what I think of it since I have found
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
As often as I guessd
Be it his pleasure
But I am sure the younger of our nature
That surfeit on their ease will day by day
Come here for physic
Welcome shall they be
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle You know your places well
When better fall for your avails they fell

But I do wash his name out of my blood
And thou art all my child Towards Florence is he
Ay madam

Such is his noble purpose and believe t
The duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims
Return you thither
Ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed
Reads  Till I have no wife I have nothing in France
Tis bitter
Find you that there
Ay madam
Tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his
heart was not consenting to
Nothing in France until he have no wife
Theres nothing here that is too good for him
But only she and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress Who was with him
A servant only and a gentleman
Which I have sometime known
Parolles was it not
Ay my good lady he
A very tainted fellow and full of wickedness
My son corrupts a wellderived nature
With his inducement
Indeed good lady
The fellow has a deal of that too much
Which holds him much to have
Youre welcome gentlemen
I will entreat you when you see my son
To tell him that his sword can never win
The honour that he loses more Ill entreat you
Written to bear along
We serve you madam
In that and all your worthiest affairs
Not so but as we change our courtesies
Will you draw near

Nothing in France until he has no wife
Thou shalt have none Rousillon none in France
Then hast thou all again Poor lord ist I
That chase thee from thy country and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the nonesparing war and is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court where thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark
Of smoky muskets O you leaden messengers
That ride upon the violent speed of fire
Fly with false aim move the stillpeering air
That sings with piercing do not touch my lord
Whoever shoots at him I set him there
Whoever charges on his forward breast
I am the caitiff that do hold him tot
And though I kill him not I am the cause
His death was so effected better twere
I met the ravin lion when he roard
With sharp constraint of hunger better twere
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once No come thou home Rousillon
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar
As oft it loses all I will be gone
My being here it is that holds thee hence
Shall I stay here to dot  no no although
The air of paradise did fan the house
And angels officed all I will be gone

Ambitious love hath so in me offended
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon
With sainted vow my faults to have amended
Write write that from the bloody course of war
My dearest master your dear son may hie
Bless him at home in peace whilst I from far
His name with zealous fervor sanctify
His taken labours bid him me forgive
I his despiteful Juno sent him forth
From courtly friends with camping foes to live
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth
He is too good and fair for death and me
Whom I myself embrace to set him free
Ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words
Rinaldo you did never lack advice so much
As letting her pass so had I spoke with her
I could have well diverted her intents
Which thus she hath prevented
Pardon me madam
If I had given you this at overnight
She might have been oertaen and yet she writes
Pursuit would be but vain
What angel shall
Bless this unworthy husband he cannot thrive
Unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear
And loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath
Of greatest justice Write write Rinaldo
To this unworthy husband of his wife
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light my greatest grief
Though little he do feel it set down sharply
Dispatch the most convenient messenger
When haply he shall hear that she is gone
He will return and hope I may that she
Hearing so much will speed her foot again
Led hither by pure love which of them both
Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
To make distinction provide this messenger
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak
Grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak

enticements oaths tokens and all these engines of
lust are not the things they go under many a maid
hath been seduced by them and the misery is
example that so terrible shows in the wreck of
maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade succession
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
them I hope I need not to advise you further but

modesty which is so lost
You shall not need to fear me
I hope so
Enter HELENA disguised like a Pilgrim
Look here comes a pilgrim I know she will lie at

question her God save you pilgrim whither are you bound
To Saint Jaques le Grand
Where do the palmers lodge I do beseech you
At the Saint Francis here beside the port
Is this the way
Ay marry ist
A march afar
Hark you they come this way
If you will tarry holy pilgrim
But till the troops come by
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged
The rather for I think I know your hostess
As ample as myself
Is it yourself
If you shall please so pilgrim
I thank you and will stay upon your leisure
You came I think from France
I did so
Here you shall see a countryman of yours
That has done worthy service
His name I pray you
The Count Rousillon know you such a one
But by the ear that hears most nobly of him
His face I know not
Whatsomeer he is
Hes bravely taken here He stole from France
As tis reported for the king had married him
Against his liking think you it is so
Ay surely mere the truth I know his lady
There is a gentleman that serves the count
Reports but coarsely of her
Whats his name
Monsieur Parolles
O I believe with him
In argument of praise or to the worth
Of the great count himself she is too mean
To have her name repeated all her deserving
Is a reserved honesty and that
I have not heard examined
Alas poor lady
Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
Of a detesting lord
I warrant good creature wheresoeer she is
Her heart weighs sadly this young maid might do her
A shrewd turn if she pleased
How do you mean
May be the amorous count solicits her
In the unlawful purpose
He does indeed
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid
But she is armd for him and keeps her guard
In honestest defence
The gods forbid else
So now they come

Enter BERTRAM PAROLLES and the whole army

I like him well
Tis pity he is not honest yonds that same knave
That leads him to these places were I his lady

Worthy the note
Well take your offer kindly
Exeunt
Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords
Nay good my lord put him tot let him have his
way
If your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no
more in your respect
On my life my lord a bubble
Do you think I am so far deceived in him
Believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
without any malice but to speak of him as my
kinsman hes a most notable coward an infinite and
endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner
of no one good quality worthy your lordships
entertainment
It were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in
his virtue which he hath not he might at some
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you
None better than to let him fetch off his drum
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do
I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly
surprise him such I will have whom I am sure he
knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink
him so that he shall suppose no other but that he
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
we bring him to our own tents Be but your lordship
present at his examination if he do not for the
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the
intelligence in his power against you and that with
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never
trust my judgment in any thing
O for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum
he says he has a stratagem fort when your
lordship sees the bottom of his success int and to
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
melted if you give him not John Drums
entertainment your inclining cannot be removed
Here he comes
Enter PAROLLES
Aside to BERTRAM  O for the love of laughter
hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch
off his drum in any hand
How now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your
disposition
A pox ont let it go tis but a drum
But a drum ist but a drum A drum so lost
There was excellent commandto charge in with our
horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers
That was not to be blamed in the command of the
service it was a disaster of war that Caesar
himself could not have prevented if he had been
there to command
Well we cannot greatly condemn our success some
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is
not to be recovered
It might have been recovered
It might but it is not now
It is to be recovered but that the merit of
performer I would have that drum or another or
hic jacet
Why if you have a stomach tot monsieur if you
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
instrument of honour again into his native quarter
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on I will
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you
speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it
and extend to you what further becomes his
greatness even to the utmost syllable of your
worthiness
By the hand of a soldier I will undertake it
But you must not now slumber in it
Ill about it this evening and I will presently
pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my
certainty put myself into my mortal preparation
and by midnight look to hear further from me
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it
I know not what the success will be my lord but
the attempt I vow
I know thourt valiant and to the possibility of
thy soldiership will subscribe for thee Farewell
I love not many words
Exit
No more than a fish loves water Is not this a
strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems
to undertake this business which he knows is not to
be done damns himself to do and dares better be
damned than to dot
You do not know him my lord as we do certain it
is that he will steal himself into a mans favour and
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but
when you find him out you have him ever after
Why do you think he will make no deed at all of
this that so seriously he does address himself unto
None in the world but return with an invention and
clap upon you two or three probable lies but we
have almost embossed him you shall see his fall
tonight for indeed he is not for your lordships respect
Well make you some sport with the fox ere we case
him He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu
when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a
sprat you shall find him which you shall see this
very night
I must go look my twigs he shall be caught
Your brother he shall go along with me
Ast please your lordship Ill leave you
Exit
Now will I lead you to the house and show you
The lass I spoke of
But you say shes honest
Thats all the fault I spoke with her but once
And found her wondrous cold but I sent to her
By this same coxcomb that we have i the wind
Tokens and letters which she did resend
And this is all I have done Shes a fair creature
Will you go see her
With all my heart my lord
Exeunt
Enter HELENA and Widow
If you misdoubt me that I am not she
I know not how I shall assure you further
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon
Though my estate be fallen I was well born
Nothing acquainted with these businesses
And would not put my reputation now
Nor would I wish you
First give me trust the count he is my husband
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
Is so from word to word and then you cannot
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow
Err in bestowing it
I should believe you
For you have showd me that which well approves
Youre great in fortune
Take this purse of gold
And let me buy your friendly help thus far
Which I will overpay and pay again
When I have found it The count he wooes your daughter
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty
Resolved to carry her let her in fine consent
As well direct her how tis best to bear it
Now his important blood will nought deny
That shell demand a ring the county wears
That downward hath succeeded in his house
From son to son some four or five descents
Since the first father wore it this ring he holds
In most rich choice yet in his idle fire
To buy his will it would not seem too dear
Howeer repented after
Now I see
The bottom of your purpose
You see it lawful then it is no more
But that your daughter ere she seems as won
Desires this ring appoints him an encounter
In fine delivers me to fill the time
Herself most chastely absent after this
To marry her Ill add three thousand crowns
To what is passed already
I have yielded
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever
That time and place with this deceit so lawful
May prove coherent Every night he comes
With musics of all sorts and songs composed
To her unworthiness it nothing steads us
To chide him from our eaves for he persists
As if his life lay ont
Why then tonight
Let us assay our plot which if it speed
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
But lets about it
Exeunt
Enter Second French Lord with five or six other Soldiers in ambush
He can come no other way but by this hedgecorner
When you sally upon him speak what terrible
language you will though you understand it not
yourselves no matter for we must not seem to
understand him unless some one among us whom we
must produce for an interpreter
Good captain let me be the interpreter
Art not acquainted with him knows he not thy voice
No sir I warrant you
But what linseywoolsey hast thou to speak to us again
Een such as you speak to me
He must think us some band of strangers i the
adversarys entertainment Now he hath a smack of
all neighbouring languages therefore we must every
one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we
speak one to another so we seem to know is to
know straight our purpose choughs language
gabble enough and good enough As for you
interpreter you must seem very politic But couch
ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep
and then to return and swear the lies he forges
Enter PAROLLES
Ten oclock within these three hours twill be
time enough to go home What shall I say I have
done It must be a very plausive invention that
carries it they begin to smoke me and disgraces
have of late knocked too often at my door I find
my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the
fear of Mars before it and of his creatures not
daring the reports of my tongue
This is the first truth that eer thine own tongue
was guilty of
What the devil should move me to undertake the
recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the
impossibility and knowing I had no such purpose I
must give myself some hurts and say I got them in
exploit yet slight ones will not carry it they
will say Came you off with so little and great
ones I dare not give Wherefore whats the
instance Tongue I must put you into a
butterwomans mouth and buy myself another of
Bajazets mule if you prattle me into these perils
Is it possible he should know what he is and be
that he is
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
turn or the breaking of my Spanish sword
We cannot afford you so
Or the baring of my beard and to say it was in
stratagem
Twould not do
Or to drown my clothes and say I was stripped
Hardly serve
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel
How deep
Thirty fathom
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed
I would I had any drum of the enemys I would swear
I recovered it
You shall hear one anon
A drum now of the enemys
Alarum within
Throca movousus cargo cargo cargo
Cargo cargo cargo villiando par corbo cargo
O ransom ransom do not hide mine eyes
They seize and blindfold him
Boskos thromuldo boskos
I know you are the Muskos regiment
And I shall lose my life for want of language
If there be here German or Dane low Dutch
Italian or French let him speak to me Ill
Discover that which shall undo the Florentine
Boskos vauvado I understand thee and can speak
thy tongue Kerely bonto sir betake thee to thy
faith for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom
O
O pray pray pray Manka revania dulche

The general is content to spare thee yet
And hoodwinkd as thou art will lead thee on
To gather from thee haply thou mayst inform
Something to save thy life
O let me live
And all the secrets of our camp Ill show
Their force their purposes nay Ill speak that
Which you will wonder at
But wilt thou faithfully
If I do not damn me
Acordo linta
Come on thou art granted space
Exit with PAROLLES guarded A short alarum within
Go tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
We have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled
Till we do hear from them
Captain I will
A will betray us all unto ourselves
Inform on that
So I will sir
Till then Ill keep him dark and safely lockd
Exeunt
Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
They told me that your name was Fontibell
No my good lord Diana
Titled goddess
And worth it with addition But fair soul
In your fine frame hath love no quality
If quick fire of youth light not your mind
You are no maiden but a monument
When you are dead you should be such a one
As you are now for you are cold and stem
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got
She then was honest
So should you be
No
My mother did but duty such my lord
As you owe to your wife
No more o that
I prithee do not strive against my vows
I was compelld to her but I love thee
By loves own sweet constraint and will for ever
Do thee all rights of service
Ay so you serve us
Till we serve you but when you have our roses
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
And mock us with our bareness
How have I sworn
Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
But the plain single vow that is vowd true
What is not holy that we swear not by
But take the Highst to witness then pray you tell me
If I should swear by Gods great attributes
I loved you dearly would you believe my oaths
When I did love you ill This has no holding
To swear by him whom I protest to love
That I will work against him therefore your oaths
Are words and poor conditions but unseald
At least in my opinion
Change it change it
Be not so holycruel love is holy
And my integrity neer knew the crafts
That you do charge men with Stand no more off
But give thyself unto my sick desires
Who then recover say thou art mine and ever
My love as it begins shall so persever
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
That well forsake ourselves Give me that ring
Ill lend it thee my dear but have no power
To give it from me
Will you not my lord
It is an honour longing to our house
Bequeathed down from many ancestors
Which were the greatest obloquy i the world
In me to lose
Mine honours such a ring
My chastitys the jewel of our house
Bequeathed down from many ancestors
Which were the greatest obloquy i the world
In me to lose thus your own proper wisdom
Brings in the champion Honour on my part
Against your vain assault
Here take my ring
My house mine honour yea my life be thine
And Ill be bid by thee
When midnight comes knock at my chamberwindow
Ill order take my mother shall not hear
Now will I charge you in the band of truth
When you have conquerd my yet maiden bed
Remain there but an hour nor speak to me
My reasons are most strong and you shall know them
When back again this ring shall be deliverd
And on your finger in the night Ill put
Another ring that what in time proceeds
May token to the future our past deeds
Adieu till then then fail not You have won
A wife of me though there my hope be done
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee
Exit
For which live long to thank both heaven and me
You may so in the end
My mother told me just how he would woo
As if she sat in s heart she says all men
Have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me
When his wifes dead therefore Ill lie with him
When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid
Marry that will I live and die a maid
Only in this disguise I thinkt no sin
To cozen him that would unjustly win
Exit
Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers
You have not given him his mothers letter
I have delivered it an hour since there is
something int that stings his nature for on the
reading it he changed almost into another man
He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady
Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
displeasure of the king who had even tuned his
bounty to sing happiness to him I will tell you a
thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you
When you have spoken it tis dead and I am the
grave of it
He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
Florence of a most chaste renown and this night he
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath
given her his monumental ring and thinks himself
made in the unchaste composition
Now God delay our rebellion as we are ourselves
what things are we
Merely our own traitors And as in the common course
of all treasons we still see them reveal
themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends
nobility in his proper stream oerflows himself
Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of
our unlawful intents We shall not then have his
company tonight
Not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
That approaches apace I would gladly have him see
his company anatomized that he might take a measure
of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had
set this counterfeit
We will not meddle with him till he come for his
presence must be the whip of the other
In the mean time what hear you of these wars
I hear there is an overture of peace
Nay I assure you a peace concluded
What will Count Rousillon do then will he travel
higher or return again into France
I perceive by this demand you are not altogether
of his council
Let it be forbid sir so should I be a great deal
Sir his wife some two months since fled from his
house her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
le Grand which holy undertaking with most austere
sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and
now she sings in heaven
How is this justified
The stronger part of it by her own letters which
makes her story true even to the point of her
death her death itself which could not be her
office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by
the rector of the place
Hath the count all this intelligence
Ay and the particular confirmations point from
point so to the full arming of the verity
I am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses
And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
in tears The great dignity that his valour hath
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
with a shame as ample
The web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and
ill together our virtues would be proud if our
faults whipped them not and our crimes would
despair if they were not cherished by our virtues
Enter a Messenger
How now wheres your master
He met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath
taken a solemn leave his lordship will next
morning for France The duke hath offered him
letters of commendations to the king

hear of it hereafter But shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier Come
bring forth this counterfeit module he has deceived

Bring him forth has sat i the stocks all night
poor gallant knave
No matter his heels have deserved it in usurping
his spurs so long How does he carry himself
I have told your lordship already the stocks carry
him But to answer you as you would be understood
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he
hath confessed himself to Morgan whom he supposes
to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to
this very instant disaster of his setting i the
stocks and what think you he hath confessed
Nothing of me has a
His confession is taken and it shall be read to his
face if your lordship be int as I believe you

And truly as I hope to live
Reads  First demand of him how many horse the
duke is strong What say you to that
Five or six thousand but very weak and
unserviceable the troops are all scattered and
the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation
and credit and as I hope to live
Shall I set down your answer so
Do Ill take the sacrament ont how and which way you will
Alls one to him What a pastsaving slave is this
Youre deceived my lord this is Monsieur
Parolles the gallant militaristthat was his own
phrasethat had the whole theoric of war in the
his dagger
I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean nor believe he can have every thing in him
by wearing his apparel neatly
Well thats set down
Five or six thousand horse I said I will say
trueor thereabouts set down for Ill speak truth
Hes very near the truth in this
But I con him no thanks fort in the nature he
delivers it
Poor rogues I pray you say
Well thats set down
I humbly thank you sir a truths a truth the
rogues are marvellous poor
Reads  Demand of him of what strength they are
afoot What say you to that
By my troth sir if I were to live this present
hour I will tell true Let me see Spurio a
hundred and fifty Sebastian so many Corambus so
many Jaques so many Guiltian Cosmo Lodowick
and Gratii two hundred and fifty each mine own
company Chitopher Vaumond Bentii two hundred and
fifty each so that the musterfile rotten and
sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand
poll half of the which dare not shake snow from off
their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces
What shall be done to him
Nothing but let him have thanks Demand of him my
condition and what credit I have with the duke
Well thats set down
Reads
You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumain
be i the camp a Frenchman what his reputation is
with the duke what his valour honesty and
expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not
possible with wellweighing sums of gold to
corrupt him to revolt What say you to this what
do you know of it
I beseech you let me answer to the particular of
the intergatories demand them singly
Do you know this Captain Dumain
I know him a was a botchers prentice in Paris
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieves
fool with childa dumb innocent that could not
say him nay
Nay by your leave hold your hands though I know
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls
Well is this captain in the duke of Florences camp
Upon my knowledge he is and lousy
Nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your
lordship anon
What is his reputation with the duke
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him
out o the band I think I have his letter in my pocket
Marry well search
In good sadness I do not know either it is there
or it is upon a file with the dukes other letters
in my tent
Here tis heres a paper shall I read it to you
I do not know if it be it or no
Our interpreter does it well
Excellently
Reads  Dian the counts a fool and full of gold
That is not the dukes letter sir that is an
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence one
Diana to take heed of the allurement of one Count
Rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very
ruttish I pray you sir put it up again
Nay Ill read it first by your favour
My meaning int I protest was very honest in the
behalf of the maid for I knew the young count to be
a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds
Damnable bothsides rogue
Reads  When he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it
After he scores he never pays the score
Half won is match well made match and well make it
He neer pays afterdebts take it before
And say a soldier Dian told thee this
Men are to mell with boys are not to kiss
For count of this the counts a fool I know it
Who pays before but not when he does owe it
Thine as he vowed to thee in thine ear
PAROLLES
He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
ins forehead
This is your devoted friend sir the manifold
linguist and the armipotent soldier
I could endure any thing before but a cat and now
hes a cat to me
I perceive sir by the generals looks we shall be
fain to hang you
My life sir in any case not that I am afraid to
die but that my offences being many I would
repent out the remainder of nature let me live
sir in a dungeon i the stocks or any where so I may live
Well see what may be done so you confess freely
therefore once more to this Captain Dumain you
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
his valour what is his honesty
He will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus he
professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he
is stronger than Hercules he will lie sir with
such volubility that you would think truth were a
fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will
be swinedrunk and in his sleep he does little
harm save to his bedclothes about him but they
know his conditions and lay him in straw I have but
little more to say sir of his honesty he has
every thing that an honest man should not have what
an honest man should have he has nothing
I begin to love him for this
For this description of thine honesty A pox upon
him for me hes more and more a cat
What say you to his expertness in war
Faith sir he has led the drum before the English
tragedians to belie him I will not and more of
his soldiership I know not except in that country
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
called Mileend to instruct for the doubling of
files I would do the man what honour I can but of
this I am not certain
He hath outvillained villany so far that the
rarity redeems him
A pox on him hes a cat still
His qualities being at this poor price I need not
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
Sir for a quart decu he will sell the feesimple
of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the
entail from all remainders and a perpetual
succession for it perpetually
Whats his brother the other Captain Dumain
Why does be ask him of me
Whats he
Een a crow o the same nest not altogether so
great as the first in goodness but greater a great
deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is
in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming
on he has the cramp
If your life be saved will you undertake to betray
the Florentine
Ay and the captain of his horse Count Rousillon
Ill whisper with the general and know his pleasure
Aside  Ill no more drumming a plague of all
drums Only to seem to deserve well and to
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
the count have I run into this danger Yet who
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken
There is no remedy sir but you must die the
general says you that have so traitorously
discovered the secrets of your army and made such
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can
serve the world for no honest use therefore you
must die Come headsman off with his head
O Lord sir let me live or let me see my death
That shall you and take your leave of all your friends
Unblinding him
So look about you know you any here
Good morrow noble captain
God bless you Captain Parolles
God save you noble captain
Captain what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu
I am for France
Good captain will you give me a copy of the sonnet
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon
an I were not a very coward Ild compel it of you
but fare you well
Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords

impudent nation Fare ye well sir I am for France

Exit with Soldiers
Yet am I thankful if my heart were great
Twould burst at this Captain Ill be no more
But I will eat and drink and sleep as soft
As captain shall simply the thing I am
Shall make me live Who knows himself a braggart
Let him fear this for it will come to pass
that every braggart shall be found an ass
Rust sword cool blushes and Parolles live
Safest in shame being foold by foolery thrive
Theres place and means for every man alive
Ill after them

Dear almost as his life which gratitude
Through flinty Tartars bosom would peep forth
And answer thanks I duly am informd
His grace is at Marseilles to which place
We have convenient convoy You must know
I am supposed dead the army breaking
My husband hies him home where heaven aiding
And by the leave of my good lord the king
Well be before our welcome
Gentle madam
You never had a servant to whose trust
Your business was more welcome
Nor you mistress
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
To recompense your love doubt not but heaven
Hath brought me up to be your daughters dower
As it hath fated her to be my motive
And helper to a husband But O strange men
That can such sweet use make of what they hate
When saucy trusting of the cozend thoughts
Defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play
With what it loathes for that which is away
But more of this hereafter You Diana
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
Something in my behalf
Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions I am yours
Upon your will to suffer
Yet I pray you
But with the word the time will bring on summer
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
And be as sweet as sharp We must away
Our wagon is prepared and time revives us
Alls well that ends well still the fines the crown
Whateer the course the end is the renown

by the king than by that redtailed humblebee I speak of
I would I had not known him it was the death of the
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
praise for creating If she had partaken of my
flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother I
could not have owed her a more rooted love
Twas a good lady twas a good lady we may pick a

Indeed sir she was the sweet marjoram of the
salad or rather the herb of grace
They are not herbs you knave they are noseherbs
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar sir I have not much
skill in grass
Whether dost thou profess thyself a knave or a fool
A fool sir at a womans service and a knave at a mans

So you were a knave at his service indeed
And I would give his wife my bauble sir to do her service

At your service
No no no
Why sir if I cannot serve you I can serve as
great a prince as you are

What prince is that
The black prince sir alias the prince of
darkness alias the devil
Hold thee theres my purse I give thee not this

I am a woodland fellow sir that always loved a
great fire and the master I speak of ever keeps a
good fire But sure he is the prince of the
world let his nobility remain ins court I am for
the house with the narrow gate which I take to be
too little for pomp to enter some that humble
themselves may but the many will be too chill and
tender and theyll be for the flowery way that
leads to the broad gate and the great fire
Go thy ways I begin to be aweary of thee and I
tell thee so before because I would not fall out
with thee Go thy ways let my horses be well
looked to without any tricks

first propose his highness hath promised me to do
it and to stop up the displeasure he hath
conceived against your son there is no fitter
matter How does your ladyship like it
With very much content my lord and I wish it
happily effected
His highness comes post from Marseilles of as able
body as when he numbered thirty he will be here
tomorrow or I am deceived by him that in such
intelligence hath seldom failed
It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I
die I have letters that my son will be here
tonight I shall beseech your lordship to remain

Flourish Enter KING COUNTESS LAFEU the two French Lords with Attendants
We lost a jewel of her and our esteem
Was made much poorer by it but your son
As mad in folly lackd the sense to know
Her estimation home
Tis past my liege
And I beseech your majesty to make it
Natural rebellion done i the blaze of youth
When oil and fire too strong for reasons force
Oerbears it and burns on
My honourd lady
I have forgiven and forgotten all
Though my revenges were high bent upon him
And watchd the time to shoot
This I must say
But first I beg my pardon the young lord
Did to his majesty his mother and his lady
Offence of mighty note but to himself
The greatest wrong of all He lost a wife
Whose beauty did astonish the survey
Of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
Whose dear perfection hearts that scornd to serve
Humbly calld mistress
Praising what is lost
Makes the remembrance dear Well call him hither
We are reconciled and the first view shall kill
All repetition let him not ask our pardon
The nature of his great offence is dead
And deeper than oblivion we do bury
The incensing relics of it let him approach
A stranger no offender and inform him
So tis our will he should
I shall my liege

He looks well ont
I am not a day of season
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
In me at once but to the brightest beams
The time is fair again
My highrepented blames
Dear sovereign pardon to me
All is whole
Not one word more of the consumed time
Lets take the instant by the forward top
For we are old and on our quickst decrees
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
Steals ere we can effect them You remember
The daughter of this lord
Admiringly my liege at first
I stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
Where the impression of mine eye infixing
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
Which warpd the line of every other favour
Scornd a fair colour or expressd it stolen
To a most hideous object thence it came
That she whom all men praised and whom myself
Since I have lost have loved was in mine eye
The dust that did offend it
Well excused
That thou didst love her strikes some scores away
From the great compt but love that comes too late
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
To the great sender turns a sour offence
Crying Thats good thats gone Our rash faults
Make trivial price of serious things we have
Not knowing them until we know their grave
Oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
Our own love waking cries to see whats done
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon
Be this sweet Helens knell and now forget her
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin
The main consents are had and here well stay
To see our widowers second marriageday
Which better than the first O dear heaven bless
Or ere they meet in me O nature cesse
Come on my son in whom my houses name
Must be digested give a favour from you
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
That she may quickly come
BERTRAM gives a ring
By my old beard
And every hair thats ont Helen thats dead
Was a sweet creature such a ring as this
The last that eer I took her at court
I saw upon her finger
Hers it was not
Now pray you let me see it for mine eye
While I was speaking oft was fastend tot
This ring was mine and when I gave it Helen
I bade her if her fortunes ever stood
Necessitied to help that by this token
I would relieve her Had you that craft to reave
her
Of what should stead her most
My gracious sovereign
Howeer it pleases you to take it so
The ring was never hers
Son on my life
I have seen her wear it and she reckond it
At her lifes rate
I am sure I saw her wear it
You are deceived my lord she never saw it
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me
Wrappd in a paper which containd the name
Of her that threw it noble she was and thought
I stood engaged but when I had subscribed
To mine own fortune and informd her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
As she had made the overture she ceased
Receive the ring again
Plutus himself
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine
Hath not in natures mystery more science
Than I have in this ring twas mine twas Helens
Whoever gave it you Then if you know
That you are well acquainted with yourself
Confess twas hers and by what rough enforcement
You got it from her she calld the saints to surety
That she would never put it from her finger
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed
Where you have never come or sent it us
Upon her great disaster
She never saw it
Thou speakst it falsely as I love mine honour
And makest conjectural fears to come into me
Which I would fain shut out If it should prove
That thou art so inhumantwill not prove so
And yet I know not thou didst hate her deadly
And she is dead which nothing but to close
Her eyes myself could win me to believe
More than to see this ring Take him away
Guards seize BERTRAM
My forepast proofs howeer the matter fall
Shall tax my fears of little vanity
Having vainly feard too little Away with him
Well sift this matter further
If you shall prove
This ring was ever hers you shall as easy
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence
Where yet she never was
Exit guarded
I am wrappd in dismal thinkings
Enter a Gentleman
Gracious sovereign
Whether I have been to blame or no I know not
Heres a petition from a Florentine
Who hath for four or five removes come short
To tender it herself I undertook it
Vanquishd thereto by the fair grace and speech
Of the poor suppliant who by this I know
Is here attending her business looks in her
With an importing visage and she told me
In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
Your highness with herself
Reads  Upon his many protestations to marry me
when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won
me Now is the Count Rousillon a widower his vows
are forfeited to me and my honours paid to him He
stole from Florence taking no leave and I follow
him to his country for justice grant it me O
king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer
flourishes and a poor maid is undone
DIANA CAPILET
I will buy me a soninlaw in a fair and toll for
this Ill none of him
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu
To bring forth this discovery Seek these suitors
Go speedily and bring again the count
I am afeard the life of Helen lady
Was foully snatchd
Now justice on the doers
Reenter BERTRAM guarded
I wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship
Yet you desire to marry
Enter Widow and DIANA
What womans that
I am my lord a wretched Florentine
Derived from the ancient Capilet
My suit as I do understand you know
And therefore know how far I may be pitied
I am her mother sir whose age and honour
Both suffer under this complaint we bring
And both shall cease without your remedy
Come hither count do you know these women
My lord I neither can nor will deny
But that I know them do they charge me further
Why do you look so strange upon your wife
Shes none of mine my lord
If you shall marry
You give away this hand and that is mine
You give away heavens vows and those are mine
You give away myself which is known mine
For I by vow am so embodied yours
That she which marries you must marry me
Either both or none
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter you
are no husband for her
My lord this is a fond and desperate creature
Whom sometime I have laughd with let your highness
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here
Sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
Till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour
Than in my thought it lies
Good my lord
Ask him upon his oath if he does think
He had not my virginity
What sayst thou to her
Shes impudent my lord
And was a common gamester to the camp
He does me wrong my lord if I were so
He might have bought me at a common price
Do not believe him O behold this ring
Whose high respect and rich validity
Did lack a parallel yet for all that
He gave it to a commoner o the camp
If I be one
He blushes and tis it
Of six preceding ancestors that gem
Conferrd by testament to the sequent issue
Hath it been owed and worn This is his wife
That rings a thousand proofs
Methought you said
You saw one here in court could witness it
I did my lord but loath am to produce
So bad an instrument his names Parolles
I saw the man today if man he be
Find him and bring him hither
Exit an Attendant
What of him
Hes quoted for a most perfidious slave
With all the spots o the world taxd and deboshd
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
Am I or that or this for what hell utter
That will speak any thing
She hath that ring of yours
I think she has certain it is I liked her
And boarded her i the wanton way of youth
She knew her distance and did angle for me
Madding my eagerness with her restraint
As all impediments in fancys course
Are motives of more fancy and in fine
Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
Subdued me to her rate she got the ring
And I had that which any inferior might
At marketprice have bought
I must be patient
You that have turnd off a first so noble wife
May justly diet me I pray you yet
Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband
Send for your ring I will return it home
And give me mine again
I have it not
What ring was yours I pray you
Sir much like
The same upon your finger
Know you this ring this ring was his of late
And this was it I gave him being abed
The story then goes false you threw it him
Out of a casement
I have spoke the truth
Enter PAROLLES
My lord I do confess the ring was hers
You boggle shrewdly every feather stars you
Is this the man you speak of
Ay my lord
Tell me sirrah but tell me true I charge you
Not fearing the displeasure of your master
Which on your just proceeding Ill keep off
By him and by this woman here what know you
So please your majesty my master hath been an
honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him
which gentlemen have
Come come to the purpose did he love this woman
Faith sir he did love her but how
How I pray you
He did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman
How is that
He loved her sir and loved her not
As thou art a knave and no knave What an
equivocal companion is this
I am a poor man and at your majestys command
Hes a good drum my lord but a naughty orator
Do you know he promised me marriage
Faith I know more than Ill speak
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest
Yes so please your majesty I did go between them
as I said but more than that he loved her for
indeed he was mad for her and talked of Satan and
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what yet I
was in that credit with them at that time that I
knew of their going to bed and of other motions
as promising her marriage and things which would
derive me ill will to speak of therefore I will not
speak what I know
Thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say
they are married but thou art too fine in thy
evidence therefore stand aside
This ring you say was yours
Ay my good lord
Where did you buy it or who gave it you
It was not given me nor I did not buy it
Who lent it you
It was not lent me neither
Where did you find it then
I found it not
If it were yours by none of all these ways
How could you give it him
I never gave it him
This womans an easy glove my lord she goes off
and on at pleasure
This ring was mine I gave it his first wife
It might be yours or hers for aught I know
Take her away I do not like her now
To prison with her and away with him
Unless thou tellst me where thou hadst this ring
Thou diest within this hour
Ill never tell you
Take her away
Ill put in bail my liege
I think thee now some common customer
By Jove if ever I knew man twas you
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while
Because hes guilty and he is not guilty
He knows I am no maid and hell swear tot
Ill swear I am a maid and he knows not
Great king I am no strumpet by my life
I am either maid or else this old mans wife
She does abuse our ears to prison with her
Good mother fetch my bail Stay royal sir
Exit Widow
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
And he shall surety me But for this lord
Who hath abused me as he knows himself
Though yet he never harmd me here I quit him
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled
And at that time he got his wife with child
Dead though she be she feels her young one kick
So theres my riddle one thats dead is quick
And now behold the meaning
Reenter Widow with HELENA
Is there no exorcist
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes
Ist real that I see
No my good lord
Tis but the shadow of a wife you see
The name and not the thing
Both both O pardon
O my good lord when I was like this maid
I found you wondrous kind There is your ring
And look you heres your letter this it says
When from my finger you can get this ring
And are by me with child  and c This is done
Will you be mine now you are doubly won
If she my liege can make me know this clearly
Ill love her dearly ever ever dearly
If it appear not plain and prove untrue
Deadly divorce step between me and you
O my dear mother do I see you living
Mine eyes smell onions I shall weep anon
To PAROLLES
Good Tom Drum lend me a handkercher so
I thank thee wait on me home Ill make sport with thee
Let thy courtesies alone they are scurvy ones
Let us from point to point this story know
To make the even truth in pleasure flow
To DIANA
If thou best yet a fresh uncropped flower
Choose thou thy husband and Ill pay thy dower
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Thou keepst a wife herself thyself a maid
Of that and all the progress more or less
Resolvedly more leisure shall express
All yet seems well and if it end so meet
The bitter past more welcome is the sweet
Flourish
EPILOGUE
The kings a beggar now the play is done
All is well ended if this suit be won
That you express content which we will pay
With strife to please you day exceeding day
Ours be your patience then and yours our parts
Your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
blessing to breed me well and there begins my
sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and
report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses
are bred better for besides that they are fair
with their feeding they are taught their manage
and to that end riders dearly hired but I his
brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
brother and as much as in him lies mines my
gentility with my education This is it Adam that
grieves me and the spirit of my father which I
think is within me begins to mutiny against this
servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I
know no wise remedy how to avoid it
Yonder comes my master your brother
Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will
shake me up
Enter OLIVER
Now sir what make you here
Nothing I am not taught to make any thing
What mar you then sir
Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God
made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness
Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them
What prodigal portion have I spent that I should
come to such penury
Know you where your are sir
O sir very well here in your orchard
Know you before whom sir
Ay better than him I am before knows me I know
you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
condition of blood you should so know me The
courtesy of nations allows you my better in that
you are the firstborn but the same tradition
takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers
betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as
you albeit I confess your coming before me is
nearer to his reverence
What boy
Come come elder brother you are too young in this
Wilt thou lay hands on me villain
I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir
Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice
a villain that says such a father begot villains
Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself
Sweet masters be patient for your fathers
remembrance be at accord
Let me go I say
I will not till I please you shall hear me My
father charged you in his will to give me good
education you have trained me like a peasant
obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in
me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow
me such exercises as may become a gentleman or
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
testament with that I will go buy my fortunes
And what wilt thou do beg when that is spent
Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled
with you you shall have some part of your will I
pray you leave me

So please you he is here at the door and importunes
access to you
Call him in
Exit DENNIS
Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is
Enter CHARLES
Good morrow to your worship
Good Monsieur Charles whats the new news at the
new court
Theres no news at the court sir but the old news
that is the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
therefore he gives them good leave to wander
Can you tell if Rosalind the dukes daughter be
banished with her father
O no for the dukes daughter her cousin so loves
her being ever from their cradles bred together
that she would have followed her exile or have died
to stay behind her She is at the court and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
never two ladies loved as they do
Where will the old duke live
They say he is already in the forest of Arden and
a many merry men with him and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
carelessly as they did in the golden world
What you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke
Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a
matter I am given sir secretly to understand
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall
Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well Your brother is but young and tender and
for your love I would be loath to foil him as I
must for my own honour if he come in therefore
out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you
withal that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will
Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had
myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full
of ambition an envious emulator of every mans
good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
me his natural brother therefore use thy
discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
against thee by poison entrap thee by some
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak
it there is not one so young and so villanous this
day living I speak but brotherly of him but
should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come
tomorrow Ill give him his payment if ever he go
alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more and
so God keep your worship
Farewell good Charles
Exit CHARLES
Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see
an end of him for my soul yet I know not why
hates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never
schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
in the heart of the world and especially of my own
people who best know him that I am altogether
misprised but it shall not be so long this
wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about

I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry
Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of
and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father
had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
hadst been still with me I could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee
Well I will forget the condition of my estate to
rejoice in yours
You know my father hath no child but I nor none is
like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce I will render thee again in
affection by mine honour I will and when I break
that oath let me turn monster therefore my
sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry
From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let
me see what think you of falling in love
Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but
love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again
What shall be our sport then
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
I would we could do so for her benefits are
mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women
Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest and those that she makes honest she
makes very illfavouredly
Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to
Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world
not in the lineaments of Nature
Enter TOUCHSTONE
No when Nature hath made a fair creature may she
not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when
Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of
Natures wit
Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but
Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits How now
wit whither wander you
Mistress you must come away to your father
Were you made the messenger
No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you
Where learned you that oath fool
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught now Ill stand to it the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
yet was not the knight forsworn
How prove you that in the great heap of your
knowledge
Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
swear by your beards that I am a knave
By our beards if we had them thou art
By my knavery if I had it then I were but if you
swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard
Prithee who ist that thou meanest
One that old Frederick your father loves
My fathers love is enough to honour him enough
speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation
one of these days
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly
By my troth thou sayest true for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show Here comes

With his mouth full of news
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
Then shall we be newscrammed
All the better we shall be the more marketable
Enter LE BEAU
Bon jour Monsieur Le Beau whats the news
Fair princess you have lost much good sport
Sport of what colour
What colour madam how shall I answer you
As wit and fortune will
Or as the Destinies decree
Well said that was laid on with a trowel
Nay if I keep not my rank
Thou losest thy old smell
You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good
wrestling which you have lost the sight of
You tell us the manner of the wrestling
I will tell you the beginning and if it please
your ladyships you may see the end for the best is
yet to do and here where you are they are coming
to perform it
Well the beginning that is dead and buried
There comes an old man and his three sons
I could match this beginning with an old tale
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
With bills on their necks Be it known unto all men
by these presents
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the
dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs that there is little
hope of life in him so he served the second and
so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man
their father making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping
Alas
But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies
have lost
Why this that I speak of
Thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies
Or I I promise thee
But is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides is there yet another dotes upon
ribbreaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin
You must if you stay here for here is the place
appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to
perform it
Yonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see it
Flourish Enter DUKE FREDERICK Lords ORLANDO CHARLES and Attendants
Come on since the youth will not be entreated his
own peril on his forwardness
Is yonder the man
Even he madam
Alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
How now daughter and cousin are you crept hither
to see the wrestling
Ay my liege so please you give us leave
You will take little delight in it I can tell you
there is such odds in the man In pity of the
challengers youth I would fain dissuade him but he
will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if
you can move him
Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau
Do so Ill not be by
Monsieur the challenger the princesses call for you
I attend them with all respect and duty
Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler
No fair princess he is the general challenger I
come but in as others do to try with him the
strength of my youth
Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your
years You have seen cruel proof of this mans
strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise We pray you for your own sake to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt
Do young sir your reputation shall not therefore
be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward
I beseech you punish me not with your hard
thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny
so fair and excellent ladies any thing But let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one
shamed that was never gracious if killed but one
dead that was willing to be so I shall do my
friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the
world no injury for in it I have nothing only in
the world I fill up a place which may be better
supplied when I have made it empty
The little strength that I have I would it were with you
And mine to eke out hers
Fare you well pray heaven I be deceived in you
Your hearts desires be with you
Come where is this young gallant that is so
desirous to lie with his mother earth
Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
You shall try but one fall
No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him
to a second that have so mightily persuaded him
from a first
An you mean to mock me after you should not have
mocked me before but come your ways
Now Hercules be thy speed young man
I would I were invisible to catch the strong
fellow by the leg
They wrestle
O excellent young man
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who
should down
Shout CHARLES is thrown
No more no more
Yes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathed
How dost thou Charles
He cannot speak my lord
Bear him away What is thy name young man
Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys
I would thou hadst been son to some man else
The world esteemd thy father honourable
But I did find him still mine enemy
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
Hadst thou descended from another house
But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
I would thou hadst told me of another father
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK train and LE BEAU
Were I my father coz would I do this
I am more proud to be Sir Rowlands son
His youngest son and would not change that calling
To be adopted heir to Frederick
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul
And all the world was of my fathers mind
Had I before known this young man his son
I should have given him tears unto entreaties
Ere he should thus have ventured
Gentle cousin
Let us go thank him and encourage him
My fathers rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart Sir you have well deserved
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly as you have exceeded all promise
Your mistress shall be happy
Gentleman
Giving him a chain from her neck
Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
That could give more but that her hand lacks means
Shall we go coz
Ay Fare you well fair gentleman
Can I not say I thank you My better parts
Are all thrown down and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
He calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes
Ill ask him what he would Did you call sir
Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies
Will you go coz
Have with you Fare you well
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
I cannot speak to her yet she urged conference
O poor Orlando thou art overthrown
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee
Reenter LE BEAU
Good sir I do in friendship counsel you
To leave this place Albeit you have deserved
High commendation true applause and love
Yet such is now the dukes condition
That he misconstrues all that you have done
The duke is humorous what he is indeed
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of
I thank you sir and pray you tell me this
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling
Neither his daughter if we judge by manners
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
The other is daughter to the banishd duke
And here detaind by her usurping uncle
To keep his daughter company whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
But I can tell you that of late this duke
Hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good fathers sake
And on my life his malice gainst the lady
Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well
Hereafter in a better world than this
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you
I rest much bounden to you fare you well
Exit LE BEAU
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother

Exit
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy not a word
Not one to throw at a dog
No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
Then there were two cousins laid up when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any
But is all this for your father
No some of it is for my childs father O how
full of briers is this workingday world
They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in
holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them
I could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart
Hem them away
I would try if I could cry hem and have him
Come come wrestle with thy affections
O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
O a good wish upon you you will try in time in
despite of a fall But turning these jests out of
service let us talk in good earnest is it
possible on such a sudden you should fall into so
strong a liking with old Sir Rowlands youngest son
The duke my father loved his father dearly
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly By this kind of chase I should hate him
for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate
not Orlando
No faith hate him not for my sake
Why should I not doth he not deserve well
Let me love him for that and do you love him
because I do Look here comes the duke
With his eyes full of anger
Enter DUKE FREDERICK with Lords
Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
And get you from our court
Me uncle
You cousin
Within these ten days if that thou best found
So near our public court as twenty miles
Thou diest for it
I do beseech your grace
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires
If that I do not dream or be not frantic
As I do trust I am notthen dear uncle
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness
Thus do all traitors
If their purgation did consist in words
They are as innocent as grace itself
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends
Thou art thy fathers daughter theres enough
So was I when your highness took his dukedom
So was I when your highness banishd him
Treason is not inherited my lord
Or if we did derive it from our friends
Whats that to me my father was no traitor
Then good my liege mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous
Dear sovereign hear me speak
Ay Celia we stayd her for your sake
Else had she with her father ranged along
I did not then entreat to have her stay
It was your pleasure and your own remorse
I was too young that time to value her
But now I know her if she be a traitor
Why so am I we still have slept together
Rose at an instant learnd playd eat together
And wheresoever we went like Junos swans
Still we went coupled and inseparable
She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
Her very silence and her patience
Speak to the people and they pity her
Thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone Then open not thy lips
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have passd upon her she is banishd
Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
I cannot live out of her company
You are a fool You niece provide yourself
If you outstay the time upon mine honour
And in the greatness of my word you die
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords
O my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou go
Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine
I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am
I have more cause
Thou hast not cousin
Prithee be cheerful knowst thou not the duke
Hath banishd me his daughter
That he hath not
No hath not Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
Shall we be sunderd shall we part sweet girl
No let my father seek another heir
Therefore devise with me how we may fly
Whither to go and what to bear with us
And do not seek to take your change upon you
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
Say what thou canst Ill go along with thee
Why whither shall we go
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden
Alas what danger will it be to us
Maids as we are to travel forth so far
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
Ill put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face
The like do you so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants
Were it not better
Because that I am more than common tall
That I did suit me all points like a man
A gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh
A boarspear in my hand andin my heart
Lie there what hidden womans fear there will
Well have a swashing and a martial outside
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances
What shall I call thee when thou art a man
Ill have no worse a name than Joves own page
And therefore look you call me Ganymede
But what will you be calld
Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia but Aliena
But cousin what if we assayd to steal
The clownish fool out of your fathers court
Would he not be a comfort to our travel
Hell go along oer the wide world with me
Leave me alone to woo him Lets away
And get our jewels and our wealth together
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment
Exeunt
Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and two or three Lords like foresters
Now my comates and brothers in exile
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam
The seasons difference as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winters wind
Which when it bites and blows upon my body
Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say
This is no flattery these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am
Sweet are the uses of adversity
Which like the toad ugly and venomous
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
Sermons in stones and good in every thing
I would not change it
Happy is your grace
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style
Come shall we go and kill us venison
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
Being native burghers of this desert city
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored
Indeed my lord
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that
And in that kind swears you do more usurp
Than doth your brother that hath banishd you
Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood
To the which place a poor sequesterd stag
That from the hunters aim had taen a hurt
Did come to languish and indeed my lord
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting and the big round tears
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
Augmenting it with tears
But what said Jaques
Did he not moralize this spectacle
O yes into a thousand similes
First for his weeping into the needless stream
Poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
As worldlings do giving thy sum of more
To that which had too much then being there alone
Left and abandond of his velvet friends
Tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
The flux of company anon a careless herd
Full of the pasture jumps along by him
And never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques
Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
Tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
The body of the country city court
Yea and of this our life swearing that we
Are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse
To fright the animals and to kill them up
In their assignd and native dwellingplace
And did you leave him in this contemplation
We did my lord weeping and commenting
Upon the sobbing deer
Show me the place
I love to cope him in these sullen fits
For then hes full of matter
Ill bring you to him straight
Exeunt
Enter DUKE FREDERICK with Lords
Can it be possible that no man saw them
It cannot be some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this
I cannot hear of any that did see her
The ladies her attendants of her chamber
Saw her abed and in the morning early
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress
My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
Your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
Hisperia the princess gentlewoman
Confesses that she secretly oerheard
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles
And she believes wherever they are gone
That youth is surely in their company
Send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
If he be absent bring his brother to me
Ill make him find him do this suddenly
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways
Exeunt
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting
Whos there
What my young master O my gentle master
O my sweet master O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland why what make you here
Why are you virtuous why do people love you
And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny priser of the humorous duke
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
Know you not master to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies
No more do yours your virtues gentle master
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you
O what a world is this when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it
Why whats the matter
O unhappy youth
Come not within these doors within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives
Your brotherno no brother yet the son
Yet not the son I will not call him son
Of him I was about to call his father
Hath heard your praises and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
And you within it if he fail of that
He will have other means to cut you off
This is no place this house is but a butchery
Abhor it fear it do not enter it
Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go
No matter whither so you come not here
What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road
This I must do or know not what to do
Yet this I will not do do how I can
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother
But do not so I have five hundred crowns
The thrifty hire I saved under your father
Which I did store to be my fosternurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown
Take that and He that doth the ravens feed
Yea providently caters for the sparrow
Be comfort to my age Here is the gold
And all this I give you Let me be your servant
Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter
Frosty but kindly let me go with you
Ill do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities
O good old man how well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world
When service sweat for duty not for meed
Thou art not for the fashion of these times
Where none will sweat but for promotion
And having that do choke their service up
Even with the having it is not so with thee
But poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
But come thy ways well go along together
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
Well light upon some settled low content
Master go on and I will follow thee
To the last gasp with truth and loyalty
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I but now live here no more
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek
But at fourscore it is too late a week
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my masters debtor
Exeunt
Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede CELIA for Aliena and TOUCHSTONE
O Jupiter how weary are my spirits
I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
I could find in my heart to disgrace my mans
apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort
the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show
itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage
good Aliena
I pray you bear with me I cannot go no further
For my part I had rather bear with you than bear
you yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you
for I think you have no money in your purse
Well this is the forest of Arden
Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was
at home I was in a better place but travellers
must be content
Ay be so good Touchstone
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
Look you who comes here a young man and an old in
solemn talk
That is the way to make her scorn you still
O Corin that thou knewst how I do love her
I partly guess for I have loved ere now
No Corin being old thou canst not guess
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
As ever sighd upon a midnight pillow
But if thy love were ever like to mine
As sure I think did never man love so
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
Into a thousand that I have forgotten
O thou didst then neer love so heartily
If thou rememberst not the slightest folly
That ever love did make thee run into
Thou hast not loved
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
Thou hast not loved
Or if thou hast not broke from company
Abruptly as my passion now makes me
Thou hast not loved
O Phebe Phebe Phebe
Exit
Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
I have by hard adventure found mine own
And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
coming anight to Jane Smile and I remember the
kissing of her batlet and the cows dugs that her
pretty chopt hands had milked and I remember the
wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took
two cods and giving her them again said with
weeping tears Wear these for my sake We that are
true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly
Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of
Nay I shall neer be ware of mine own wit till I
break my shins against it
Jove Jove this shepherds passion
Is much upon my fashion
And mine but it grows something stale with me
I pray you one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food
I faint almost to death
Holla you clown
Peace fool hes not thy kinsman
Who calls
Your betters sir
Else are they very wretched
Peace I say Good even to you friend
And to you gentle sir and to you all
I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
Heres a young maid with travel much oppressd
And faints for succor
Fair sir I pity her
And wish for her sake more than for mine own
My fortunes were more able to relieve her
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality
Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
By reason of his absence there is nothing
That you will feed on but what is come see
And in my voice most welcome shall you be
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
That little cares for buying any thing
I pray thee if it stand with honesty
Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us
And we will mend thy wages I like this place
And willingly could waste my time in it
Assuredly the thing is to be sold
Go with me if you like upon report
The soil the profit and this kind of life
I will your very faithful feeder be
And buy it with your gold right suddenly
Exeunt

SONG
Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet birds throat
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather
More more I prithee more
It will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques
I thank it More I prithee more I can suck
melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
More I prithee more
My voice is ragged I know I cannot please you
I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to
sing Come more another stanzo call you em stanzos
What you will Monsieur Jaques
Nay I care not for their names they owe me
nothing Will you sing
More at your request than to please myself
Well then if ever I thank any man Ill thank you
but that they call compliment is like the encounter
of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
the beggarly thanks Come sing and you that will
not hold your tongues
Well Ill end the song Sirs cover the while the
duke will drink under this tree He hath been all
this day to look you
And I have been all this day to avoid him He is
too disputable for my company I think of as many
matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no
boast of them Come warble come
SONG
Who doth ambition shun
All together here
And loves to live i the sun
Seeking the food he eats
And pleased with what he gets
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather
Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
yesterday in despite of my invention
And Ill sing it
Thus it goes
If it do come to pass
That any man turn ass
Leaving his wealth and ease
A stubborn will to please
Ducdame ducdame ducdame
Here shall he see
Gross fools as he
An if he will come to me
Whats that ducdame
Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a
circle Ill go sleep if I can if I cannot Ill
rail against all the firstborn of Egypt
And Ill go seek the duke his banquet is prepared
Exeunt severally
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
Dear master I can go no further O I die for food
Here lie I down and measure out my grave Farewell
kind master
Why how now Adam no greater heart in thee Live
a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little
If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage I
will either be food for it or bring it for food to
thee Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers
For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at
the arms end I will here be with thee presently
and if I bring thee not something to eat I will
give thee leave to die but if thou diest before I
come thou art a mocker of my labour Well said
thou lookest cheerly and Ill be with thee quickly
Yet thou liest in the bleak air come I will bear
thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for
lack of a dinner if there live any thing in this
desert Cheerly good Adam
Exeunt
A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and Lords like outlaws
I think he be transformd into a beast
For I can no where find him like a man
My lord he is but even now gone hence
Here was he merry hearing of a song
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
Go seek him tell him I would speak with him
Enter JAQUES
He saves my labour by his own approach
Why how now monsieur what a life is this
That your poor friends must woo your company
What you look merrily
A fool a fool I met a fool i the forest
A motley fool a miserable world
As I do live by food I met a fool
Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun
And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms
In good set terms and yet a motley fool
Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
And then he drew a dial from his poke
And looking on it with lacklustre eye
Says very wisely It is ten oclock
Thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
And after one hour more twill be eleven
And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
And thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
That fools should be so deepcontemplative
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial O noble fool
A worthy fool Motleys the only wear
What fool is this
O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
And says if ladies be but young and fair
They have the gift to know it and in his brain
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
After a voyage he hath strange places crammd
With observation the which he vents
In mangled forms O that I were a fool
I am ambitious for a motley coat
Thou shalt have one
It is my only suit
Provided that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise I must have liberty
Withal as large a charter as the wind
To blow on whom I please for so fools have
And they that are most galled with my folly
They most must laugh And why sir must they so
The why is plain as way to parish church
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly although he smart
Not to seem senseless of the bob if not
The wise mans folly is anatomized
Even by the squandering glances of the fool
Invest me in my motley give me leave
To speak my mind and I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world
If they will patiently receive my medicine
Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do
What for a counter would I do but good
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
For thou thyself hast been a libertine
As sensual as the brutish sting itself
And all the embossed sores and headed evils
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
Why who cries out on pride
That can therein tax any private party
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
Till that the weary very means do ebb
What woman in the city do I name
When that I say the citywoman bears
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
Who can come in and say that I mean her
When such a one as she such is her neighbour
Or what is he of basest function
That says his bravery is not of my cost
Thinking that I mean him but therein suits
His folly to the mettle of my speech
There then how then what then Let me see wherein
My tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right
Then he hath wrongd himself if he be free
Why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
Unclaimd of any man But who comes here
Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
Forbear and eat no more
Why I have eat none yet
Nor shalt not till necessity be served
Of what kind should this cock come of
Art thou thus boldend man by thy distress
Or else a rude despiser of good manners
That in civility thou seemst so empty
You touchd my vein at first the thorny point
Of bare distress hath taen from me the show
Of smooth civility yet am I inland bred
And know some nurture But forbear I say
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered
An you will not be answered with reason I must die
What would you have Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness
I almost die for food and let me have it
Sit down and feed and welcome to our table
Speak you so gently Pardon me I pray you
I thought that all things had been savage here
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment But whateer you are
That in this desert inaccessible
Under the shade of melancholy boughs
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
If ever you have lookd on better days
If ever been where bells have knolld to church
If ever sat at any good mans feast
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
And know what tis to pity and be pitied
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be
In the which hope I blush and hide my sword
True is it that we have seen better days
And have with holy bell been knolld to church
And sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be ministerd
Then but forbear your food a little while
Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
And give it food There is an old poor man
Who after me hath many a weary step
Limpd in pure love till he be first sufficed
Oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger
I will not touch a bit
Go find him out
And we will nothing waste till you return
I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
Exit
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
This wide and universal theatre
Wherein we play in
All the worlds a stage
And all the men and women merely players
They have their exits and their entrances
And one man in his time plays many parts
Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
And then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
And shining morning face creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school And then the lover
Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice
In fair round belly with good capon lined
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
Full of wise saws and modern instances
And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipperd pantaloon
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
His youthful hose well saved a world too wide
For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
Turning again toward childish treble pipes
That ends this strange eventful history
Is second childishness and mere oblivion
Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
Reenter ORLANDO with ADAM
Welcome Set down your venerable burthen
And let him feed
I thank you most for him
So had you need
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself
Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
As yet to question you about your fortunes
Give us some music and good cousin sing
SONG
Blow blow thou winter wind
Thou art not so unkind
As mans ingratitude
Thy tooth is not so keen
Because thou art not seen
Although thy breath be rude
Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
Then heighho the holly
This life is most jolly
Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot
Though thou the waters warp
Thy sting is not so sharp
As friend rememberd not
Heighho sing  and c
If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son
As you have whisperd faithfully you were
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Most truly limnd and living in your face
Be truly welcome hither I am the duke
That loved your father the residue of your fortune
Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
Thou art right welcome as thy master is
Support him by the arm Give me your hand
And let me all your fortunes understand
Exeunt
Enter DUKE FREDERICK Lords and OLIVER
Not see him since Sir sir that cannot be
But were I not the better part made mercy
I should not seek an absent argument
Of my revenge thou present But look to it
Find out thy brother wheresoeer he is
Seek him with candle bring him dead or living
Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more
To seek a living in our territory
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
Of what we think against thee
O that your highness knew my heart in this
I never loved my brother in my life
More villain thou Well push him out of doors
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands
Do this expediently and turn him going

Hang there my verse in witness of my love
And thou thricecrowned queen of night survey
With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above

Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where
Run run Orlando carve on every tree

Exit
Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
And how like you this shepherds life Master Touchstone
Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
life but in respect that it is a shepherds life
it is naught In respect that it is solitary I
like it very well but in respect that it is
private it is a very vile life Now in respect it
is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
respect it is not in the court it is tedious As
is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd
No more but that I know the more one sickens the
worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
means and content is without three good friends
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred
Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in
court shepherd
No truly
Then thou art damned
Nay I hope
Truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all
on one side
For not being at court Your reason
Why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
good manners if thou never sawest good manners
then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous
state shepherd
Not a whit Touchstone those that are good manners
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court You told me you salute not at the court but
you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
Instance briefly come instance
Why we are still handling our ewes and their
fells you know are greasy
Why do not your courtiers hands sweat and is not
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
a man Shallow shallow A better instance I say come
Besides our hands are hard
Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again
A more sounder instance come
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The
courtiers hands are perfumed with civet
Most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a
good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and
perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherd
You have too courtly a wit for me Ill rest
Wilt thou rest damned God help thee shallow man
God make incision in thee thou art raw
Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get
that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans
happiness glad of other mens good content with my
harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
graze and my lambs suck
That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your
living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a
twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
out of all reasonable match If thou beest not
damned for this the devil himself will have no
shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst
scape
Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistresss brother
Enter ROSALIND with a paper reading
From the east to western Ind
No jewel is like Rosalind
Her worth being mounted on the wind
Through all the world bears Rosalind
All the pictures fairest lined
Are but black to Rosalind
Let no fair be kept in mind
But the fair of Rosalind
Ill rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
right butterwomens rank to market
Out fool
For a taste
If a hart do lack a hind
Let him seek out Rosalind
If the cat will after kind
So be sure will Rosalind
Winter garments must be lined
So must slender Rosalind
They that reap must sheaf and bind
Then to cart with Rosalind
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind
Such a nut is Rosalind
He that sweetest rose will find
Must find loves prick and Rosalind
This is the very false gallop of verses why do you
infect yourself with them
Peace you dull fool I found them on a tree
Truly the tree yields bad fruit
Ill graff it with you and then I shall graff it
with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
i the country for youll be rotten ere you be half
ripe and thats the right virtue of the medlar
You have said but whether wisely or no let the
forest judge
Enter CELIA with a writing
Peace Here comes my sister reading stand aside
Reads
Why should this a desert be
For it is unpeopled No
Tongues Ill hang on every tree
That shall civil sayings show
Some how brief the life of man
Runs his erring pilgrimage
That the stretching of a span
Buckles in his sum of age
Some of violated vows
Twixt the souls of friend and friend
But upon the fairest boughs
Or at every sentence end
Will I Rosalinda write
Teaching all that read to know
The quintessence of every sprite
Heaven would in little show
Therefore Heaven Nature charged
That one body should be filld
With all graces wideenlarged
Nature presently distilld
Helens cheek but not her heart
Cleopatras majesty
Atalantas better part
Sad Lucretias modesty
Thus Rosalind of many parts
By heavenly synod was devised
Of many faces eyes and hearts
To have the touches dearest prized
Heaven would that she these gifts should have
And I to live and die her slave
O most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
cried Have patience good people
How now back friends Shepherd go off a little
Go with him sirrah
Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
Didst thou hear these verses
O yes I heard them all and more too for some of
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear
Thats no matter the feet might bear the verses
Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
themselves without the verse and therefore stood
lamely in the verse
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
before you came for look here what I found on a
palmtree I was never so berhymed since
Pythagoras time that I was an Irish rat which I
can hardly remember
Trow you who hath done this
Is it a man
And a chain that you once wore about his neck
Change you colour
I prithee who
O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to
meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
and so encounter
Nay but who is it
Is it possible
Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
tell me who it is
O wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
out of all hooping
Good my complexion dost thou think though I am
caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in
my disposition One inch of delay more is a
Southsea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it
quickly and speak apace I would thou couldst
stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
may drink thy tidings
So you may put a man in your belly
Is he of Gods making What manner of man Is his
head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
Nay he hath but a little beard
Why God will send more if the man will be
thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin
It is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestlers
heels and your heart both in an instant
Nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and
true maid
I faith coz tis he
Orlando
Orlando
Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and
hose What did he when thou sawest him What said
he How looked he Wherein went he What makes
him here Did he ask for me Where remains he
How parted he with thee and when shalt thou see
him again Answer me in one word
You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first tis a
word too great for any mouth of this ages size To
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
mans apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the
day he wrestled
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
finding him and relish it with good observance
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn
It may well be called Joves tree when it drops
forth such fruit
Give me audience good madam
Proceed
There lay he stretched along like a wounded knight
Though it be pity to see such a sight it well
becomes the ground
Cry holla to thy tongue I prithee it curvets
unseasonably He was furnished like a hunter
O ominous he comes to kill my heart
I would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
me out of tune
Do you not know I am a woman when I think I must
speak Sweet say on
You bring me out Soft comes he not here
Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
Tis he slink by and note him
I thank you for your company but good faith I had
as lief have been myself alone
And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you
too for your society
God be wi you lets meet as little as we can
I do desire we may be better strangers
I pray you mar no more trees with writing
lovesongs in their barks
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
them illfavouredly
Rosalind is your loves name
Yes just
I do not like her name
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened
What stature is she of
Just as high as my heart
You are full of pretty answers Have you not been
acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
out of rings
Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from
whence you have studied your questions
You have a nimble wit I think twas made of
Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery
I will chide no breather in the world but myself
against whom I know most faults
The worst fault you have is to be in love
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue
I am weary of you
By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found
you
He is drowned in the brook look but in and you
shall see him
There I shall see mine own figure
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher
Ill tarry no longer with you farewell good
Signior Love
I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur
Melancholy
Exit JAQUES
Aside to CELIA  I will speak to him like a saucy
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
Do you hear forester
Very well what would you
I pray you what ist oclock
You should ask me what time o day theres no clock
in the forest
Then there is no true lover in the forest else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock
And why not the swift foot of Time had not that
been as proper
By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with
divers persons Ill tell you who Time ambles
withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops
withal and who he stands still withal
I prithee who doth he trot withal
Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
solemnized if the interim be but a sennight
Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year
Who ambles Time withal
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury these Time ambles withal
Who doth he gallop withal
With a thief to the gallows for though he go as
softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
Who stays it still withal
With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves
Where dwell you pretty youth
With this shepherdess my sister here in the
skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
Are you native of this place
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled
Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling
I have been told so of many but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
too well for there he fell in love I have heard
him read many lectures against it and I thank God
I am not a woman to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women
There were none principal they were all like one
another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it
I prithee recount some of them
No I will not cast away my physic but on those that
are sick There is a man haunts the forest that
abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on
their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
Rosalind if I could meet that fancymonger I would
give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him
I am he that is so loveshaked I pray you tell me
your remedy
There is none of my uncles marks upon you he
taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner
What were his marks
A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
sunken which you have not an unquestionable
spirit which you have not a beard neglected
which you have not but I pardon you for that for
simply your having in beard is a younger brothers
revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation but you are no such man you
are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other
Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love
Me believe it you may as soon make her that you
love believe it which I warrant she is apter to
do than to confess she does that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences But in good sooth are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind
is so admired
I swear to thee youth by the white hand of
Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel
Did you ever cure any so
Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me
his love his mistress and I set him every day to
woo me at which time would I being but a moonish
youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness which was to forswear the full stream of
the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
And thus I cured him and this way will I take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps
heart that there shall not be one spot of love int
I would not be cured youth
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me
Now by the faith of my love I will tell me
where it is
Go with me to it and Ill show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live
Will you go
With all my heart good youth
Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go
Exeunt
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY JAQUES behind
Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your
goats Audrey And how Audrey am I the man yet
doth my simple feature content you
Your features Lord warrant us what features
I am here with thee and thy goats as the most
capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths
Aside  O knowledge illinhabited worse than Jove
in a thatched house
When a mans verses cannot be understood nor a
mans good wit seconded with the forward child
Understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room Truly I would
the gods had made thee poetical
I do not know what poetical is is it honest in
deed and word is it a true thing
No truly for the truest poetry is the most
feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
I do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some
hope thou didst feign
Would you not have me honest
No truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
Aside  A material fool
Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods
make me honest
Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
were to put good meat into an unclean dish
I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul
Well praised be the gods for thy foulness
sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may
be I will marry thee and to that end I have been
with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next
village who hath promised to meet me in this place
of the forest and to couple us
Aside  I would fain see this meeting
Well the gods give us joy
Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart
stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts But what
though C ourage As horns are odious they are
necessary It is said many a man knows no end of
his goods right many a man has good horns and
knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of
his wife tis none of his own getting Horns
Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man
therefore blessed No as a walled town is more
worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
want Here comes Sir Oliver
Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
Sir Oliver Martext you are well met will you
dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go
with you to your chapel
Is there none here to give the woman
I will not take her on gift of any man
Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
Advancing
Proceed proceedIll give her
Good even good Master Whatyecallt how do you
sir You are very well met God ild you for your
last company I am very glad to see you even a
toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered
Will you be married motley
As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and
as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling
And will you being a man of your breeding be
married under a bush like a beggar Get you to
church and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is this fellow will but join you
together as they join wainscot then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
Aside  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
married of him than of another for he is not like
to marry me well and not being well married it
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife
Go thou with me and let me counsel thee
Come sweet Audrey
We must be married or we must live in bawdry
Farewell good Master Oliver not
O sweet Oliver
O brave Oliver
Leave me not behind thee but
Wind away
Begone I say
I will not to wedding with thee
Exeunt JAQUES TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
Tis no matter neer a fantastical knave of them
all shall flout me out of my calling
Exit
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
Never talk to me I will weep
Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man
But have I not cause to weep
As good cause as one would desire therefore weep
His very hair is of the dissembling colour
Something browner than Judass marry his kisses are
Judass own children
I faith his hair is of a good colour
An excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
of holy bread
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana a nun
of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously
the very ice of chastity is in them
But why did he swear he would come this morning and
comes not
Nay certainly there is no truth in him
Do you think so
Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a
horsestealer but for his verity in love I do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
wormeaten nut
Not true in love
Yes when he is in but I think he is not in
You have heard him swear downright he was
Was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends
here in the forest on the duke your father
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
him he asked me of what parentage I was I told
him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a
man as Orlando
O thats a brave man he writes brave verses
speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of
his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse
but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
goose but alls brave that youth mounts and folly
guides Who comes here
Enter CORIN
Mistress and master you have oft inquired
After the shepherd that complaind of love
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress
Well and what of him
If you will see a pageant truly playd
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you
If you will mark it
O come let us remove
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love
Bring us to this sight and you shall say
Exeunt
Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
Sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe
Say that you love me not but say not so
In bitterness The common executioner
Whose heart the accustomd sight of death makes hard
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
But first begs pardon will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
Enter ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN behind
I would not be thy executioner
I fly thee for I would not injure thee
Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye
Tis pretty sure and very probable
That eyes that are the frailst and softest things
Who shut their coward gates on atomies
Should be calld tyrants butchers murderers
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart
And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame
Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
Some scar of it lean but upon a rush
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
That can do hurt
O dear Phebe
If everas that ever may be near
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
Then shall you know the wounds invisible
That loves keen arrows make
But till that time
Come not thou near me and when that time comes
Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
As till that time I shall not pity thee
And why I pray you Who might be your mother
That you insult exult and all at once
Over the wretched What though you have no beauty
As by my faith I see no more in you
Than without candle may go dark to bed
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless
Why what means this Why do you look on me
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of natures salework Ods my little life
I think she means to tangle my eyes too
No faith proud mistress hope not after it
Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
That can entame my spirits to your worship
You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of illfavourd children
Tis not her glass but you that flatters her
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her
But mistress know yourself down on your knees
And thank heaven fasting for a good mans love
For I must tell you friendly in your ear
Sell when you can you are not for all markets
Cry the man mercy love him take his offer
Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
So take her to thee shepherd fare you well
Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo
Hes fallen in love with your foulness and shell
fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as
she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her
with bitter words Why look you so upon me
For no ill will I bear you
I pray you do not fall in love with me
For I am falser than vows made in wine
Besides I like you not If you will know my house
Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard
Come sister Shepherdess look on him better
And be not proud though all the world could see
None could be so abused in sight as he
Come to our flock
Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN
Dead Shepherd now I find thy saw of might
Who ever loved that loved not at first sight
Sweet Phebe
Ha what sayst thou Silvius
Sweet Phebe pity me
Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius
Wherever sorrow is relief would be
If you do sorrow at my grief in love
By giving love your sorrow and my grief
Were both extermined
Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
I would have you
Why that were covetousness
Silvius the time was that I hated thee
And yet it is not that I bear thee love
But since that thou canst talk of love so well
Thy company which erst was irksome to me
I will endure and Ill employ thee too
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employd
So holy and so perfect is my love
And I in such a poverty of grace
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
To glean the broken ears after the man
That the main harvest reaps loose now and then
A scatterd smile and that Ill live upon
Knowst now the youth that spoke to me erewhile
Not very well but I have met him oft
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
That the old carlot once was master of
Think not I love him though I ask for him
Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
But what care I for words yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
It is a pretty youth not very pretty
But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him
Hell make a proper man the best thing in him
Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up
He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall
His leg is but so so and yet tis well
There was a pretty redness in his lip
A little riper and more lusty red
Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
Between the constant red and mingled damask
There be some women Silvius had they markd him
In parcels as I did would have gone near
To fall in love with him but for my part
I love him not nor hate him not and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him
For what had he to do to chide at me
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
And now I am rememberd scornd at me
I marvel why I answerd not again
But thats all one omittance is no quittance
Ill write to him a very taunting letter
And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius
Phebe with all my heart
Ill write it straight
The matters in my head and in my heart
I will be bitter with him and passing short
Go with me Silvius
Exeunt
Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES
I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
with thee
They say you are a melancholy fellow
I am so I do love it better than laughing
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern
censure worse than drunkards
Why tis good to be sad and say nothing
Why then tis good to be a post
I have neither the scholars melancholy which is
emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical
nor the courtiers which is proud nor the
soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers
which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor
the lovers which is all these but it is a
melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
contemplation of my travels in which my often
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness
A traveller By my faith you have great reason to
be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see
other mens then to have seen much and to have
nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
Yes I have gained my experience
And your experience makes you sad I had rather have
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
sad and to travel for it too
Enter ORLANDO
Good day and happiness dear Rosalind
Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse
Exit
Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and
wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
own country be out of love with your nativity and
almost chide God for making you that countenance you
are or I will scarce think you have swam in a
gondola Why how now Orlando where have you been
all this while You a lover An you serve me such
another trick never come in my sight more
My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise
Break an hours promise in love He that will
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid
hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant
him heartwhole
Pardon me dear Rosalind
Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I
had as lief be wooed of a snail
Of a snail
Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
carries his house on his head a better jointure
I think than you make a woman besides he brings
his destiny with him
Whats that
Why horns which such as you are fain to be
beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife
Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous
And I am your Rosalind
It pleases him to call you so but he hath a
Rosalind of a better leer than you
Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday
humour and like enough to consent What would you
say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind
I would kiss before I spoke
Nay you were better speak first and when you were
gravelled for lack of matter you might take
occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are
out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod
warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss
How if the kiss be denied
Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter
Who could be out being before his beloved mistress
Marry that should you if I were your mistress or
I should think my honesty ranker than my wit
What of my suit
Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
Am not I your Rosalind
I take some joy to say you are because I would be
talking of her
Well in her person I say I will not have you
Then in mine own person I die
No faith die by attorney The poor world is
almost six thousand years old and in all this time
there was not any man died in his own person
videlicit in a lovecause Troilus had his brains
dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he
could to die before and he is one of the patterns
of love Leander he would have lived many a fair
year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been
for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos
But these are all lies men have died from time to
time and worms have eaten them but not for love
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind
for I protest her frown might kill me
By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now
I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon
disposition and ask me what you will I will grant
it
Then love me Rosalind
Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all
And wilt thou have me
Ay and twenty such
What sayest thou
Are you not good
I hope so
Why then can one desire too much of a good thing
Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister
Pray thee marry us
I cannot say the words
You must begin Will you Orlando
Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind
I will
Ay but when
Why now as fast as she can marry us
Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife
I take thee Rosalind for wife
I might ask you for your commission but I do take
thee Orlando for my husband theres a girl goes
before the priest and certainly a womans thought
So do all thoughts they are winged
Now tell me how long you would have her after you
have possessed her
For ever and a day
Say a day without the ever No no Orlando
men are April when they woo December when they wed
maids are May when they are maids but the sky
changes when they are wives I will be more jealous
of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen
more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana
in the fountain and I will do that when you are
disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and
that when thou art inclined to sleep
But will my Rosalind do so
By my life she will do as I do
O but she is wise
Or else she could not have the wit to do this the
wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans
wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly
with the smoke out at the chimney
A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
Wit whither wilt
Nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed
And what wit could wit have to excuse that
Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall
never take her without her answer unless you take
her without her tongue O that woman that cannot
make her fault her husbands occasion let her
never nurse her child herself for she will breed
it like a fool
For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee
Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours
I must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock I
will be with thee again
Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you
would prove my friends told me as much and I
thought no less that flattering tongue of yours
won me tis but one cast away and so come
death Two oclock is your hour
Ay sweet Rosalind
By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend
me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
if you break one jot of your promise or come one
minute behind your hour I will think you the most
pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
may be chosen out of the gross band of the
unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep

O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But
it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
bottom like the bay of Portugal
Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
affection in it runs out
No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes
because his own are out let him be judge how deep I
am in love Ill tell thee Aliena I cannot be out

Yes sir
Sing it tis no matter how it be in tune so it

SONG
What shall he have that killd the deer
His leather skin and horns to wear
Then sing him home
The rest shall bear this burden

And thy father bore it

My errand is to you fair youth
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this
I know not the contents but as I guess
Which she did use as she was writing of it
It bears an angry tenor pardon me
I am but as a guiltless messenger
Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer bear this bear all
She says I am not fair that I lack manners
She calls me proud and that she could not love me
Were man as rare as phoenix Ods my will
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt
Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well
This is a letter of your own device
No I protest I know not the contents
Phebe did write it
Come come you are a fool
And turnd into the extremity of love
I saw her hand she has a leathern hand
A freestonecolourd hand I verily did think
That her old gloves were on but twas her hands
She has a huswifes hand but thats no matter
I say she never did invent this letter
This is a mans invention and his hand
Sure it is hers
Why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
A style forchallengers why she defies me
Like Turk to Christian womens gentle brain
Could not drop forth such giantrude invention
Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter
So please you for I never heard it yet
Yet heard too much of Phebes cruelty
She Phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
Reads
Art thou god to shepherd turnd
That a maidens heart hath burnd
Can a woman rail thus
Call you this railing
Reads
Why thy godhead laid apart
Warrst thou with a womans heart
Did you ever hear such railing
Whiles the eye of man did woo me
That could do no vengeance to me
Meaning me a beast
If the scorn of your bright eyne
Have power to raise such love in mine
Alack in me what strange effect
Would they work in mild aspect
Whiles you chid me I did love
How then might your prayers move
He that brings this love to thee
Little knows this love in me
And by him seal up thy mind
Whether that thy youth and kind
Will the faithful offer take
Of me and all that I can make
Or else by him my love deny
And then Ill study how to die
Call you this chiding
Alas poor shepherd
Do you pity him no he deserves no pity Wilt
thou love such a woman What to make thee an
instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
be endured Well go your way to her for I see
love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
her that if she love me I charge her to love
thee if she will not I will never have her unless
thou entreat for her If you be a true lover
hence and not a word for here comes more company

Good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees
West of this place down in the neighbour bottom
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
Left on your right hand brings you to the place
But at this hour the house doth keep itself
Theres none within
If that an eye may profit by a tongue
Then should I know you by description
Such garments and such years The boy is fair
Of female favour and bestows himself
Like a ripe sister the woman low
And browner than her brother Are not you
The owner of the house I did inquire for
It is no boast being askd to say we are
Orlando doth commend him to you both
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
He sends this bloody napkin Are you he
I am what must we understand by this
Some of my shame if you will know of me
What man I am and how and why and where
This handkercher was staind
I pray you tell it
When last the young Orlando parted from you
He left a promise to return again
Within an hour and pacing through the forest
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
Lo what befell he threw his eye aside
And mark what object did present itself
Under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age
And high top bald with dry antiquity
A wretched ragged man oergrown with hair
Lay sleeping on his back about his neck
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
Who with her head nimble in threats approachd
The opening of his mouth but suddenly
Seeing Orlando it unlinkd itself
And with indented glides did slip away
Into a bush under which bushs shade
A lioness with udders all drawn dry
Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
When that the sleeping man should stir for tis
The royal disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
This seen Orlando did approach the man
And found it was his brother his elder brother
O I have heard him speak of that same brother
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men
And well he might so do
For well I know he was unnatural
But to Orlando did he leave him there
Food to the suckd and hungry lioness
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so
But kindness nobler ever than revenge
And nature stronger than his just occasion
Made him give battle to the lioness
Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
From miserable slumber I awaked
Are you his brother
Wast you he rescued
Wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him
Twas I but tis not II do not shame
To tell you what I was since my conversion
So sweetly tastes being the thing I am
But for the bloody napkin
By and by
When from the first to last betwixt us two
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
As how I came into that desert place
In brief he led me to the gentle duke
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment
Committing me unto my brothers love
Who led me instantly unto his cave
There strippd himself and here upon his arm
The lioness had torn some flesh away
Which all this while had bled and now he fainted
And cried in fainting upon Rosalind
Brief I recoverd him bound up his wound
And after some small space being strong at heart
He sent me hither stranger as I am
To tell this story that you might excuse
His broken promise and to give this napkin
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind
ROSALIND swoons
Why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede
Many will swoon when they do look on blood
There is more in it Cousin Ganymede
Look he recovers
I would I were at home
Well lead you thither
I pray you will you take him by the arm
Be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a
mans heart
I do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would
think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell
your brother how well I counterfeited Heighho
This was not counterfeit there is too great
testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
of earnest
Counterfeit I assure you
Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
So I do but i faith I should have been a woman by right
Come you look paler and paler pray you draw
homewards Good sir go with us
That will I for I must bear answer back
How you excuse my brother Rosalind
I shall devise something but I pray you commend
my counterfeiting to him Will you go

Wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady

swoon when he showed me your handkerchief
Ay and greater wonders than that
O I know where you are nay tis true there was
never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams

overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
met but they looked no sooner looked but they
loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
sighed but they asked one another the reason no

else be incontinent before marriage they are in

is to look into happiness through another mans
eyes By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at

think my brother happy in having what he wishes for

When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring
Between the acres of the rye
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
These pretty country folks would lie
In spring time  and c
This carol they began that hour
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
How that a life was but a flower
In spring time  and c
And therefore take the present time
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
For love is crowned with the prime
In spring time  and c

well cut he would answer I spake not true this
is called the Reproof Valiant If again it was not
well cut he would say I lied this is called the

That bring these tidings to this fair assembly

Men of great worth resorted to this forest
Addressd a mighty power which were on foot
In his own conduct purposely to take
His brother here and put him to the sword
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came
Where meeting with an old religious man
After some question with him was converted
Both from his enterprise and from the world
His crown bequeathing to his banishd brother
And all their lands restored to them again
That were with him exiled This to be true
I do engage my life
Welcome young man
Thou offerst fairly to thy brothers wedding
To one his lands withheld and to the other
A land itself at large a potent dukedom
First in this forest let us do those ends
That here were well begun and well begot
And after every of this happy number
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
Shall share the good of our returned fortune
According to the measure of their states
Meantime forget this newfalln dignity
And fall into our rustic revelry
Play music And you brides and bridegrooms all
With measure heapd in joy to the measures fall

And thrown into neglect the pompous court

You shall outlive the lady whom you serve
O excellent I love long life better than figs
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach
Then belike my children shall have no names
prithee how many boys and wenches must I have
If every of your wishes had a womb
And fertile every wish a million
Out fool I forgive thee for a witch
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes
Nay come tell Iras hers
Well know all our fortunes
Mine and most of our fortunes tonight shall
bedrunk to bed
Theres a palm presages chastity if nothing else
Een as the oerflowing Nilus presageth famine
Go you wild bedfellow you cannot soothsay
Nay if an oily palm be not a fruitful
prognostication I cannot scratch mine ear Prithee
tell her but a workyday fortune
Your fortunes are alike
But how but how give me particulars
I have said
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she
Well if you were but an inch of fortune better than
I where would you choose it
Not in my husbands nose
Our worser thoughts heavens mend Alexascome
his fortune his fortune O let him marry a woman
that cannot go sweet Isis I beseech thee and let
her die too and give him a worse and let worst
follow worse till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave fiftyfold a cuckold Good
Isis hear me this prayer though thou deny me a
matter of more weight good Isis I beseech thee
Amen Dear goddess hear that prayer of the people
for as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
loosewived so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
foul knave uncuckolded therefore dear Isis keep
decorum and fortune him accordingly
Amen
Lo now if it lay in their hands to make me a
cuckold they would make themselves whores but
theyld dot
Hush here comes Antony
Not he the queen
Enter CLEOPATRA
Saw you my lord
No lady
Was he not here
No madam
He was disposed to mirth but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him Enobarbus
Madam
Seek him and bring him hither
Wheres Alexas
Here at your service My lord approaches
We will not look upon him go with us
Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field
Against my brother Lucius
Ay
But soon that war had end and the times state
Made friends of them joining their force gainst Caesar
Whose better issue in the war from Italy
Upon the first encounter drave them
Well what worst
The nature of bad news infects the teller
When it concerns the fool or coward On
Things that are past are done with me Tis thus
Who tells me true though in his tale lie death
I hear him as he flatterd
Labienus
This is stiff newshath with his Parthian force
Extended Asia from Euphrates
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia Whilst
Antony thou wouldst say
O my lord
Speak to me home mince not the general tongue
Name Cleopatra as she is calld in Rome
Rail thou in Fulvias phrase and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter O then we bring forth weeds
When our quick minds lie still and our ills told us
Is as our earing Fare thee well awhile
At your noble pleasure
Exit
From Sicyon ho the news Speak there
The man from Sicyonis there such an one
He stays upon your will
Let him appear
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break
Or lose myself in dotage
Enter another Messenger
What are you
Fulvia thy wife is dead
Where died she
In Sicyon
Her length of sickness with what else more serious
Importeth thee to know this bears
Gives a letter
Forbear me
Exit Second Messenger
Theres a great spirit gone Thus did I desire it
What our contempt doth often hurl from us
We wish it ours again the present pleasure
By revolution lowering does become
The opposite of itself shes good being gone
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on
I must from this enchanting queen break off
Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know
My idleness doth hatch How now Enobarbus
Reenter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Whats your pleasure sir
I must with haste from hence
Why then we kill all our women
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them
if they suffer our departure deaths the word
I must be gone
Under a compelling occasion let women die it were
pity to cast them away for nothing though between
them and a great cause they should be esteemed
nothing Cleopatra catching but the least noise of
this dies instantly I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment I do think there is
her she hath such a celerity in dying
She is cunning past mans thought
Exit ALEXAS
Alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report this
cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove
Would I had never seen her
O sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
of work which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel
Fulvia is dead
Sir
Fulvia is dead
Fulvia
Dead
Why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice When
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth
comforting therein that when old robes are worn
out there are members to make new If there were
no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut
and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned
with consolation your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence
And the business you have broached here cannot be
without you especially that of Cleopatras which
wholly depends on your abode
No more light answers Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the queen
And get her leave to part For not alone
The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches
Do strongly speak to us but the letters too
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands
The empire of the sea our slippery people
Whose love is never linkd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son who high in name and power
Higher than both in blood and life stands up
For the main soldier whose quality going on
The sides o the world may danger much is breeding
Which like the coursers hair hath yet but life
And not a serpents poison Say our pleasure
To such whose place is under us requires
Our quick remove from hence
I shall dot
Exeunt
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and ALEXAS
Where is he
I did not see him since
See where he is whos with him what he does
I did not send you if you find him sad
Say I am dancing if in mirth report
That I am sudden sick quick and return
Exit ALEXAS
Madam methinks if you did love him dearly
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him
What should I do I do not
In each thing give him way cross him nothing
Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him
Tempt him not so too far I wish forbear
In time we hate that which we often fear
But here comes Antony
Enter MARK ANTONY
I am sick and sullen
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
Help me away dear Charmian I shall fall
It cannot be thus long the sides of nature
Will not sustain it
Now my dearest queen
Pray you stand further from me
Whats the matter
I know by that same eye theres some good news
What says the married woman You may go
Would she had never given you leave to come
Let her not say tis I that keep you here
I have no power upon you hers you are
The gods best know
O never was there queen
So mightily betrayd yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted
Cleopatra
Why should I think you can be mine and true
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods
Who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness
To be entangled with those mouthmade vows
Which break themselves in swearing
Most sweet queen
Nay pray you seek no colour for your going
But bid farewell and go when you sued staying
Then was the time for words no going then
Eternity was in our lips and eyes
Bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor
But was a race of heaven they are so still
Or thou the greatest soldier of the world
Art turnd the greatest liar
How now lady
I would I had thy inches thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt
Hear me queen
The strong necessity of time commands
Our services awhile but my full heart
Remains in use with you Our Italy
Shines oer with civil swords Sextus Pompeius
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome
Equality of two domestic powers
Are newly grown to love the condemnd Pompey
Rich in his fathers honour creeps apace
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
Upon the present state whose numbers threaten
And quietness grown sick of rest would purge
By any desperate change my more particular
And that which most with you should safe my going
Is Fulvias death
Though age from folly could not give me freedom
It does from childishness can Fulvia die
Shes dead my queen
Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
The garboils she awaked at the last best
See when and where she died
O most false love
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water Now I see I see
In Fulvias death how mine received shall be
Quarrel no more but be prepared to know
The purposes I bear which are or cease
As you shall give the advice By the fire
That quickens Nilus slime I go from hence
Thy soldier servant making peace or war
As thou affectst
Cut my lace Charmian come
But let it be I am quickly ill and well
So Antony loves
My precious queen forbear
And give true evidence to his love which stands
An honourable trial
So Fulvia told me
I prithee turn aside and weep for her
Then bid adieu to me and say the tears
Of excellent dissembling and let it look
Life perfect honour
Youll heat my blood no more
You can do better yet but this is meetly
Now by my sword
And target Still he mends
But this is not the best Look prithee Charmian
How this Herculean Roman does become
The carriage of his chafe
Ill leave you lady
Courteous lord one word
Sir you and I must part but thats not it
Sir you and I have loved but theres not it
That you know well something it is I would
O my oblivion is a very Antony
And I am all forgotten
But that your royalty
Holds idleness your subject I should take you
For idleness itself
Tis sweating labour
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this But sir forgive me
Since my becomings kill me when they do not
Eye well to you your honour calls you hence
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
And all the gods go with you upon your sword
Sit laurel victory and smooth success
Be strewd before your feet
Let us go Come
Our separation so abides and flies
That thou residing here gost yet with me
And I hence fleeting here remain with thee Away
Exeunt
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter LEPIDUS and their Train
You may see Lepidus and henceforth know
It is not Caesars natural vice to hate
Our great competitor from Alexandria
This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike
Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he hardly gave audience or
Vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there
That all men follow
I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
More fiery by nights blackness hereditary
Rather than purchased what he cannot change
Than what he chooses
You are too indulgent Let us grant it is not
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy
To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave
To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
With knaves that smell of sweat say this
becomes him
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemishyet must Antony
No way excuse his soils when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness If he filld
His vacancy with his voluptuousness
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
Call on him fort but to confound such time
That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
As his own state and ourstis to be chid
As we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure
And so rebel to judgment
Enter a Messenger
Heres more news
Thy biddings have been done and every hour
Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report
How tis abroad Pompey is strong at sea
And it appears he is beloved of those
That only have feard Caesar to the ports
The discontents repair and mens reports
Give him much wrongd
I should have known no less
It hath been taught us from the primal state
That he which is was wishd until he were
And the ebbd man neer loved till neer worth love
Comes deard by being lackd This common body
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream
Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
To rot itself with motion
Caesar I bring thee word
Menecrates and Menas famous pirates
Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
With keels of every kind many hot inroads
They make in Italy the borders maritime
Lack blood to think ont and flush youth revolt
No vessel can peep forth but tis as soon
Taken as seen for Pompeys name strikes more
Than could his war resisted
Antony
Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once
Wast beaten from Modena where thou slewst
Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel
Did famine follow whom thou foughtst against
Though daintily brought up with patience more
Than savages could suffer thou didst drink
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
Which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge
Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
The barks of trees thou browsedst on the Alps
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
Which some did die to look on and all this
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now
Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
So much as lankd not
Tis pity of him
Let his shames quickly
Drive him to Rome tis time we twain
Did show ourselves i the field and to that end
Assemble we immediate council Pompey
Thrives in our idleness
Tomorrow Caesar
I shall be furnishd to inform you rightly
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time
Till which encounter
It is my business too Farewell
Farewell my lord what you shall know meantime
Of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir
To let me be partaker
Doubt not sir
I knew it for my bond
Exeunt
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and MARDIAN
Charmian
Madam
Ha ha
Give me to drink mandragora
Why madam
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away
You think of him too much
O tis treason
Madam I trust not so
Thou eunuch Mardian
Whats your highness pleasure
Not now to hear thee sing I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has tis well for thee
That being unseminard thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt Hast thou affections
Yes gracious madam
Indeed
Not in deed madam for I can do nothing
But what indeed is honest to be done
Yet have I fierce affections and think
What Venus did with Mars
O Charmian
Where thinkst thou he is now Stands he or sits he
Or does he walk or is he on his horse
O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony
Do bravely horse for wotst thou whom thou movest
The demiAtlas of this earth the arm
And burgonet of men Hes speaking now
Or murmuring Wheres my serpent of old Nile
For so he calls me now I feed myself
With most delicious poison Think on me
That am with Phoebus amorous pinches black
And wrinkled deep in time Broadfronted Caesar
When thou wast here above the ground I was
A morsel for a monarch and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life
Enter ALEXAS from OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Sovereign of Egypt hail
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony
Yet coming from him that great medicine hath
With his tinct gilded thee
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony
Last thing he did dear queen
He kissdthe last of many doubled kisses
This orient pearl His speech sticks in my heart
Mine ear must pluck it thence
Good friend quoth he
Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster at whose foot
To mend the petty present I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east
Say thou shall call her mistress So he nodded
And soberly did mount an armgaunt steed
Who neighd so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumbd by him
What was he sad or merry
Like to the time o the year between the extremes
Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
O welldivided disposition Note him
Note him good Charmian tis the man but note him
He was not sad for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his he was not merry
Which seemd to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy but between both
O heavenly mingle Best thou sad or merry
The violence of either thee becomes
So does it no man else Metst thou my posts
Ay madam twenty several messengers
Why do you send so thick
Whos born that day
When I forget to send to Antony
Shall die a beggar Ink and paper Charmian
Welcome my good Alexas Did I Charmian
Ever love Caesar so
O that brave Caesar
Be choked with such another emphasis
Say the brave Antony
The valiant Caesar
By Isis I will give thee bloody teeth
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men
By your most gracious pardon
I sing but after you
My salad days
When I was green in judgment cold in blood
To say as I said then But come away
Get me ink and paper
He shall have every day a several greeting
Or Ill unpeople Egypt
Exeunt
Enter POMPEY MENECRATES and MENAS in warlike manner
If the great gods be just they shall assist
The deeds of justest men
Know worthy Pompey
That what they do delay they not deny
Whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
The thing we sue for
We ignorant of ourselves
Beg often our own harms which the wise powers
Deny us for our good so find we profit
By losing of our prayers
I shall do well
The people love me and the sea is mine
My powers are crescent and my auguring hope
Says it will come to the full Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner and will make
No wars without doors Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts Lepidus flatters both
Of both is flatterd but he neither loves
Nor either cares for him
Caesar and Lepidus
Are in the field a mighty strength they carry
Where have you this tis false
From Silvius sir
He dreams I know they are in Rome together
Looking for Antony But all the charms of love
Salt Cleopatra soften thy waned lip
Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
Keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
Even till a Lethed dulness
Enter VARRIUS
How now Varrius
This is most certain that I shall deliver
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
Expected since he went from Egypt tis
A space for further travel
I could have given less matter
A better ear Menas I did not think
This amorous surfeiter would have donnd his helm
For such a petty war his soldiership
Is twice the other twain but let us rear
The higher our opinion that our stirring
Can from the lap of Egypts widow pluck
The neerlustwearied Antony
I cannot hope
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together
His wife thats dead did trespasses to Caesar
His brother warrd upon him although I think
Not moved by Antony
I know not Menas
How lesser enmities may give way to greater
Weret not that we stand up against them all
Twere pregnant they should square between
themselves
For they have entertained cause enough
To draw their swords but how the fear of us
May cement their divisions and bind up
The petty difference we yet not know
Bet as our gods will havet It only stands
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands
Come Menas
Exeunt
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
Good Enobarbus tis a worthy deed
And shall become you well to entreat your captain
To soft and gentle speech
I shall entreat him
To answer like himself if Caesar move him
Let Antony look over Caesars head
And speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter
Were I the wearer of Antonius beard
I would not shavet today
Tis not a time
For private stomaching
Every time
Serves for the matter that is then born int
But small to greater matters must give way
Not if the small come first
Your speech is passion
But pray you stir no embers up Here comes
The noble Antony
Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
And yonder Caesar
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR MECAENAS and AGRIPPA
If we compose well here to Parthia
Hark Ventidius
I do not know
Mecaenas ask Agrippa
Noble friends
That which combined us was most great and let not
May it be gently heard when we debate
Our trivial difference loud we do commit
Murder in healing wounds then noble partners
The rather for I earnestly beseech
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
Nor curstness grow to the matter
Tis spoken well
Were we before our armies and to fight
I should do thus
Flourish
Welcome to Rome
Thank you
Sit
Sit sir
Nay then
I learn you take things ill which are not so
Or being concern you not
I must be laughd at
If or for nothing or a little I
Should say myself offended and with you
Chiefly i the world more laughd at that I should
Once name you derogately when to sound your name
It not concernd me
My being in Egypt Caesar
What wast to you
No more than my residing here at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt yet if you there
Might be my question
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
By what did here befal me Your wife and brother
Made wars upon me and their contestation
Was theme for you you were the word of war
You do mistake your business my brother never
And have my learning from some true reports
That drew their swords with you Did he not rather
Discredit my authority with yours
And make the wars alike against my stomach
Having alike your cause Of this my letters
Before did satisfy you If youll patch a quarrel
As matter whole you have not to make it with
It must not be with this
You praise yourself
By laying defects of judgment to me but
You patchd up your excuses
Not so not so
I know you could not lack I am certain ont
Very necessity of this thought that I
Your partner in the cause gainst which he fought
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Which fronted mine own peace As for my wife
I would you had her spirit in such another
The third o the world is yours which with a snaffle
You may pace easy but not such a wife
Would we had all such wives that the men might go
to wars with the women
So much uncurbable her garboils Caesar
Made out of her impatience which not wanted
Shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant
Did you too much disquiet for that you must
But say I could not help it
I wrote to you
When rioting in Alexandria you
Did pocket up my letters and with taunts
Did gibe my missive out of audience
Sir
He fell upon me ere admitted then
Three kings I had newly feasted and did want
Of what I was i the morning but next day
I told him of myself which was as much
As to have askd him pardon Let this fellow
Be nothing of our strife if we contend
Out of our question wipe him
You have broken
The article of your oath which you shall never
Have tongue to charge me with
Soft Caesar
No
Lepidus let him speak
The honour is sacred which he talks on now
Supposing that I lackd it But on Caesar
The article of my oath
To lend me arms and aid when I required them
The which you both denied
Neglected rather
And then when poisond hours had bound me up
From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may
Ill play the penitent to you but mine honesty
Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
Work without it Truth is that Fulvia
To have me out of Egypt made wars here
For which myself the ignorant motive do
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
To stoop in such a case
Tis noble spoken
If it might please you to enforce no further
The griefs between ye to forget them quite
Were to remember that the present need
Speaks to atone you
Worthily spoken Mecaenas
Or if you borrow one anothers love for the
instant you may when you hear no more words of
Pompey return it again you shall have time to
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
Thou art a soldier only speak no more
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot
You wrong this presence therefore speak no more
Go to then your considerate stone
I do not much dislike the matter but
The manner of his speech fort cannot be
We shall remain in friendship our conditions
What hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
O the world I would pursue it
Give me leave Caesar
Speak Agrippa
Thou hast a sister by the mothers side
Admired Octavia great Mark Antony
Is now a widower
Say not so Agrippa
If Cleopatra heard you your reproof
Were well deserved of rashness
I am not married Caesar let me hear
Agrippa further speak
To hold you in perpetual amity
To make you brothers and to knit your hearts
With an unslipping  knot take Antony
Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter By this marriage
All little jealousies which now seem great
And all great fears which now import their dangers
Would then be nothing truths would be tales
Where now half tales be truths her love to both
Would each to other and all loves to both
Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke
For tis a studied not a present thought
By duty ruminated
Will Caesar speak
Not till he hears how Antony is touchd
With what is spoke already
What power is in Agrippa
If I would say Agrippa be it so
To make this good
The power of Caesar and
His power unto Octavia
May I never
To this good purpose that so fairly shows
Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs
There is my hand
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
Fly off our loves again
Happily amen
I did not think to draw my sword gainst Pompey
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me I must thank him only
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report
At heel of that defy him
Time calls upons
Of us must Pompey presently be sought
Or else he seeks out us
Where lies he
About the mount Misenum
What is his strength by land
Great and increasing but by sea
He is an absolute master
So is the fame
Would we had spoke together Haste we for it
Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
The business we have talkd of
With most gladness
And do invite you to my sisters view
Whither straight Ill lead you
Let us Lepidus
Not lack your company
Noble Antony
Not sickness should detain me
Flourish Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY and LEPIDUS
Welcome from Egypt sir
Half the heart of Caesar worthy Mecaenas My
honourable friend Agrippa
Good Enobarbus
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
digested You stayed well by t in Egypt
Ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and
made the night light with drinking
Eight wildboars roasted whole at a breakfast and
but twelve persons there is this true
This was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more
monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
Shes a most triumphant lady if report be square to
her
When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up
his heart upon the river of Cydnus
There she appeared indeed or my reporter devised
well for her
I will tell you
The barge she sat in like a burnishd throne
Burnd on the water the poop was beaten gold
Purple the sails and so perfumed that
The winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
The water which they beat to follow faster
As amorous of their strokes For her own person
It beggard all description she did lie
In her pavilionclothofgold of tissue
Oerpicturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids
With diverscolourd fans whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
And what they undid did
O rare for Antony
Her gentlewomen like the Nereides
So many mermaids tended her i the eyes
And made their bends adornings at the helm
A seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands
That yarely frame the office From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast
Her people out upon her and Antony
Enthroned i the marketplace did sit alone
Whistling to the air which but for vacancy
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
And made a gap in nature
Rare Egyptian
Upon her landing Antony sent to her
Invited her to supper she replied
It should be better he became her guest
Which she entreated our courteous Antony
Whom neer the word of No woman heard speak
Being barberd ten times oer goes to the feast
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only
Royal wench
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed
He ploughd her and she croppd
I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street
And having lost her breath she spoke and panted
That she did make defect perfection
And breathless power breathe forth
Now Antony must leave her utterly
Never he will not
Age cannot wither her nor custom stale
Her infinite variety other women cloy
The appetites they feed but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies for vilest things
Become themselves in her that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish
If beauty wisdom modesty can settle
The heart of Antony Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him
Let us go
Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest
Whilst you abide here
Humbly sir I thank you
Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY OCTAVIUS CAESAR OCTAVIA between them and Attendants
The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom
All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you
Good night sir My Octavia
Read not my blemishes in the worlds report
I have not kept my square but that to come
Shall all be done by the rule Good night dear lady
Good night sir
Good night
Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA
Enter Soothsayer
Now sirrah you do wish yourself in Egypt
Would I had never come from thence nor you Thither
If you can your reason
I see it in
My motion have it not in my tongue but yet
Hie you to Egypt again
Say to me
Whose fortunes shall rise higher Caesars or mine
Caesars
Therefore O Antony stay not by his side
Thy demon thats thy spirit which keeps thee is
Noble courageous high unmatchable
Where Caesars is not but near him thy angel
Becomes a fear as being oerpowerd therefore
Make space enough between you
Speak this no more
To none but thee no more but when to thee
If thou dost play with him at any game
Thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck
He beats thee gainst the odds thy lustre thickens
When he shines by I say again thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him
But he away tis noble
Get thee gone
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him
Exit Soothsayer
He shall to Parthia Be it art or hap
He hath spoken true the very dice obey him
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance if we draw lots he speeds
His cocks do win the battle still of mine
When it is all to nought and his quails ever
Beat mine inhoopd at odds I will to Egypt
And though I make this marriage for my peace
I the east my pleasure lies

Rich pearls upon thee

Flourish Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door  with drum and trumpet at another OCTAVIUS CAESAR  MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS MECAENAS with Soldiers marching
Your hostages I have so have you mine
And we shall talk before we fight
Most meet
That first we come to words and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent
Which if thou hast considerd let us know
If twill tie up thy discontented sword
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here
To you all three
The senators alone of this great world
Wherefore my father should revengers want
Having a son and friends since Julius Caesar
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted
There saw you labouring for him What wast
That moved pale Cassius to conspire and what
Made the allhonourd honest Roman Brutus
With the armd rest courtiers and beauteous freedom
To drench the Capitol but that they would
Have one man but a man And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy at whose burthen
The angerd ocean foams with which I meant
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father
Take your time
Thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails
Well speak with thee at sea at land thou knowst
How much we do oercount thee
At land indeed
Thou dost oercount me of my fathers house
But since the cuckoo builds not for himself
Remain int as thou mayst
Be pleased to tell us
For this is from the presenthow you take
The offers we have sent you
Theres the point
Which do not be entreated to but weigh
What it is worth embraced
And what may follow
To try a larger fortune
You have made me offer
Of Sicily Sardinia and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates then to send
Measures of wheat to Rome this greed upon
To part with unhackd edges and bear back
Our targes undinted
Thats our offer
Know then
I came before you here a man prepared
To take this offer but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience though I lose
The praise of it by telling you must know
When Caesar and your brother were at blows
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly
I have heard it Pompey
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you
Let me have your hand
I did not think sir to have met you here
The beds i the east are soft and thanks to you
That calld me timelier than my purpose hither
For I have gaind by t
Since I saw you last
There is a change upon you
Well I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face
But in my bosom shall she never come
To make my heart her vassal
Well met here
I hope so Lepidus Thus we are agreed
I crave our composition may be written
And seald between us
Thats the next to do
Well feast each other ere we part and lets
Draw lots who shall begin
That will I Pompey
No Antony take the lot but first
Or last your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there
You have heard much
I have fair meanings sir
And fair words to them
Then so much have I heard
And I have heard Apollodorus carried
No more of that he did so
What I pray you
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress
I know thee now how farest thou soldier
Well
And well am like to do for I perceive
Four feasts are toward
Let me shake thy hand
I never hated thee I have seen thee fight
When I have envied thy behavior
Sir
I never loved you much but I ha praised ye
When you have well deserved ten times as much
As I have said you did
Enjoy thy plainness
It nothing ill becomes thee
Aboard my galley I invite you all
Will you lead lords
Show us the way sir
Come
Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
Aside  Thy father Pompey would neer have
made this treatyYou and I have known sir
At sea I think
We have sir
You have done well by water
And you by land
I will praise any man that will praise me though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land
Nor what I have done by water
Yes something you can deny for your own
safety you have been a great thief by sea
And you by land
There I deny my land service But give me your
hand Menas if our eyes had authority here they
might take two thieves kissing
All mens faces are true whatsomeer their hands are
But there is never a fair woman has a true face
No slander they steal hearts
We came hither to fight with you
For my part I am sorry it is turned to a drinking
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
If he do sure he cannot weept back again
Youve said sir We looked not for Mark Antony
here pray you is he married to Cleopatra
Caesars sister is called Octavia
True sir she was the wife of Caius Marcellus
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius
Pray ye sir
Tis true
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together
If I were bound to divine of this unity I would
not prophesy so
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
marriage than the love of the parties
I think so too But you shall find the band that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity Octavia is of a
holy cold and still conversation
Who would not have his wife so
Not he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony
He will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar and as
I said before that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance Antony will use his affection where it is
he married but his occasion here
And thus it may be Come sir will you aboard
I have a health for you
I shall take it sir we have used our throats in Egypt
Come lets away
Exeunt
Music plays Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
Here theyll be man Some o their plants are
illrooted already the least wind i the world
will blow them down
Lepidus is highcoloured
They have made him drink almsdrink
As they pinch one another by the disposition he
cries out No more reconciles them to his
entreaty and himself to the drink
But it raises the greater war between him and
his discretion
Why this is to have a name in great mens
fellowship I had as lief have a reed that will do
me no service as a partisan I could not heave
To be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen
to move int are the holes where eyes should be
which pitifully disaster the cheeks
A sennet sounded Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK  ANTONY LEPIDUS POMPEY AGRIPPA MECAENAS DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS MENAS with other captains

By certain scales i the pyramid they know
By the height the lowness or the mean if dearth

Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain
And shortly comes to harvest
Youve strange serpents there

operation of your sun so is your crocodile
They are so
Sitand some wine A health to Lepidus

And hear me speak a word
Aside to MENAS  Forbear me till anon
This wine for Lepidus
What manner o thing is your crocodile
It is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad
as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is
and moves with its own organs it lives by that
which nourisheth it and the elements once out of
it it transmigrates
What colour is it of
Of it own colour too
Tis a strange serpent
Tis so And the tears of it are wet
Will this description satisfy him
With the health that Pompey gives him else he is a
very epicure
Aside to MENAS  Go hang sir hang Tell me of
that away
Do as I bid you Wheres this cup I calld for
Aside to POMPEY  If for the sake of merit thou

I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes
Thou hast served me with much faith Whats else to say
Be jolly lords
These quicksands Lepidus
Keep off them for you sink
Wilt thou be lord of all the world
What sayst thou
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world Thats twice
How should that be
But entertain it
And though thou think me poor I am the man
Will give thee all the world
Hast thou drunk well
Now Pompey I have kept me from the cup
Thou art if thou darest be the earthly Jove
Whateer the ocean pales or sky inclips
Is thine if thou wilt hat
Show me which way
These three worldsharers these competitors
Are in thy vessel let me cut the cable
And when we are put off fall to their throats
All there is thine
Ah this thou shouldst have done
And not have spoke ont In me tis villany
In theet had been good service Thou must know
Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour
Mine honour it Repent that eer thy tongue
I should have found it afterwards well done
But must condemn it now Desist and drink
Aside  For this
Ill never follow thy palld fortunes more
Who seeks and will not take when once tis offerd
Shall never find it more
This health to Lepidus
Bear him ashore Ill pledge it for him Pompey
Heres to thee Menas
Enobarbus welcome
Fill till the cup be hid
Theres a strong fellow Menas
Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS
Why
A bears the third part of the world man seest

The third part then is drunk would it were all
That it might go on wheels
Drink thou increase the reels
Come
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast
It ripens towards it Strike the vessels ho
Here is to Caesar
I could well forbeart
Its monstrous labour when I wash my brain
And it grows fouler
Be a child o the time
Possess it Ill make answer
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one
Ha my brave emperor
To MARK ANTONY
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
And celebrate our drink
Lets hat good soldier
Come lets all take hands
Till that the conquering wine hath steepd our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe
All take hands
Make battery to our ears with the loud music
The while Ill place you then the boy shall sing
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley
Music plays DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
THE SONG
Come thou monarch of the vine
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne
In thy fats our cares be drownd
With thy grapes our hairs be crownd
Cup us till the world go round
Cup us till the world go round
What would you more Pompey good night Good brother
Let me request you off our graver business
Frowns at this levity Gentle lords lets part
You see we have burnt our cheeks strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost
Antickd us all What needs more words Good night
Good Antony your hand
Ill try you on the shore
And shall sir gives your hand
O Antony
You have my fathers houseBut what we are friends
Come down into the boat
Take heed you fall not
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS
Menas Ill not on shore

Exeunt
Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph with SILIUS  and other Romans Officers and Soldiers the dead body of PACORUS borne before him
Now darting Parthia art thou struck and now
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus death
Make me revenger Bear the kings sons body
Before our army Thy Pacorus Orodes
Pays this for Marcus Crassus
Noble Ventidius
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
The fugitive Parthians follow spur through Media
Mesopotamia and the shelters whither
The routed fly so thy grand captain Antony
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head
O Silius Silius
I have done enough a lower place note well
Better to leave undone than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serves away
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person Sossius
One of my place in Syria his lieutenant
For quick accumulation of renown
Which he achieved by the minute lost his favour
Who does i the wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captains captain and ambition
The soldiers virtue rather makes choice of loss
Than gain which darkens him
I could do more to do Antonius good
But twould offend him and in his offence
Should my performance perish
Thou hast Ventidius
that
Without the which a soldier and his sword
Grants scarce distinction Thou wilt write to Antony
Ill humbly signify what in his name
That magical word of war we have effected
How with his banners and his wellpaid ranks
The neeryetbeaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o the field
Where is he now
He purposeth to Athens whither with what haste
The weight we must convey withs will permit
We shall appear before him On there pass along
Exeunt
Enter AGRIPPA at one door DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another
What are the brothers parted
They have dispatchd with Pompey he is gone
The other three are sealing Octavia weeps
To part from Rome Caesar is sad and Lepidus
Since Pompeys feast as Menas says is troubled
With the green sickness
Tis a noble Lepidus
A very fine one O how he loves Caesar
Nay but how dearly he adores Mark Antony
Caesar Why hes the Jupiter of men
Whats Antony The god of Jupiter
Spake you of Caesar How the nonpareil
O Antony O thou Arabian bird
Would you praise Caesar say Caesar go no further
Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises
But he loves Caesar best yet he loves Antony
Ho hearts tongues figures scribes bards
poets cannot
Think speak cast write sing number ho
His love to Antony But as for Caesar
Kneel down kneel down and wonder
Both he loves
They are his shards and he their beetle
Trumpets within
So
This is to horse Adieu noble Agrippa
Good fortune worthy soldier and farewell
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS and OCTAVIA
No further sir
You take from me a great part of myself
Use me well in t Sister prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof Most noble Antony
Let not the piece of virtue which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love
To keep it builded be the ram to batter
The fortress of it for better might we
Have loved without this mean if on both parts
This be not cherishd
Make me not offended
In your distrust
I have said
You shall not find
Though you be therein curious the least cause
For what you seem to fear so the gods keep you
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends
We will here part
Farewell my dearest sister fare thee well
The elements be kind to thee and make
Thy spirits all of comfort fare thee well
My noble brother
The April s in her eyes it is loves spring
And these the showers to bring it on Be cheerful
Sir look well to my husbands house and

Her tongue will not obey her heart nor can
Her heart inform her tonguethe swans

That stands upon the swell at full of tide
And neither way inclines
Aside to AGRIPPA  Will Caesar weep
Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  He has a cloud in s face
Aside to AGRIPPA  He were the worse for that
were he a horse
So is he being a man
Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Why Enobarbus
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead
He cried almost to roaring and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain
Aside to AGRIPPA  That year indeed he was
troubled with a rheum
What willingly he did confound he waild
Believet till I wept too
No sweet Octavia
You shall hear from me still the time shall not
Outgo my thinking on you
Come sir come
Ill wrestle with you in my strength of love
Look here I have you thus I let you go
And give you to the gods

To thy fair way

Come hither sir
Good majesty
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased
That Herods head
Ill have but how when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it Come thou near
Most gracious majesty
Didst thou behold Octavia
Ay dread queen
Where
Madam in Rome
I lookd her in the face and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony
Is she as tall as me
She is not madam
Didst hear her speak is she shrilltongued or low
Madam I heard her speak she is lowvoiced
Thats not so good he cannot like her long
Like her O Isis tis impossible
I think so Charmian dull of tongue and dwarfish
What majesty is in her gait Remember
If eer thou lookdst on majesty
She creeps
Her motion and her station are as one
She shows a body rather than a life
A statue than a breather
Is this certain
Or I have no observance
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note
Hes very knowing
I do perceivet theres nothing in her yet
The fellow has good judgment
Excellent
Guess at her years I prithee
Madam
She was a widow
Widow Charmian hark
And I do think shes thirty
Bearst thou her face in mind ist long or round
Round even to faultiness
For the most part too they are foolish that are so
Her hair what colour
Brown madam and her forehead
As low as she would wish it
Theres gold for thee
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill
I will employ thee back again I find thee
Most fit for business go make thee ready
Our letters are prepared
Exit Messenger
A proper man
Indeed he is so I repent me much
That so I harried him Why methinks by him
This creatures no such thing
Nothing madam
The man hath seen some majesty and should know
Hath he seen majesty Isis else defend
And serving you so long
I have one thing more to ask him yet good Charmian
But tis no matter thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write All may be well enough
I warrant you madam
Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA
Nay nay Octavia not only that
That were excusable that and thousands more
Of semblable importbut he hath waged
New wars gainst Pompey made his will and read it
To public ear
Spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour cold and sickly
He vented them most narrow measure lent me
When the best hint was given him he not tookt
Or did it from his teeth
O my good lord
Believe not all or if you must believe
Stomach not all A more unhappy lady
If this division chance neer stood between
Praying for both parts
The good gods me presently
When I shall pray O bless my lord and husband
Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
O bless my brother Husband win win brother
Prays and destroys the prayer no midway
Twixt these extremes at all
Gentle Octavia
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
Best to preserve it if I lose mine honour
I lose myself better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless But as you requested
Yourself shall go between s the mean time lady
Ill raise the preparation of a war
Shall stain your brother make your soonest haste
So your desires are yours
Thanks to my lord
The Jove of power make me most weak most weak
Your reconciler Wars twixt you twain would be
As if the world should cleave and that slain men
Should solder up the rift
When it appears to you where this begins
Turn your displeasure that way for our faults
Can never be so equal that your love
Can equally move with them Provide your going
Choose your own company and command what cost
Your heart has mind to
Exeunt
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS meeting

Pompey presently denied him rivality would not let
resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly
wrote to Pompey upon his own appeal seizes him so
the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine
Then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more
And throw between them all the food thou hast
Theyll grind the one the other Wheres Antony
Hes walking in the gardenthus and spurns
The rush that lies before him cries Fool Lepidus
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murderd Pompey

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR AGRIPPA and MECAENAS
Contemning Rome he has done all this and more
In Alexandria heres the manner of t
I the marketplace on a tribunal silverd
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthroned at the feet sat
Caesarion whom they call my fathers son
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt made her
Of lower Syria Cyprus Lydia
Absolute queen
This in the public eye

His sons he there proclaimd the kings of kings
Great Media Parthia and Armenia
He gave to Alexander to Ptolemy he assignd
Syria Cilicia and Phoenicia she
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appeard and oft before gave audience
As tis reported so
Let Rome be thus Informd
Who queasy with his insolence
Already will their good thoughts call from him
The people know it and have now received
His accusations
Who does he accuse
Caesar and that having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoild we had not rated him
His part o the isle then does he say he lent me
Some shipping unrestored lastly he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be deposed and being that we detain
All his revenue
Sir this should be answerd
Tis done already and the messenger gone
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel
That he his high authority abused
And did deserve his change for what I have conquerd
I grant him part but then in his Armenia
And other of his conquerd kingdoms I
Demand the like
Hell never yield to that
Nor must not then be yielded to in this
Enter OCTAVIA with her train
Hail Caesar and my lord hail most dear Caesar
That ever I should call thee castaway
You have not calld me so nor have you cause
Why have you stoln upon us thus You come not
Like Caesars sister the wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear the trees by the way
Should have borne men and expectation fainted
Longing for what it had not nay the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven
Raised by your populous troops but you are come
A marketmaid to Rome and have prevented
The ostentation of our love which left unshown
Is often left unloved we should have met you
By sea and land supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting
Good my lord
To come thus was I not constraind but did
On my free will My lord Mark Antony
Hearing that you prepared for war acquainted
My grieved ear withal whereon I beggd
His pardon for return
Which soon he granted
Being an obstruct tween his lust and him
Do not say so my lord
I have eyes upon him
And his affairs come to me on the wind
Where is he now
My lord in Athens
No my most wronged sister Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her He hath given his empire
Up to a whore who now are levying
The kings o the earth for war he hath assembled
Bocchus the king of Libya Archelaus
Of Cappadocia Philadelphos king
Of Paphlagonia the Thracian king Adallas
King Malchus of Arabia King of Pont
Herod of Jewry Mithridates king
Of Comagene Polemon and Amyntas
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia
With a more larger list of sceptres
Ay me most wretched
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
That do afflict each other
Welcome hither
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth
Till we perceived both how you were wrong led
And we in negligent danger Cheer your heart
Be you not troubled with the time which drives
Oer your content these strong necessities
But let determined things to destiny
Hold unbewaild their way Welcome to Rome
Nothing more dear to me You are abused
Beyond the mark of thought and the high gods
To do you justice make them ministers
Of us and those that love you Best of comfort
And ever welcome to us
Welcome lady
Welcome dear madam
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you
Only the adulterous Antony most large
In his abominations turns you off
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
That noises it against us
Is it so sir
Most certain Sister welcome pray you
Be ever known to patience my dearst sister
Exeunt
Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I will be even with thee doubt it not
But why why why
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars
And sayst it is not fit
Well is it is it
If not denounced against us why should not we
Be there in person
Aside  Well I could reply
If we should serve with horse and mares together
The horse were merely lost the mares would bear
A soldier and his horse
What ist you say
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony
Take from his heart take from his brain
froms time
What should not then be spared He is already
Traduced for levity and tis said in Rome
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
Manage this war
Sink Rome and their tongues rot
That speak against us A charge we bear i the war
And as the president of my kingdom will
Appear there for a man Speak not against it
I will not stay behind
Nay I have done
Here comes the emperor
Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS
Is it not strange Canidius
That from Tarentum and Brundusium
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea
And take in Toryne You have heard ont sweet
Celerity is never more admired
Than by the negligent
A good rebuke
Which might have well becomed the best of men
To taunt at slackness Canidius we
Will fight with him by sea
By sea what else
Why will my lord do so
For that he dares us tot
So hath my lord dared him to single fight
Ay and to wage this battle at Pharsalia
Where Caesar fought with Pompey but these offers
Which serve not for his vantage be shakes off
And so should you
Your ships are not well mannd
Your mariners are muleters reapers people
Ingrossd by swift impress in Caesars fleet
Are those that often have gainst Pompey fought
Their ships are yare yours heavy no disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea
Being prepared for land
By sea by sea
Most worthy sir you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land
Of warmarkd footmen leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge quite forego
The way which promises assurance and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
From firm security
Ill fight at sea
I have sixty sails Caesar none better
Our overplus of shipping will we burn
Beat the approaching Caesar But if we fail
We then can dot at land
Enter a Messenger
Thy business
The news is true my lord he is descried
Caesar has taken Toryne
Can he be there in person tis impossible
Strange that power should be Canidius
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land
And our twelve thousand horse Well to our ship
Away my Thetis
Enter a Soldier
How now worthy soldier
O noble emperor do not fight by sea
Trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds Let the Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go aducking we
Have used to conquer standing on the earth
And fighting foot to foot
Well well away
Exeunt MARK ANTONY QUEEN CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
By Hercules I think I am i the right
Not in the power ont so our leaders led
And we are womens men
You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole do you not
Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius
Publicola and Caelius are for sea
But we keep whole by land This speed of Caesars
Carries beyond belief
While he was yet in Rome
Beguiled all spies
Whos his lieutenant hear you
They say one Taurus
Well I know the man
Enter a Messenger
The emperor calls Canidius
With news the times with labour and throes forth
Each minute some
Exeunt
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and TAURUS with his army marching

Till we have done at sea Do not exceed
The prescript of this scroll our fortune lies
Upon this jump
Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Set we our squadrons on yond side o the hill
In eye of Caesars battle from which place
We may the number of the ships behold
And so proceed accordingly
Exeunt
CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over  the stage and TAURUS the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS  CAESAR the other way After their going in is heard the noise of a seafight
Alarum Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Naught naught all naught I can behold no longer
The Antoniad the Egyptian admiral
With all their sixty fly and turn the rudder
To seet mine eyes are blasted
Enter SCARUS
Gods and goddesses
All the whole synod of them
Whats thy passion
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance we have kissd away
Kingdoms and provinces
How appears the fight
On our side like the tokend pestilence
Where death is sure Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt
Whom leprosy oertakei the midst o the fight
When vantage like a pair of twins appeard
Both as the same or rather ours the elder
The breese upon her like a cow in June
Hoists sails and flies
That I beheld
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
Endure a further view
She once being loofd
The noble ruin of her magic Antony
Claps on his seawing and like a doting mallard
Leaving the fight in height flies after her
Experience manhood honour neer before
Did violate so itself
Alack alack
Enter CANIDIUS
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath
And sinks most lamentably Had our general
Been what he knew himself it had gone well
O he has given example for our flight
Most grossly by his own
Ay are you thereabouts
Why then good night indeed
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled
Tis easy tot and there I will attend
What further comes
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse six kings already
Show me the way of yielding
Ill yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony though my reason
Sits in the wind against me
Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants
Hark the land bids me tread no more upont
It is ashamed to bear me Friends come hither
I am so lated in the world that I
Have lost my way for ever I have a ship
Laden with gold take that divide it fly
And make your peace with Caesar
Fly not we
I have fled myself and have instructed cowards
To run and show their shoulders Friends be gone
I have myself resolved upon a course
Which has no need of you be gone
My treasures in the harbour take it O
I followd that I blush to look upon
My very hairs do mutiny for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness and they them
For fear and doting Friends be gone you shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you Pray you look not sad
Nor make replies of loathness take the hint
Which my despair proclaims let that be left
Which leaves itself to the seaside straightway
I will possess you of that ship and treasure
Leave me I pray a little pray you now
Nay do so for indeed I have lost command
Therefore I pray you Ill see you by and by
Sits down
Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS EROS following
Nay gentle madam to him comfort him
Do most dear queen
Do why what else
Let me sit down O Juno
No no no no no
See you here sir
O fie fie fie
Madam
Madam O good empress
Sir sir
Yes my lord yes he at Philippi kept
His sword een like a dancer while I struck
The lean and wrinkled Cassius and twas I
That the mad Brutus ended he alone
In the brave squares of war yet nowNo matter
Ah stand by
The queen my lord the queen
Go to him madam speak to him
He is unqualitied with very shame
Well then sustain him O
Most noble sir arise the queen approaches
Her heads declined and death will seize her but
Your comfort makes the rescue
I have offended reputation
A most unnoble swerving
Sir the queen
O whither hast thou led me Egypt See
How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
By looking back what I have left behind
Stroyd in dishonour
O my lord my lord
Forgive my fearful sails I little thought
You would have followd
Egypt thou knewst too well
My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings
And thou shouldst tow me after oer my spirit
Thy full supremacy thou knewst and that
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
Command me
O my pardon
Now I must
To the young man send humble treaties dodge
And palter in the shifts of lowness who
With half the bulk o the world playd as I pleased
Making and marring fortunes You did know
How much you were my conqueror and that
My sword made weak by my affection would
Obey it on all cause
Pardon pardon
Fall not a tear I say one of them rates
All that is won and lost give me a kiss
Even this repays me We sent our schoolmaster
Is he come back Love I am full of lead
Some wine within there and our viands Fortune knows
We scorn her most when most she offers blows
Exeunt
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR DOLABELLA THYREUS with others
Let him appear thats come from Antony
Know you him
Caesar tis his schoolmaster
An argument that he is pluckd when hither
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by
Enter EUPHRONIUS ambassador from MARK ANTONY
Approach and speak
Such as I am I come from Antony
I was of late as petty to his ends
As is the morndew on the myrtleleaf
To his grand sea
Bet so declare thine office
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and
Requires to live in Egypt which not granted
He lessens his requests and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth
A private man in Athens this for him
Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness
Submits her to thy might and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs
Now hazarded to thy grace
For Antony
I have no ears to his request The queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail so she
From Egypt drive her alldisgraced friend
Or take his life there this if she perform
She shall not sue unheard So to them both
Fortune pursue thee
Bring him through the bands
Exit EUPHRONIUS
To THYREUS
From Antony win Cleopatra promise
And in our name what she requires add more
From thine invention offers women are not
In their best fortunes strong but want will perjure
The neer touchd vestal try thy cunning Thyreus
Make thine own edict for thy pains which we
Will answer as a law
Caesar I go
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw
In every power that moves
Caesar I shall
Exeunt
Enter CLEOPATRA DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS CHARMIAN and IRAS
What shall we do Enobarbus
Think and die
Is Antony or we in fault for this
Antony only that would make his will
Lord of his reason What though you fled
From that great face of war whose several ranges
Frighted each other why should he follow
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nickd his captainship at such a point
When half to half the world opposed he being
The meered question twas a shame no less
Than was his loss to course your flying flags
And leave his navy gazing
Prithee peace
Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS the Ambassador
Is that his answer
Ay my lord
The queen shall then have courtesy so she
Will yield us up
He says so
Let her knowt
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities
That head my lord
To him again tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him from which the world should note
Something particular his coin ships legions
May be a cowards whose ministers would prevail
Under the service of a child as soon
As i the command of Caesar I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart
And answer me declined sword against sword
Ourselves alone Ill write it follow me
Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
Aside  Yes like enough highbattled Caesar will
Unstate his happiness and be staged to the show
Against a sworder I see mens judgments are
A parcel of their fortunes and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them
To suffer all alike That he should dream
Knowing all measures the full Caesar will
Answer his emptiness Caesar thou hast subdued
His judgment too
Enter an Attendant
A messenger from CAESAR
What no more ceremony See my women
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
That kneeld unto the buds Admit him sir
Exit Attendant
Aside  Mine honesty and I begin to square
The loyalty well held to fools does make
Our faith mere folly yet he that can endure
To follow with allegiance a falln lord
Does conquer him that did his master conquer
And earns a place i the story
Enter THYREUS
Caesars will
Hear it apart
None but friends say boldly
So haply are they friends to Antony
He needs as many sir as Caesar has
Or needs not us If Caesar please our master
Will leap to be his friend for us you know
Whose he is we are and that is Caesars
So
Thus then thou most renownd Caesar entreats
Not to consider in what case thou standst
Further than he is Caesar
Go on right royal
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love but as you feard him
O
The scars upon your honour therefore he
Does pity as constrained blemishes
Not as deserved
He is a god and knows
What is most right mine honour was not yielded
But conquerd merely
Aside             To be sure of that
I will ask Antony Sir sir thou art so leaky
That we must leave thee to thy sinking for
Thy dearest quit thee
Exit
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him for he partly begs
To be desired to give It much would please him
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon but it would warm his spirits
To hear from me you had left Antony
And put yourself under his shrowd
The universal landlord
Whats your name
My name is Thyreus
Most kind messenger
Say to great Caesar this in deputation
I kiss his conquering hand tell him I am prompt
To lay my crown at s feet and there to kneel
Tell him from his allobeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt
Tis your noblest course
Wisdom and fortune combating together
If that the former dare but what it can
No chance may shake it Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand
Your Caesars father oft
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in
Bestowd his lips on that unworthy place
As it raind kisses
Reenter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Favours by Jove that thunders
What art thou fellow
One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest
To have command obeyd
Aside               You will be whippd
Approach there Ah you kite Now gods
and devils
Authority melts from me of late when I cried Ho
Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth
And cry Your will Have you no ears I am
Antony yet
Enter Attendants
Take hence this Jack and whip him
Aside  Tis better playing with a lions whelp
Than with an old one dying
Moon and stars
Whip him Weret twenty of the greatest tributaries
That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them
So saucy with the hand of she herewhats her name
Since she was Cleopatra Whip him fellows
Till like a boy you see him cringe his face
And whine aloud for mercy take him hence
Mark Antony
Tug him away being whippd
Bring him again this Jack of Caesars shall
Bear us an errand to him
Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS
You were half blasted ere I knew you ha
Have I my pillow left unpressd in Rome
Forborne the getting of a lawful race
And by a gem of women to be abused
By one that looks on feeders
Good my lord
You have been a boggler ever
But when we in our viciousness grow hard
O misery ontthe wise gods seel our eyes
In our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
Adore our errors laugh ats while we strut
To our confusion
O ist come to this
I found you as a morsel cold upon
Dead Caesars trencher nay you were a fragment
Of Cneius Pompeys besides what hotter hours
Unregisterd in vulgar fame you have
Luxuriously pickd out for I am sure
Though you can guess what temperance should be
You know not what it is
Wherefore is this
To let a fellow that will take rewards
And say God quit you be familiar with
My playfellow your hand this kingly seal
And plighter of high hearts O that I were
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
The horned herd for I have savage cause
And to proclaim it civilly were like
A halterd neck which does the hangman thank
For being yare about him
Reenter Attendants with THYREUS
Is he whippd
Soundly my lord
Cried he and beggd a pardon
He did ask favour
If that thy father live let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
To follow Caesar in his triumph since
Thou hast been whippd for following him henceforth
The white hand of a lady fever thee
Shake thou to look on t Get thee back to Caesar
Tell him thy entertainment look thou say
He makes me angry with him for he seems
Proud and disdainful harping on what I am
Not what he knew I was he makes me angry
And at this time most easy tis to dot
When my good stars that were my former guides
Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
Into the abysm of hell If he mislike
My speech and what is done tell him he has
Hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
As he shall like to quit me urge it thou
Hence with thy stripes begone
Exit THYREUS
Have you done yet
Alack our terrene moon
Is now eclipsed and it portends alone
The fall of Antony
I must stay his time
To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes
With one that ties his points
Not know me yet
Coldhearted toward me
Ah dear if I be so
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail
And poison it in the source and the first stone
Drop in my neck as it determines so
Dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite
Till by degrees the memory of my womb
Together with my brave Egyptians all
By the discandying of this pelleted storm
Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile
Have buried them for prey
I am satisfied
Caesar sits down in Alexandria where
I will oppose his fate Our force by land
Hath nobly held our severd navy too
Have knit again and fleet threatening most sealike
Where hast thou been my heart Dost thou hear lady
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips I will appear in blood
I and my sword will earn our chronicle
Theres hope int yet
Thats my brave lord
I will be treblesinewd hearted breathed
And fight maliciously for when mine hours
Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives
Of me for jests but now Ill set my teeth
And send to darkness all that stop me Come
Lets have one other gaudy night call to me
All my sad captains fill our bowls once more
Lets mock the midnight bell
It is my birthday
I had thought to have held it poor but since my lord
Is Antony again I will be Cleopatra
We will yet do well
Call all his noble captains to my lord
Do so well speak to them and tonight Ill force
The wine peep through their scars Come on my queen
Theres sap int yet The next time I do fight
Ill make death love me for I will contend
Even with his pestilent scythe
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Now hell outstare the lightning To be furious
Is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood
The dove will peck the estridge and I see still
A diminution in our captains brain
Restores his heart when valour preys on reason
It eats the sword it fights with I will seek
Some way to leave him
Exit
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR AGRIPPA and MECAENAS with his Army OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter
He calls me boy and chides as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt my messenger
He hath whippd with rods dares me to personal combat
Caesar to Antony let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die meantime
Laugh at his challenge
Caesar must think
When one so great begins to rage hes hunted
Even to falling Give him no breath but now
Made good guard for itself
Let our best heads
Know that tomorrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight within our files there are
Of those that served Mark Antony but late
Enough to fetch him in See it done

And they have earnd the waste Poor Antony

tricks which sorrow shoots
Out of the mind
And thou art honest too

And all of you clappd up together in
An Antony that I might do you service
So good as you have done
The gods forbid
Well my good fellows wait on me tonight
Scant not my cups and make as much of me
As when mine empire was your fellow too
And sufferd my command
Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  What does he mean
Aside to CLEOPATRA  To make his followers weep
Tend me tonight
May be it is the period of your duty
Haply you shall not see me more or if
A mangled shadow perchance tomorrow
Youll serve another master I look on you
As one that takes his leave Mine honest friends
I turn you not away but like a master
Married to your good service stay till death
Tend me tonight two hours I ask no more
And the gods yield you fort

And I an ass am onioneyed for shame
Transform us not to women

Grace grow where those drops fall

Where rather Ill expect victorious life
Than death and honour Lets to supper come
And drown consideration

When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent
Enobarbus
Peace
Hark further
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me
That life a very rebel to my will
May hang no longer on me throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault
Which being dried with grief will break to powder
And finish all foul thoughts O Antony
Nobler than my revolt is infamous
Forgive me in thine own particular
But let the world rank me in register
A masterleaver and a fugitive
O Antony O Antony
Dies
Lets speak To him
Lets hear him for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar
Lets do so But he sleeps
Swoons rather for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep
Go we to him
Awake sir awake speak to us
Hear you sir
The hand of death hath raught him
Drums afar off
Hark the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers Let us bear him
To the court of guard he is of note our hour

Come on then
He may recover yet
Exeunt with the body
Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS with their Army

And look on their endeavour

Straight how tis like to go
Exit
Swallows have built
In Cleopatras sails their nests the augurers
Say they know not they cannot tell look grimly
And dare not speak their knowledge Antony
Is valiant and dejected and by starts
His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
Of what he has and has not
Alarum afar off as at a seafight
Reenter MARK ANTONY
All is lost
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me
My fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together
Like friends long lost Tripleturnd whore
tis thou
Hast sold me to this novice and my heart
Makes only wars on thee Bid them all fly
For when I am revenged upon my charm
I have done all Bid them all fly begone
Exit SCARUS
O sun thy uprise shall I see no more
Fortune and Antony part here even here
Do we shake hands All come to this The hearts
That spanield me at heels to whom I gave
Their wishes do discandy melt their sweets
On blossoming Caesar and this pine is barkd
That overtoppd them all Betrayd I am
O this false soul of Egypt this grave charm
Whose eye beckd forth my wars and calld them home
Whose bosom was my crownet my chief end
Like a right gipsy hath at fast and loose
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss
What Eros Eros
Enter CLEOPATRA
Ah thou spell Avaunt
Why is my lord enraged against his love
Vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving
And blemish Caesars triumph Let him take thee
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians
Follow his chariot like the greatest spot
Of all thy sex most monsterlike be shown
For poorst diminutives for doits and let
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
With her prepared nails
Exit CLEOPATRA
Tis well thourt gone
If it be well to live but better twere
Thou fellst into my fury for one death
Might have prevented many Eros ho
The shirt of Nessus is upon me teach me
Alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o the moon
And with those hands that graspd the heaviest club
Subdue my worthiest self The witch shall die
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me and I fall
Under this plot she dies fort Eros ho
Exit
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and MARDIAN
Help me my women O he is more mad

There lock yourself and send him word you are dead
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off
To the monument
Mardian go tell him I have slain myself
Say that the last I spoke was Antony
And word it prithee piteously hence Mardian
And bring me how he takes my death
To the monument
Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS
Eros thou yet beholdst me
Ay noble lord
Sometimes we see a cloud thats dragonish
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion
A towerd citadel a pendent rock
A forked mountain or blue promontory
With trees upont that nod unto the world
And mock our eyes with air thou hast seen
these signs
They are black vespers pageants
Ay my lord
That which is now a horse even with a thought
The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct
As water is in water
It does my lord
My good knave Eros now thy captain is
Even such a body here I am Antony
Yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave
I made these wars for Egypt and the queen
Whose heart I thought I had for she had mine
Which whilst it was mine had annexd untot
A million more now lostshe Eros has
Packd cards with Caesar and falseplayd my glory
Unto an enemys triumph
Nay weep not gentle Eros there is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves
Enter MARDIAN
O thy vile lady
She has robbd me of my sword
No Antony
My mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled
With thine entirely
Hence saucy eunuch peace
She hath betrayd me and shall die the death
Death of one person can be paid but once
And that she has discharged what thou wouldst do
Is done unto thy hand the last she spake
Was Antony most noble Antony
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
The name of Antony it was divided
Between her heart and lips she renderd life
Thy name so buried in her
Dead then
Dead
Unarm Eros the long days task is done
And we must sleep
To MARDIAN
That thou departst hence safe
Does pay thy labour richly go
Exit MARDIAN
Off pluck off
The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart O cleave my sides
Heart once be stronger than thy continent
Crack thy frail case Apace Eros apace
No more a soldier bruised pieces go
You have been nobly borne From me awhile
Exit EROS
I will oertake thee Cleopatra and
Weep for my pardon So it must be for now
All length is torture since the torch is out
Lie down and stray no farther now all labour
Mars what it does yea very force entangles
Itself with strength seal then and all is done
ErosI come my queenErosStay for me
Where souls do couch on flowers well hand in hand
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze
Dido and her AEneas shall want troops
And all the haunt be ours Come Eros Eros
Reenter EROS
What would my lord
Since Cleopatra died
I have lived in such dishonour that the gods
Detest my baseness I that with my sword
Quarterd the world and oer green Neptunes back
With ships made cities condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
I am conqueror of myself Thou art sworn Eros
That when the exigent should come which now
Is come indeed when I should see behind me
The inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror that on my command
Thou then wouldst kill me dot the time is come
Thou strikest not me tis Caesar thou defeatst
Put colour in thy cheek
The gods withhold me
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts
Though enemy lost aim and could not
Eros
Wouldst thou be windowd in great Rome and see
Thy master thus with pleachd arms bending down
His corrigible neck his face subdued
To penetrative shame whilst the wheeld seat
Of fortunate Caesar drawn before him branded
His baseness that ensued
I would not seet
Come then for with a wound I must be cured
Draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country
O sir pardon me
When I did make thee free sworest thou not then
To do this when I bade thee Do it at once
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurposed Draw and come
Turn from me then that noble countenance
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies
Lo thee
Turning from him
My sword is drawn
Then let it do at once
The thing why thou hast drawn it
My dear master
My captain and my emperor let me say
Before I strike this bloody stroke farewell
Tis said man and farewell
Farewell great chief Shall I strike now
Now Eros
Why there then thus I do escape the sorrow
Of Antonys death
Kills himself
Thricenobler than myself
Thou teachest me O valiant Eros what
I should and thou couldst not My queen and Eros
Have by their brave instruction got upon me
A nobleness in record but I will be
A bridegroom in my death and run intot
As to a lovers bed Come then and Eros
Thy master dies thy scholar to do thus
Falling on his sword
I learnd of thee How not dead not dead
The guard ho O dispatch me
Enter DERCETAS and Guard
Whats the noise
I have done my work in friends O make an end
Of what I have begun
The star is falln
And time is at his period
Alas and woe
Let him that loves me strike me dead
Not I
Nor I
Nor any one
Exeunt Guard

This sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings
Shall enter me with him

Art thou there Diomed Draw thy sword and give me
Sufficing strokes for death
Most absolute lord
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee
When did she send thee
Now my lord
Where is she
Lockd in her monument She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass for when she saw
Which never shall be foundyou did suspect
She had disposed with Caesar and that your rage
Would not be purged she sent you word she was dead
But fearing since how it might work hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth and I am come
I dread too late
Too late good Diomed call my guard I prithee
What ho the emperors guard The guard what ho
Come your lord calls
Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY
Bear me good friends where Cleopatra bides
Tis the last service that I shall command you
Woe woe are we sir you may not live to wear
All your true followers out
Most heavy day
Nay good my fellows do not please sharp fate
To grace it with your sorrows bid that welcome
Which comes to punish us and we punish it
Seeming to bear it lightly Take me up
I have led you oft carry me now good friends
And have my thanks for all
Exeunt bearing MARK ANTONY
Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft with CHARMIAN and IRAS
O Charmian I will never go from hence
Be comforted dear madam
No I will not
All strange and terrible events are welcome
But comforts we despise our size of sorrow
Proportiond to our cause must be as great
As that which makes it
Enter below DIOMEDES
How now is he dead
His deaths upon him but not dead
Look out o the other side your monument
His guard have brought him thither
Enter below MARK ANTONY borne by the Guard
O sun
Burn the great sphere thou movest in
darkling stand
The varying shore o the world O Antony
Antony Antony Help Charmian help Iras help
Help friends below lets draw him hither
Peace
Not Caesars valour hath oerthrown Antony
But Antonys hath triumphd on itself
So it should be that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony but woe tis so
I am dying Egypt dying only
I here importune death awhile until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay up thy lips
I dare not dear
Dear my lord pardonI dare not
Lest I be taken not the imperious show
Of the fullfortuned Caesar ever shall
Be broochd with me if knife drugs
serpents have
Edge sting or operation I am safe
Your wife Octavia with her modest eyes
And still conclusion shall acquire no honour
Demuring upon me But come come Antony
Help me my womenwe must draw thee up
Assist good friends
O quick or I am gone
Heres sport indeed How heavy weighs my lord
Our strength is all gone into heaviness
That makes the weight had I great Junos power
The strongwingd Mercury should fetch thee up
And set thee by Joves side Yet come a little
Wishes were ever foolsO come come come
They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
And welcome welcome die where thou hast lived
Quicken with kissing had my lips that power
Thus would I wear them out
A heavy sight
I am dying Egypt dying
Give me some wine and let me speak a little
No let me speak and let me rail so high
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel
Provoked by my offence
One word sweet queen
Of Caesar seek your honour with your safety O
They do not go together
Gentle hear me
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius
My resolution and my hands Ill trust
None about Caesar
The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
Wherein I lived the greatest prince o the world
The noblest and do now not basely die
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countrymana Roman by a Roman
Valiantly vanquishd Now my spirit is going
I can no more
Noblest of men woot die
Hast thou no care of me shall I abide
In this dull world which in thy absence is
No better than a sty O see my women
MARK ANTONY dies
The crown o the earth doth melt My lord
O witherd is the garland of the war
The soldiers pole is falln young boys and girls
Are level now with men the odds is gone
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon
Faints
O quietness lady
She is dead too our sovereign
Lady
Madam
O madam madam madam
Royal Egypt Empress
Peace peace Iras
No more but een a woman and commanded
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stoln our jewel Alls but naught
Patience is scottish and impatience does
Become a dog thats mad then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death
Ere death dare come to us How do you women
What what good cheer Why how now Charmian
My noble girls Ah women women look
Our lamp is spent its out Good sirs take heart
Well bury him and then whats brave
whats noble
Lets do it after the high Roman fashion
And make death proud to take us Come away
This case of that huge spirit now is cold
Ah women women come we have no friend
But resolution and the briefest end
Exeunt those above bearing off MARK ANTONYs body

Exit
Enter DERCETAS with the sword of MARK ANTONY
Wherefore is that and what art thou that darest
Appear thus to us
I am calld Dercetas
Mark Antony I served who best was worthy
Best to be served whilst he stood up and spoke
He was my master and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters If thou please
To take me to thee as I was to him
Ill be to Caesar if thou pleasest not
I yield thee up my life
What ist thou sayst
I say O Caesar Antony is dead
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack the round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets
And citizens to their dens the death of Antony
Is not a single doom in the name lay
A moiety of the world
He is dead Caesar
Not by a public minister of justice
Nor by a hired knife but that self hand
Hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
Splitted the heart This is his sword
I robbd his wound of it behold it staind
With his most noble blood
Look you sad friends
The gods rebuke me but it is tidings
To wash the eyes of kings
And strange it is
That nature must compel us to lament
Our most persisted deeds
His taints and honours
Waged equal with him
A rarer spirit never
Did steer humanity but you gods will give us
Some faults to make us men Caesar is touchd
When such a spacious mirrors set before him
He needs must see himself
O Antony
I have followd thee to this but we do lance
Diseases in our bodies I must perforce
Have shown to thee such a declining day
Or look on thine we could not stall together
In the whole world but yet let me lament
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
That thou my brother my competitor
In top of all design my mate in empire
Friend and companion in the front of war
The arm of mine own body and the heart
Where mine his thoughts did kindlethat our stars
Unreconciliable should divide
Our equalness to this Hear me good friends
But I will tell you at some meeter season
Enter an Egyptian
The business of this man looks out of him
Well hear him what he says Whence are you
A poor Egyptian yet The queen my mistress
Confined in all she has her monument
Of thy intents desires instruction
That she preparedly may frame herself
To the way shes forced to
Bid her have good heart
She soon shall know of us by some of ours
How honourable and how kindly we
Determine for her for Caesar cannot live
To be ungentle
So the gods preserve thee
Exit
Come hither Proculeius Go and say
We purpose her no shame give her what comforts
The quality of her passion shall require
Lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke
She do defeat us for her life in Rome
Would be eternal in our triumph go

And how you find of her
Caesar I shall
Exit
Gallus go you along
Exit GALLUS
Wheres Dolabella
To second Proculeius
Dolabella
Let him alone for I remember now
How hes employd he shall in time be ready
Go with me to my tent where you shall see
How hardly I was drawn into this war
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
In all my writings go with me and see
What I can show in this
Exeunt
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN and IRAS
My desolation does begin to make
A better life Tis paltry to be Caesar
Not being Fortune hes but Fortunes knave
A minister of her will and it is great
To do that thing that ends all other deeds
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change
Which sleeps and never palates more the dug
The beggars nurse and Caesars
Enter to the gates of the monument PROCULEIUS GALLUS and Soldiers
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt
And bids thee study on what fair demands
Thou meanst to have him grant thee
Whats thy name
My name is Proculeius
Antony
Did tell me of you bade me trust you but
I do not greatly care to be deceived
That have no use for trusting If your master
Would have a queen his beggar you must tell him
That majesty to keep decorum must
No less beg than a kingdom if he please
To give me conquerd Egypt for my son
He gives me so much of mine own as I
Will kneel to him with thanks
Be of good cheer
Youre falln into a princely hand fear nothing
Make your full reference freely to my lord
Who is so full of grace that it flows over
On all that need let me report to him
Your sweet dependency and you shall find
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
Where he for grace is kneeld to
Pray you tell him
I am his fortunes vassal and I send him
The greatness he has got I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience and would gladly
Look him i the face
This Ill report dear lady
Have comfort for I know your plight is pitied
Of him that caused it
You see how easily she may be surprised
Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window and  having descended come behind CLEOPATRA Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates

Guard her till Caesar come
Exit
Royal queen
O Cleopatra thou art taken queen
Quick quick good hands
Drawing a dagger
Hold worthy lady hold
Seizes and disarms her
Do not yourself such wrong who are in this
Relieved but not betrayd
What of death too

Cleopatra
Do not abuse my masters bounty by
The undoing of yourself let the world see
Will never let come forth
Where art thou death
Come hither come come come and take a queen
Worthy many babes and beggars
O temperance lady
Sir I will eat no meat Ill not drink sir
If idle talk will once be necessary
Ill not sleep neither this mortal house Ill ruin
Do Caesar what he can Know sir that I
Will not wait piniond at your masters court
Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
Of dull Octavia Shall they hoist me up
And show me to the shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt
Be gentle grave unto me rather on Nilus mud
Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies
Blow me into abhorring rather make
My countrys high pyramides my gibbet
And hang me up in chains
You do extend
These thoughts of horror further than you shall
Find cause in Caesar
Enter DOLABELLA
Proculeius
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows
And he hath sent for thee for the queen
Ill take her to my guard
So Dolabella
It shall content me best be gentle to her
To CLEOPATRA
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please
If youll employ me to him
Say I would die
Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers
Most noble empress you have heard of me
I cannot tell
Assuredly you know me
No matter sir what I have heard or known
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
Ist not your trick
I understand not madam
I dreamd there was an Emperor Antony
O such another sleep that I might see
But such another man
If it might please ye
His face was as the heavens and therein stuck
A sun and moon which kept their course
and lighted
The little O the earth
Most sovereign creature
His legs bestrid the ocean his reard arm
Crested the world his voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres and that to friends
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb
He was as rattling thunder For his bounty
There was no winter int an autumn twas
That grew the more by reaping his delights
Were dolphinlike they showd his back above
The element they lived in in his livery
Walkd crowns and crownets realms and islands were
As plates droppd from his pocket
Cleopatra
Think you there was or might be such a man
As this I dreamd of
Gentle madam no
You lie up to the hearing of the gods
But if there be or ever were one such
Its past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine
And Antony were natures piece gainst fancy
Condemning shadows quite
Hear me good madam
Your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
As answering to the weight would I might never
Oertake pursued success but I do feel
By the rebound of yours a grief that smites
My very heart at root
I thank you sir
Know you what Caesar means to do with me
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew
Nay pray you sir
Though he be honourable
Hell lead me then in triumph
Madam he will I knowt
Flourish and shout within Make way there Octavius Caesar
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR GALLUS PROCULEIUS MECAENAS SELEUCUS and others of his Train

It is the emperor madam
CLEOPATRA kneels
Arise you shall not kneel
I pray you rise rise Egypt
Sir the gods
Will have it thus my master and my lord
I must obey
Take to you no hard thoughts
The record of what injuries you did us
Though written in our flesh we shall remember
As things but done by chance
Sole sir o the world
I cannot project mine own cause so well
To make it clear but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
Have often shamed our sex
Cleopatra know
We will extenuate rather than enforce
If you apply yourself to our intents
Which towards you are most gentle you shall find
A benefit in this change but if you seek
To lay on me a cruelty by taking
Antonys course you shall bereave yourself
Of my good purposes and put your children
To that destruction which Ill guard them from
If thereon you rely Ill take my leave
And may through all the world tis yours and we
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
Hang in what place you please Here my good lord
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra
This is the brief of money plate and jewels
Not petty things admitted Wheres Seleucus
Here madam
This is my treasurer let him speak my lord
Upon his peril that I have reserved
To myself nothing Speak the truth Seleucus
Madam
I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
Speak that which is not
What have I kept back
Enough to purchase what you have made known
Nay blush not Cleopatra I approve
Your wisdom in the deed
See Caesar O behold
How pomp is followd mine will now be yours
And should we shift estates yours would be mine
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild O slave of no more trust
Than love thats hired What goest thou back thou shalt
Go back I warrant thee but Ill catch thine eyes
Though they had wings slave soulless villain dog
O rarely base
Good queen let us entreat you
O Caesar what a wounding shame is this
That thou vouchsafing here to visit me
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy Say good Caesar
That I some lady trifles have reserved
Immoment toys things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal and say
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia to induce
Their mediation must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred The gods it smites me
Beneath the fall I have
To SELEUCUS
Prithee go hence
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man
Thou wouldst have mercy on me
Forbear Seleucus
Exit SELEUCUS
Be it known that we the greatest are misthought
For things that others do and when we fall
We answer others merits in our name
Are therefore to be pitied
Cleopatra
Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged
Put we i the roll of conquest still bet yours
Bestow it at your pleasure and believe
Caesars no merchant to make prize with you
Of things that merchants sold Therefore be cheerd
Make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel Feed and sleep
Our care and pity is so much upon you
That we remain your friend and so adieu
My master and my lord
Not so Adieu

Exit DOLABELLA
Now Iras what thinkst thou
Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown
In Rome as well as Imechanic slaves
With greasy aprons rules and hammers shall
Uplift us to the view in their thick breaths
Rank of gross diet shall be enclouded
And forced to drink their vapour
The gods forbid
Nay tis most certain Iras saucy lictors
Will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers
Ballad us out o tune the quick comedians
Extemporally will stage us and present
Our Alexandrian revels Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth and I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
I the posture of a whore
O the good gods
Nay thats certain
Ill never see t for I am sure my nails
Are stronger than mine eyes
Why thats the way
To fool their preparation and to conquer
Their most absurd intents

Avoid and leave him
Exit Guardsman
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
That kills and pains not
Truly I have him but I would not be the party
that should desire you to touch him for his biting
is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover
Rememberest thou any that have died ont
Very many men and women too I heard of one of
them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman
but something given to lie as a woman should not
do but in the way of honesty how she died of the
biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes
a very good report o the worm but he that will
believe all that they say shall never be saved by
half that they do but this is most fallible the
worms an odd worm
Get thee hence farewell
I wish you all joy of the worm
Setting down his basket
Farewell
You must think this look you that the worm will
do his kind
Ay ay farewell
Look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the
keeping of wise people for indeed there is no
goodness in worm
Take thou no care it shall be heeded
Very good Give it nothing I pray you for it is
not worth the feeding
Will it eat me
You must not think I am so simple but I know the
devil himself will not eat a woman I know that a
woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her
not But truly these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women for in every ten
that they make the devils mar five
Well get thee gone farewell
Yes forsooth I wish you joy o the worm

Yare yare good Iras quick Methinks I hear
Antony call I see him rouse himself
The luck of Caesar which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath husband I come
Now to that name my courage prove my title
I am fire and air my other elements
I give to baser life So have you done
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips
Farewell kind Charmian Iras long farewell
Kisses them IRAS falls and dies
Have I the aspic in my lips Dost fall
If thou and nature can so gently part
The stroke of death is as a lovers pinch
Which hurts and is desired Dost thou lie still
If thus thou vanishest thou tellst the world
It is not worth leavetaking
Dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say
The gods themselves do weep
This proves me base
If she first meet the curled Antony
Hell make demand of her and spend that kiss
Which is my heaven to have Come thou
mortal wretch
To an asp which she applies to her breast
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie poor venomous fool
Be angry and dispatch O couldst thou speak
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
Unpolicied
O eastern star
Peace peace
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
That sucks the nurse asleep
O break O break
As sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle
O AntonyNay I will take thee too
Applying another asp to her arm
What should I stay
Dies
In this vile world So fare thee well
Now boast thee death in thy possession lies
A lass unparalleld Downy windows close
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal Your crowns awry
Ill mend it and then play
Enter the Guard rushing in
Where is the queen
Speak softly wake her not
Caesar hath sent
Too slow a messenger
Applies an asp
O come apace dispatch I partly feel thee
Approach ho Alls not well Caesars beguiled
Theres Dolabella sent from Caesar call him
What work is here Charmian is this well done
It is well done and fitting for a princess
Descended of so many royal kings
Ah soldier
Dies
Reenter DOLABELLA
How goes it here
All dead
Caesar thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this thyself art coming
So soughtst to hinder
Within  A way there a way for Caesar
Reenter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching
O sir you are too sure an augurer
That you did fear is done
Bravest at the last
She levelld at our purposes and being royal
Took her own way The manner of their deaths
I do not see them bleed
Who was last with them
A simple countryman that brought her figs
This was his basket
Poisond then
O Caesar
This Charmian lived but now she stood and spake
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress tremblingly she stood
And on the sudden droppd
O noble weakness
If they had swallowd poison twould appear
By external swelling but she looks like sleep
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace
Here on her breast
There is a vent of blood and something blown
The like is on her arm
This is an aspics trail and these figleaves
Have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves
Upon the caves of Nile
Most probable
That so she died for her physician tells me
She hath pursued conclusions infinite
Of easy ways to die Take up her bed
And bear her women from the monument
She shall be buried by her Antony
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous High events as these
Strike those that make them and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented Our army shall
In solemn show attend this funeral
And then to Rome Come Dolabella see
High order in this great solemnity
Exeunt
Enter DUKE SOLINUS AEGEON Gaoler Officers and other Attendants
Proceed Solinus to procure my fall
And by the doom of death end woes and all
Merchant of Syracuse plead no more
I am not partial to infringe our laws
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants our welldealing countrymen
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
Have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks
For since the mortal and intestine jars
Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay more
If any born at Ephesus be seen
At any Syracusian marts and fairs
Again if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies
His goods confiscate to the dukes dispose
Unless a thousand marks be levied
To quit the penalty and to ransom him
Thy substance valued at the highest rate
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die
Yet this my comfort when your words are done
My woes end likewise with the evening sun
Well Syracusian say in brief the cause
Why thou departedst from thy native home
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus
A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable
Yet that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature not by vile offence
Ill utter what my sorrows give me leave
In Syracusa was I born and wed
Unto a woman happy but for me
And by me had not our hap been bad
With her I lived in joy our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was
There had she not been long but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons
And which was strange the one so like the other
As could not be distinguishd but by names
That very hour and in the selfsame inn
A meaner woman was delivered
Of such a burden male twins both alike
Thosefor their parents were exceeding poor
I bought and brought up to attend my sons
My wife not meanly proud of two such boys
Made daily motions for our home return
Unwilling I agreed Alas too soon
We came aboard
A league from Epidamnum had we saild
Before the always windobeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm
But longer did we not retain much hope
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death
Which though myself would gladly have embraced
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife
Weeping before for what she saw must come
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes
That mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear
Forced me to seek delays for them and me
And this it was for other means was none
The sailors sought for safety by our boat
And left the ship then sinkingripe to us
My wife more careful for the latterborn
Had fastend him unto a small spare mast
Such as seafaring men provide for storms
To him one of the other twins was bound
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other
The children thus disposed my wife and I
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd
Fastend ourselves at either end the mast
And floating straight obedient to the stream
Was carried towards Corinth as we thought
At length the sun gazing upon the earth
Dispersed those vapours that offended us
And by the benefit of his wished light
The seas waxd calm and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us
Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this
But ere they cameO let me say no more
Gather the sequel by that went before
Nay forward old man do not break off so
For we may pity though not pardon thee
O had the gods done so I had not now
Worthily termd them merciless to us
For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
We were encounterd by a mighty rock
Which being violently borne upon
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
So that in this unjust divorce of us
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in what to sorrow for
Her part poor soul seeming as burdened
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe
Was carried with more speed before the wind
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth as we thought
At length another ship had seized on us
And knowing whom it was their hap to save
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreckd guests
And would have reft the fishers of their prey
Had not their bark been very slow of sail
And therefore homeward did they bend their course
Thus have you heard me severd from my bliss
That by misfortunes was my life prolongd
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
Do me the favour to dilate at full
What hath befalln of them and thee till now
My youngest boy and yet my eldest care
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother and importuned me
That his attendantso his case was like
Reft of his brother but retaind his name
Might bear him company in the quest of him
Whom whilst I labourd of a love to see
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia
And coasting homeward came to Ephesus
Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbours men
But here must end the story of my life
And happy were I in my timely death
Could all my travels warrant me they live
Hapless AEgeon whom the fates have markd
To bear the extremity of dire mishap
Now trust me were it not against our laws
Against my crown my oath my dignity
Which princes would they may not disannul
My soul would sue as advocate for thee
But though thou art adjudged to the death
And passed sentence may not be recalld
But to our honours great disparagement
Yet I will favour thee in what I can
Therefore merchant Ill limit thee this day
To seek thy life by beneficial help
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus
Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
And live if no then thou art doomd to die
Gaoler take him to thy custody
I will my lord
Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend
But to procrastinate his lifeless end
Exeunt
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse DROMIO of Syracuse and First Merchant
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west
There is your money that I had to keep
ANTIPHOLUS
Go bear it to the Centaur where we host
And stay there Dromio till I come to thee
Within this hour it will be dinnertime
Till that Ill view the manners of the town
Peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings
And then return and sleep within mine inn
For with long travel I am stiff and weary
Get thee away
Many a man would take you at your word
And go indeed having so good a mean
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
A trusty villain sir that very oft
When I am dull with care and melancholy
Lightens my humour with his merry jests
What will you walk with me about the town
And then go to my inn and dine with me
I am invited sir to certain merchants
Of whom I hope to make much benefit
I crave your pardon Soon at five oclock
Please you Ill meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bedtime
My present business calls me from you now
ANTIPHOLUS
Farewell till then I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city
Sir I commend you to your own content
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop
Who falling there to find his fellow forth
Unseen inquisitive confounds himself
So I to find a mother and a brother
In quest of them unhappy lose myself
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
Here comes the almanac of my true date
What now how chance thou art returnd so soon
Returnd so soon rather approachd too late
The capon burns the pig falls from the spit
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell
My mistress made it one upon my cheek
She is so hot because the meat is cold
The meat is cold because you come not home
You come not home because you have no stomach
You have no stomach having broke your fast
But we that know what tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default today
ANTIPHOLUS
Stop in your wind sir tell me this I pray
Where have you left the money that I gave you
Osixpence that I had o Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress crupper
The saddler had it sir I kept it not
ANTIPHOLUS
I am not in a sportive humour now
Tell me and dally not where is the money
We being strangers here how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody
I pray you air as you sit at dinner
I from my mistress come to you in post
If I return I shall be post indeed
For she will score your fault upon my pate
Methinks your maw like mine should be your clock
And strike you home without a messenger
ANTIPHOLUS
Come Dromio come these jests are out of season
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee
To me sir why you gave no gold to me
ANTIPHOLUS
Come on sir knave have done your foolishness
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house the Phoenix sir to dinner
My mistress and her sister stays for you
ANTIPHOLUS
In what safe place you have bestowd my money
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me
I have some marks of yours upon my pate
Some of my mistress marks upon my shoulders
But not a thousand marks between you both
If I should pay your worship those again
Perchance you will not bear them patiently
ANTIPHOLUS
Thy mistress marks what mistress slave hast thou
Your worships wife my mistress at the Phoenix
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner
ANTIPHOLUS
What wilt thou flout me thus unto my face
Being forbid There take you that sir knave
What mean you sir for Gods sake hold your hands
Nay and you will not sir Ill take my heels
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
Upon my life by some device or other
The villain is oerraught of all my money
They say this town is full of cozenage
As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye
Darkworking sorcerers that change the mind
Soulkilling witches that deform the body
Disguised cheaters prating mountebanks
And many suchlike liberties of sin
If it prove so I will be gone the sooner
Ill to the Centaur to go seek this slave
I greatly fear my money is not safe
Exit
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
Neither my husband nor the slave returnd
That in such haste I sent to seek his master
Sure Luciana it is two oclock
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him
And from the mart hes somewhere gone to dinner
Good sister let us dine and never fret
A man is master of his liberty
Time is their master and when they see time
Theyll go or come if so be patient sister
Why should their liberty than ours be more
Because their business still lies out o door
Look when I serve him so he takes it ill
O know he is the bridle of your will
Theres none but asses will be bridled so
Why headstrong liberty is lashd with woe
Theres nothing situate under heavens eye
But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
The beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
Are their males subjects and at their controls
Men more divine the masters of all these
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas
Indued with intellectual sense and souls
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls
Are masters to their females and their lords
Then let your will attend on their accords
This servitude makes you to keep unwed
Not this but troubles of the marriagebed
But were you wedded you would bear some sway
How if your husband start some other where
Till he come home again I would forbear
Patience unmoved no marvel though she pause
They can be meek that have no other cause
A wretched soul bruised with adversity
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry
But were we burdened with like weight of pain
As much or more would we ourselves complain
So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me
But if thou live to see like right bereft
This foolbeggd patience in thee will be left
Well I will marry one day but to try
Here comes your man now is your husband nigh
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
Say is your tardy master now at hand
Nay hes at two hands with me and that my two ears
can witness
Say didst thou speak with him knowst thou his mind
Ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
Beshrew his hand I scarce could understand it
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning
Nay he struck so plainly I could too well feel his
blows and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
understand them
But say I prithee is he coming home It seems he
hath great care to please his wife
Why mistress sure my master is hornmad
Hornmad thou villain
I mean not cuckoldmad
But sure he is stark mad
When I desired him to come home to dinner
He askd me for a thousand marks in gold
Tis dinnertime quoth I My gold quoth he
Your meat doth burn quoth I My gold quoth he
Will you come home quoth I My gold quoth he
Where is the thousand marks I gave thee villain
The pig quoth I is burnd My gold quoth he
My mistress sir quoth I Hang up thy mistress
I know not thy mistress out on thy mistress
Quoth who
Quoth my master
I know quoth he no house no wife no mistress
So that my errand due unto my tongue
I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders
For in conclusion he did beat me there
Go back again thou slave and fetch him home
Go back again and be new beaten home
For Gods sake send some other messenger
Back slave or I will break thy pate across
And he will bless that cross with other beating
Between you I shall have a holy head
Hence prating peasant fetch thy master home
Am I so round with you as you with me
That like a football you do spurn me thus
You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
If I last in this service you must case me in leather
Exit
Fie how impatience loureth in your face
His company must do his minions grace
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
Are my discourses dull barren my wit
If voluble and sharp discourse be marrd
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
Do their gay vestments his affections bait
Thats not my fault hes master of my state
What ruins are in me that can be found
By him not ruind then is he the ground
Of my defeatures My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But too unruly deer he breaks the pale
And feeds from home poor I am but his stale
Selfharming jealousy fie beat it hence
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere
Or else what lets it but he would be here
Sister you know he promised me a chain
Would that alone alone he would detain
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
That others touch and often touching will
Wear gold and no man that hath a name
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye
Ill weep whats left away and weeping die
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy
Exeunt
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave
Is wanderd forth in care to seek me out
By computation and mine hosts report
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart See here he comes
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
How now sir is your merry humour alterd
As you love strokes so jest with me again
You know no Centaur you received no gold
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
My house was at the Phoenix Wast thou mad
That thus so madly thou didst answer me
What answer sir when spake I such a word
ANTIPHOLUS
Even now even here not half an hour since
I did not see you since you sent me hence
Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me
ANTIPHOLUS
Villain thou didst deny the golds receipt
And toldst me of a mistress and a dinner
For which I hope thou feltst I was displeased
I am glad to see you in this merry vein
What means this jest I pray you master tell me
ANTIPHOLUS
Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
Thinkst thou I jest Hold take thou that and that
Beating him
Hold sir for Gods sake now your jest is earnest
Upon what bargain do you give it me
ANTIPHOLUS
Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
And make a common of my serious hours
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams
If you will jest with me know my aspect
And fashion your demeanor to my looks
Or I will beat this method in your sconce
Sconce call you it so you would leave battering I
had rather have it a head an you use these blows
long I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders
But I pray sir why am I beaten
ANTIPHOLUS
Dost thou not know
Nothing sir but that I am beaten
ANTIPHOLUS
Shall I tell you why
Ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath
a wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS
Why firstfor flouting me and then wherefore
For urging it the second time to me
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason
Well sir I thank you
ANTIPHOLUS
Thank me sir for what
Marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing
ANTIPHOLUS
Ill make you amends next to give you nothing for
something But say sir is it dinnertime
No sir I think the meat wants that I have
ANTIPHOLUS
In good time sir whats that
Basting
ANTIPHOLUS
Well sir then twill be dry
If it be sir I pray you eat none of it
ANTIPHOLUS
Your reason
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting
ANTIPHOLUS
Well sir learn to jest in good time theres a
time for all things
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric
ANTIPHOLUS
By what rule sir
Marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father Time himself
ANTIPHOLUS
Lets hear it
Theres no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature
ANTIPHOLUS
May he not do it by fine and recovery
Yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man
ANTIPHOLUS
Why is Time such a niggard of hair being as it is
so plentiful an excrement
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit
ANTIPHOLUS
Why but theres many a man hath more hair than wit
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair
ANTIPHOLUS
Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit
The plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity
ANTIPHOLUS
For what reason
For two and sound ones too
ANTIPHOLUS
Nay not sound I pray you
Sure ones then
ANTIPHOLUS
Nay not sure in a thing falsing
Certain ones then
ANTIPHOLUS
Name them
The one to save the money that he spends in
trimming the other that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge
ANTIPHOLUS
You would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things
Marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair
lost by nature
ANTIPHOLUS
But your reason was not substantial why there is no
time to recover
Thus I mend it Time himself is bald and therefore
to the worlds end will have bald followers
ANTIPHOLUS
I knew twould be a bald conclusion
But soft who wafts us yonder
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
Ay ay Antipholus look strange and frown
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
I am not Adriana nor thy wife
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear
That never object pleasing in thine eye
That never touch well welcome to thy hand
That never meat sweetsavord in thy taste
Unless I spake or lookd or touchd or carved to thee
How comes it now my husband O how comes it
That thou art thus estranged from thyself
Thyself I call it being strange to me
That undividable incorporate
Am better than thy dear selfs better part
Ah do not tear away thyself from me
For know my love as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf
And take unmingled that same drop again
Without addition or diminishing
As take from me thyself and not me too
How dearly would it touch me to the quick
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body consecrate to thee
By ruffian lust should be contaminate
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the staind skin off my harlotbrow
And from my false hand cut the weddingring
And break it with a deepdivorcing vow
I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
I am possessd with an adulterate blot
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust
For if we too be one and thou play false
I do digest the poison of thy flesh
Being strumpeted by thy contagion
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed
I live unstaind thou undishonoured
ANTIPHOLUS
Plead you to me fair dame I know you not
In Ephesus I am but two hours old
As strange unto your town as to your talk
Who every word by all my wit being scannd
Want wit in all one word to understand
Fie brother how the world is changed with you
When were you wont to use my sister thus
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner
ANTIPHOLUS
By Dromio
By me
By thee and this thou didst return from him
That he did buffet thee and in his blows
Denied my house for his me for his wife
ANTIPHOLUS
Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
I sir I never saw her till this time
ANTIPHOLUS
Villain thou liest for even her very words
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart
I never spake with her in all my life
ANTIPHOLUS
How can she thus then call us by our names
Unless it be by inspiration
How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
Come I will fasten on this sleeve of thine
Thou art an elm my husband I a vine
Whose weakness married to thy stronger state
Makes me with thy strength to communicate
If aught possess thee from me it is dross
Usurping ivy brier or idle moss
Who all for want of pruning with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
ANTIPHOLUS
To me she speaks she moves me for her theme
What was I married to her in my dream
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss
Until I know this sure uncertainty
Ill entertain the offerd fallacy
Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
O for my beads I cross me for a sinner
This is the fairy land O spite of spites
We talk with goblins owls and sprites
If we obey them not this will ensue
Theyll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue
Why pratest thou to thyself and answerst not
Dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot
I am transformed master am I not
ANTIPHOLUS
I think thou art in mind and so am I
Nay master both in mind and in my shape
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou hast thine own form
No I am an ape
If thou art changed to aught tis to an ass
Tis true she rides me and I long for grass
Tis so I am an ass else it could never be
But I should know her as well as she knows me
Come come no longer will I be a fool
To put the finger in the eye and weep
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn
Come sir to dinner Dromio keep the gate
Husband Ill dine above with you today
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
Sirrah if any ask you for your master
Say he dines forth and let no creature enter
Come sister Dromio play the porter well
ANTIPHOLUS
Am I in earth in heaven or in hell
Sleeping or waking mad or welladvised
Known unto these and to myself disguised
Ill say as they say and persever so
And in this mist at all adventures go
Master shall I be porter at the gate
Ay and let none enter lest I break your pate
Come come Antipholus we dine too late
Exeunt

ANTIPHOLUS
Good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours
Say that I lingerd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet
And that tomorrow you will bring it home
But heres a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart and that I beat him
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold
And that I did deny my wife and house
Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this
Say what you will sir but I know what I know
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show
If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think
ANTIPHOLUS
I think thou art an ass
Marry so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear
I should kick being kickd and being at that pass
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass
ANTIPHOLUS
Youre sad Signior Balthazar pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcome here
I hold your dainties cheap sir and your
welcome dear
ANTIPHOLUS
O Signior Balthazar either at flesh or fish
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish
Good meat sir is common that every churl affords
ANTIPHOLUS
And welcome more common for thats nothing but words
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast
ANTIPHOLUS
Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest
But though my cates be mean take them in good part
Better cheer may you have but not with better heart
But soft my door is lockd Go bid them let us in

The one neer got me credit the other mickle blame
If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
name for an ass
Within  What a coil is there Dromio who are those
at the gate
Let my master in Luce
Within  Faith no he comes too late
And so tell your master
O Lord I must laugh
Have at you with a proverbShall I set in my staff
Within  Have at you with another thatsWhen
can you tell
Within  If thy name be calld LuceLuce thou hast
answered him well
Do you hear you minion youll let us in I hope
OF EPHESUS
Within  I thought to have asked you
Within  And you said no
So come help well struck there was blow for blow
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou baggage let me in
Within  Can you tell for whose sake
Master knock the door hard
Within  Let him knock till it ache
ANTIPHOLUS
Youll cry for this minion if I beat the door down
Within  What needs all that and a pair of stocks in the town
Within  Who is that at the door that keeps all
this noise
Within  By my troth your town is troubled with
unruly boys
ANTIPHOLUS
Are you there wife you might have come before
Within  Your wife sir knave go get you from the door
If you went in pain master this knave would go sore
Here is neither cheer sir nor welcome we would
fain have either
In debating which was best we shall part with neither
They stand at the door master bid them welcome hither
ANTIPHOLUS
There is something in the wind that we cannot get in
You would say so master if your garments were thin
Your cake there is warm within you stand here in the cold
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold
ANTIPHOLUS
Go fetch me something Ill break ope the gate
Within  Break any breaking here and Ill break your
knaves pate
A man may break a word with you sir and words are but wind
Ay and break it in your face so he break it not behind
Within  It seems thou wantst breaking out upon
thee hind
Heres too much out upon thee I pray thee
let me in
Within  Ay when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin
ANTIPHOLUS
Well Ill break in go borrow me a crow
A crow without feather Master mean you so
For a fish without a fin theres a fowl without a feather
If a crow help us in sirrah well pluck a crow together
ANTIPHOLUS
Go get thee gone fetch me an iron crow
Have patience sir O let it not be so
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honour of your wife
Once thisyour long experience of her wisdom
Her sober virtue years and modesty
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown
And doubt not sir but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you
Be ruled by me depart in patience
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day
A vulgar comment will be made of it
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead
For slander lives upon succession
For ever housed where it gets possession
ANTIPHOLUS
You have prevailed I will depart in quiet
And in despite of mirth mean to be merry
I know a wench of excellent discourse
Pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle
There will we dine This woman that I mean
My wifebut I protest without desert
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal
To her will we to dinner
To Angelo
Get you home
And fetch the chain by this I know tis made
Bring it I pray you to the Porpentine
For theres the house that chain will I bestow
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife
Upon mine hostess there good sir make haste
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me
Ill knock elsewhere to see if theyll disdain me
Ill meet you at that place some hour hence
ANTIPHOLUS
Do so This jest shall cost me some expense
Exeunt
Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husbands office shall Antipholus
Even in the spring of love thy lovesprings rot
Shall love in building grow so ruinous
If you did wed my sister for her wealth
Then for her wealths sake use her with more kindness
Or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness
Let not my sister read it in your eye
Be not thy tongue thy own shames orator
Look sweet be fair become disloyalty
Apparel vice like virtues harbinger
Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
Be secretfalse what need she be acquainted
What simple thief brags of his own attaint
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board
Shame hath a bastard fame well managed
Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word
Alas poor women make us but believe
Though others have the arm show us the sleeve
We in your motion turn and you may move us
Then gentle brother get you in again
Comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
Tis holy sport to be a little vain
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
ANTIPHOLUS
Sweet mistresswhat your name is else I know not
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Than our earths wonder more than earth divine
Teach me dear creature how to think and speak
Lay open to my earthygross conceit
Smotherd in errors feeble shallow weak
The folded meaning of your words deceit
Against my souls pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an unknown field
Are you a god would you create me new
Transform me then and to your power Ill yield
But if that I am I then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
Far more far more to you do I decline
O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
To drown me in thy sisters flood of tears
Sing siren for thyself and I will dote
Spread oer the silver waves thy golden hairs
And as a bed Ill take them and there lie
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die
Let Love being light be drowned if she sink
What are you mad that you do reason so
ANTIPHOLUS
Not mad but mated how I do not know
It is a fault that springeth from your eye
ANTIPHOLUS
For gazing on your beams fair sun being by
Gaze where you should and that will clear your sight
ANTIPHOLUS
As good to wink sweet love as look on night
Why call you me love call my sister so
ANTIPHOLUS
Thy sisters sister
Thats my sister
ANTIPHOLUS
No
It is thyself mine own selfs better part
Mine eyes clear eye my dear hearts dearer heart
My food my fortune and my sweet hopes aim
My sole earths heaven and my heavens claim
All this my sister is or else should be
ANTIPHOLUS
Call thyself sister sweet for I am thee
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife
Give me thy hand
O soft air hold you still
Ill fetch my sister to get her good will
Exit
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
Why how now Dromio where runnst thou so fast
Do you know me sir am I Dromio am I your man
am I myself
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou art Dromio thou art my man thou art thyself
I am an ass I am a womans man and besides myself
What womans man and how besides thyself besides thyself
Marry sir besides myself I am due to a woman one
that claims me one that haunts me one that will have me
ANTIPHOLUS
What claim lays she to thee
Marry sir such claim as you would lay to your
horse and she would have me as a beast not that I
being a beast she would have me but that she
being a very beastly creature lays claim to me
ANTIPHOLUS
What is she
A very reverent body ay such a one as a man may
not speak of without he say Sirreverence I have
but lean luck in the match and yet is she a
wondrous fat marriage
ANTIPHOLUS
How dost thou mean a fat marriage
Marry sir shes the kitchen wench and all grease
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
lamp of her and run from her by her own light I
warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
Poland winter if she lives till doomsday
shell burn a week longer than the whole world
ANTIPHOLUS
What complexion is she of
Swart like my shoe but her face nothing half so
clean kept for why she sweats a man may go over
shoes in the grime of it
ANTIPHOLUS
Thats a fault that water will mend
No sir tis in grain Noahs flood could not do it
ANTIPHOLUS
Whats her name
Nell sir but her name and three quarters thats
an ell and three quarters will not measure her from
hip to hip
ANTIPHOLUS
Then she bears some breadth
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip
she is spherical like a globe I could find out
countries in her
ANTIPHOLUS
In what part of her body stands Ireland
Marry in her buttocks I found it out by the bogs
ANTIPHOLUS
Where Scotland
I found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand
ANTIPHOLUS
Where France
In her forehead armed and reverted making war
against her heir
ANTIPHOLUS
Where England
I looked for the chalky cliffs but I could find no
whiteness in them but I guess it stood in her chin
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it
ANTIPHOLUS
Where Spain
Faith I saw it not but I felt it hot in her breath
ANTIPHOLUS
Where America the Indies
Oh sir upon her nose all oer embellished with
rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich
aspect to the hot breath of Spain who sent whole
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose
ANTIPHOLUS
Where stood Belgia the Netherlands
Oh sir I did not look so low To conclude this
drudge or diviner laid claim to me calld me
Dromio swore I was assured to her told me what
privy marks I had about me as the mark of my
shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my
left arm that I amazed ran from her as a witch
And I think if my breast had not been made of
faith and my heart of steel
She had transformd me to a curtal dog and made
me turn i the wheel
ANTIPHOLUS
Go hie thee presently post to the road
An if the wind blow any way from shore
I will not harbour in this town tonight
If any bark put forth come to the mart
Where I will walk till thou return to me
If every one knows us and we know none
Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone
As from a bear a man would run for life
So fly I from her that would be my wife
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
Theres none but witches do inhabit here
And therefore tis high time that I were hence
She that doth call me husband even my soul
Doth for a wife abhor But her fair sister
Possessd with such a gentle sovereign grace
Of such enchanting presence and discourse
Hath almost made me traitor to myself
But lest myself be guilty to selfwrong
Ill stop mine ears against the mermaids song
Enter ANGELO with the chain
Master Antipholus
ANTIPHOLUS
Ay thats my name
I know it well sir lo here is the chain
I thought to have taen you at the Porpentine
The chain unfinishd made me stay thus long
ANTIPHOLUS
What is your will that I shall do with this
What please yourself sir I have made it for you
ANTIPHOLUS
Made it for me sir I bespoke it not
Not once nor twice but twenty times you have
Go home with it and please your wife withal
And soon at suppertime Ill visit you
And then receive my money for the chain
ANTIPHOLUS
I pray you sir receive the money now
For fear you neer see chain nor money more
You are a merry man sir fare you well
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
What I should think of this I cannot tell
But this I think theres no man is so vain
That would refuse so fair an offerd chain
I see a man here needs not live by shifts
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts
Ill to the mart and there for Dromio stay
If any ship put out then straight away
Exit
Enter Second Merchant ANGELO and an Officer
You know since Pentecost the sum is due
And since I have not much importuned you
Nor now I had not but that I am bound
To Persia and want guilders for my voyage
Or Ill attach you by this officer
Even just the sum that I do owe to you
Is growing to me by Antipholus
And in the instant that I met with you
He had of me a chain at five oclock
I shall receive the money for the same
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house
I will discharge my bond and thank you too
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezans
That labour may you save see where he comes
ANTIPHOLUS
While I go to the goldsmiths house go thou
And buy a ropes end that will I bestow
Among my wife and her confederates
For locking me out of my doors by day
But soft I see the goldsmith Get thee gone
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me
I buy a thousand pound a year I buy a rope
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
A man is well holp up that trusts to you
I promised your presence and the chain
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me
Belike you thought our love would last too long
If it were chaind together and therefore came not
Saving your merry humour heres the note
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
Than I stand debted to this gentleman
I pray you see him presently discharged
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it
ANTIPHOLUS
I am not furnishd with the present money
Besides I have some business in the town
Good signior take the stranger to my house
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof
Perchance I will be there as soon as you
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself
ANTIPHOLUS
No bear it with you lest I come not time enough
Well sir I will Have you the chain about you
ANTIPHOLUS
An if I have not sir I hope you have
Or else you may return without your money
Nay come I pray you sir give me the chain
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman
And I to blame have held him here too long
ANTIPHOLUS
Good Lord you use this dalliance to excuse
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine
I should have chid you for not bringing it
But like a shrew you first begin to brawl
The hour steals on I pray you sir dispatch
You hear how he importunes methe chain
ANTIPHOLUS
Why give it to my wife and fetch your money
Come come you know I gave it you even now
Either send the chain or send me by some token
ANTIPHOLUS
Fie now you run this humour out of breath

My business cannot brook this dalliance
Good sir say whether youll answer me or no
If not Ill leave him to the officer
ANTIPHOLUS
I answer you what should I answer you
The money that you owe me for the chain
ANTIPHOLUS
I owe you none till I receive the chain
You know I gave it you half an hour since
ANTIPHOLUS
You gave me none you wrong me much to say so
You wrong me more sir in denying it
Consider how it stands upon my credit
Well officer arrest him at my suit
I do and charge you in the dukes name to obey me
This touches me in reputation
Either consent to pay this sum for me
Or I attach you by this officer
ANTIPHOLUS
Consent to pay thee that I never had
Arrest me foolish fellow if thou darest
Here is thy fee arrest him officer
I would not spare my brother in this case
If he should scorn me so apparently
I do arrest you sir you hear the suit
ANTIPHOLUS
I do obey thee till I give thee bail
But sirrah you shall buy this sport as dear
As all the metal in your shop will answer
Sir sir I will have law in Ephesus
To your notorious shame I doubt it not
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse from the bay
Master there is a bark of Epidamnum
That stays but till her owner comes aboard
And then sir she bears away Our fraughtage sir
I have conveyd aboard and I have bought
The oil the balsamum and aquavitae
The ship is in her trim the merry wind
Blows fair from land they stay for nought at all
But for their owner master and yourself
ANTIPHOLUS
How now a madman Why thou peevish sheep
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me
A ship you sent me to to hire waftage
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou drunken slave I sent thee for a rope
And told thee to what purpose and what end
You sent me for a ropes end as soon
You sent me to the bay sir for a bark
ANTIPHOLUS
I will debate this matter at more leisure
And teach your ears to list me with more heed
To Adriana villain hie thee straight
Give her this key and tell her in the desk
Thats coverd oer with Turkish tapestry
There is a purse of ducats let her send it
Tell her I am arrested in the street
And that shall bail me hie thee slave be gone
On officer to prison till it come
Exeunt Second Merchant Angelo Officer and Antipholus of Ephesus
To Adriana that is where we dined
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband
She is too big I hope for me to compass
Thither I must although against my will
For servants must their masters minds fulfil
Exit
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
Ah Luciana did he tempt thee so
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest yea or no
Lookd he or red or pale or sad or merrily
What observation madest thou in this case
Of his hearts meteors tilting in his face
First he denied you had in him no right
He meant he did me none the more my spite
Then swore he that he was a stranger here
And true he swore though yet forsworn he were
Then pleaded I for you
And what said he
That love I beggd for you he beggd of me
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love
With words that in an honest suit might move
First he did praise my beauty then my speech
Didst speak him fair
Have patience I beseech
I cannot nor I will not hold me still
My tongue though not my heart shall have his will
He is deformed crooked old and sere
Illfaced worse bodied shapeless everywhere
Vicious ungentle foolish blunt unkind
Stigmatical in making worse in mind
Who would be jealous then of such a one
No evil lost is waild when it is gone
Ah but I think him better than I say
And yet would herein others eyes were worse
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away
My heart prays for him though my tongue do curse
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
Here go the desk the purse sweet now make haste
How hast thou lost thy breath
By running fast
Where is thy master Dromio is he well
No hes in Tartar limbo worse than hell
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him
One whose hard heart is buttond up with steel
A fiend a fury pitiless and rough
A wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff
A backfriend a shoulderclapper one that
countermands
The passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell
Why man what is the matter
I do not know the matter he is rested on the case
What is he arrested Tell me at whose suit
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well
But hes in a suit of buff which rested him that can I tell
Will you send him mistress redemption the money in his desk
Go fetch it sister
Exit Luciana
This I wonder at
That he unknown to me should be in debt
Tell me was he arrested on a band
Not on a band but on a stronger thing
A chain a chain Do you not hear it ring
What the chain
No no the bell tis time that I were gone
It was two ere I left him and now the clock
strikes one
The hours come back that did I never hear
O yes if any hour meet a sergeant a turns back for
very fear
As if Time were in debt how fondly dost thou reason
Time is a very bankrupt and owes more than hes
worth to season
Nay hes a thief too have you not heard men say
That Time comes stealing on by night and day
If Time be in debt and theft and a sergeant in the way
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day
Reenter LUCIANA with a purse
Go Dromio theres the money bear it straight
And bring thy master home immediately
Come sister I am pressd down with conceit
Conceit my comfort and my injury
Exeunt
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
Theres not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their wellacquainted friend
And every one doth call me by my name
Some tender money to me some invite me
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses
Some offer me commodities to buy
Even now a tailor calld me in his shop
And showd me silks that he had bought for me
And therewithal took measure of my body
Sure these are but imaginary wiles
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master heres the gold you sent me for What have
you got the picture of old Adam newapparelled
ANTIPHOLUS
What gold is this what Adam dost thou mean
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
that keeps the prison he that goes in the calfs
skin that was killed for the Prodigal he that came
behind you sir like an evil angel and bid you
forsake your liberty
ANTIPHOLUS
I understand thee not
No why tis a plain case he that went like a
bassviol in a case of leather the man sir
that when gentlemen are tired gives them a sob
and rests them he sir that takes pity on decayed
men and gives them suits of durance he that sets up
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
morrispike
ANTIPHOLUS
What thou meanest an officer
Ay sir the sergeant of the band he that brings
any man to answer it that breaks his band one that
thinks a man always going to bed and says God
give you good rest
ANTIPHOLUS
Well sir there rest in your foolery Is there any
Why sir I brought you word an hour since that the
bark Expedition put forth tonight and then were
you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy
Delay Here are the angels that you sent for to
deliver you
ANTIPHOLUS
And here we wander in illusions
Some blessed power deliver us from hence
Enter a Courtezan
Well met well met Master Antipholus
I see sir you have found the goldsmith now
Is that the chain you promised me today
ANTIPHOLUS
Satan avoid I charge thee tempt me not
Master is this Mistress Satan
ANTIPHOLUS
It is the devil
Nay she is worse she is the devils dam and here
she comes in the habit of a light wench and thereof
comes that the wenches say God damn me thats as
much to say God make me a light wench It is
written they appear to men like angels of light
light is an effect of fire and fire will burn
ergo light wenches will burn Come not near her
Your man and you are marvellous merry sir
Will you go with me Well mend our dinner here
Master if you do expect spoonmeat or bespeak a
long spoon
ANTIPHOLUS
Why Dromio
Marry he must have a long spoon that must eat with
the devil
ANTIPHOLUS
Avoid then fiend what tellst thou me of supping
Thou art as you are all a sorceress
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner
Or for my diamond the chain you promised
And Ill be gone sir and not trouble you
Some devils ask but the parings of ones nail
A rush a hair a drop of blood a pin
A nut a cherrystone
But she more covetous would have a chain
Master be wise an if you give it her
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it
I pray you sir my ring or else the chain
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so
ANTIPHOLUS
Avaunt thou witch Come Dromio let us go
Fly pride says the peacock mistress that you know
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad
Else would he never so demean himself
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
And for the same he promised me a chain
Both one and other he denies me now
The reason that I gather he is mad
Besides this present instance of his rage
Is a mad tale he told today at dinner
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance
Belike his wife acquainted with his fits
On purpose shut the doors against his way
My way is now to hie home to his house
And tell his wife that being lunatic
He rushd into my house and took perforce
My ring away This course I fittest choose
For forty ducats is too much to lose
Exit
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer
ANTIPHOLUS
Fear me not man I will not break away
Ill give thee ere I leave thee so much money
To warrant thee as I am rested for
My wife is in a wayward mood today
And will not lightly trust the messenger
That I should be attachd in Ephesus
I tell you twill sound harshly in her ears
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a ropesend
Here comes my man I think he brings the money
How now sir have you that I sent you for
Heres that I warrant you will pay them all
ANTIPHOLUS
But wheres the money
Why sir I gave the money for the rope
ANTIPHOLUS
Five hundred ducats villain for a rope
Ill serve you sir five hundred at the rate
ANTIPHOLUS
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home
To a ropesend sir and to that end am I returned
ANTIPHOLUS
And to that end sir I will welcome you
Beating him
Good sir be patient
Nay tis for me to be patient I am in adversity
Good now hold thy tongue
Nay rather persuade him to hold his hands
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou whoreson senseless villain
I would I were senseless sir that I might not feel
your blows
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an
ass
I am an ass indeed you may prove it by my long
ears I have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant and have nothing at his
hands for my service but blows When I am cold he
heats me with beating when I am warm he cools me
with beating I am waked with it when I sleep
raised with it when I sit driven out of doors with
it when I go from home welcomed home with it when
I return nay I bear it on my shoulders as a
beggar wont her brat and I think when he hath
lamed me I shall beg with it from door to door
ANTIPHOLUS
Come go along my wife is coming yonder
Enter ADRIANA LUCIANA the Courtezan and PINCH
Mistress respice finem respect your end or
rather the prophecy like the parrot beware the
ropesend
ANTIPHOLUS
Wilt thou still talk
Beating him
How say you now is not your husband mad
His incivility confirms no less
Good Doctor Pinch you are a conjurer
Establish him in his true sense again
And I will please you what you will demand
Alas how fiery and how sharp he looks
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse
ANTIPHOLUS
There is my hand and let it feel your ear
Striking him
I charge thee Satan housed within this man
To yield possession to my holy prayers
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven
ANTIPHOLUS
Peace doting wizard peace I am not mad
O that thou wert not poor distressed soul
ANTIPHOLUS
You minion you are these your customers
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house today
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
And I denied to enter in my house
O husband God doth know you dined at home
Where would you had remaind until this time
Free from these slanders and this open shame
ANTIPHOLUS
Dined at home Thou villain what sayest thou
Sir sooth to say you did not dine at home
ANTIPHOLUS
Were not my doors lockd up and I shut out
Perdie your doors were lockd and you shut out
ANTIPHOLUS
And did not she herself revile me there
Sans fable she herself reviled you there
ANTIPHOLUS
Did not her kitchenmaid rail taunt and scorn me
Certes she did the kitchenvestal scornd you
ANTIPHOLUS
And did not I in rage depart from thence
In verity you did my bones bear witness
That since have felt the vigour of his rage
Ist good to soothe him in these contraries
It is no shame the fellow finds his vein
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou hast subornd the goldsmith to arrest me
Alas I sent you money to redeem you
By Dromio here who came in haste for it
Money by me heart and goodwill you might
But surely master not a rag of money
ANTIPHOLUS
Wentst not thou to her for a purse of ducats
He came to me and I deliverd it
And I am witness with her that she did
God and the ropemaker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope
Mistress both man and master is possessd
I know it by their pale and deadly looks
They must be bound and laid in some dark room
ANTIPHOLUS
Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold
I did not gentle husband lock thee forth
And gentle master I received no gold
But I confess sir that we were lockd out
Dissembling villain thou speakst false in both
ANTIPHOLUS
Dissembling harlot thou art false in all
And art confederate with a damned pack
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me
But with these nails Ill pluck out these false eyes
That would behold in me this shameful sport
Enter three or four and offer to bind him He strives
O bind him bind him let him not come near me
More company The fiend is strong within him
Ay me poor man how pale and wan he looks
ANTIPHOLUS
What will you murder me Thou gaoler thou
I am thy prisoner wilt thou suffer them
To make a rescue
Masters let him go
He is my prisoner and you shall not have him
Go bind this man for he is frantic too
They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus
What wilt thou do thou peevish officer
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself
He is my prisoner if I let him go
The debt he owes will be required of me
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor
And knowing how the debt grows I will pay it
Good master doctor see him safe conveyd
Home to my house O most unhappy day
ANTIPHOLUS
O most unhappy strumpet
Master I am here entered in bond for you
ANTIPHOLUS
Out on thee villain wherefore dost thou mad me
Will you be bound for nothing be mad good master
cry The devil
God help poor souls how idly do they talk
Go bear him hence Sister go you with me
Exeunt all but Adriana Luciana Officer and Courtezan
Say now whose suit is he arrested at
One Angelo a goldsmith do you know him
I know the man What is the sum he owes
Two hundred ducats
Say how grows it due
Due for a chain your husband had of him
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not
When as your husband all in rage today
Came to my house and took away my ring
The ring I saw upon his finger now
Straight after did I meet him with a chain
It may be so but I did never see it
Come gaoler bring me where the goldsmith is
I long to know the truth hereof at large
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn and DROMIO of Syracuse
God for thy mercy they are loose again
And come with naked swords
Lets call more help to have them bound again
Away theyll kill us
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
I see these witches are afraid of swords
She that would be your wife now ran from you
ANTIPHOLUS
Come to the Centaur fetch our stuff from thence
I long that we were safe and sound aboard
Faith stay here this night they will surely do us
no harm you saw they speak us fair give us gold
methinks they are such a gentle nation that but for
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me I could find in my heart to stay here still and
turn witch
ANTIPHOLUS
I will not stay tonight for all the town
Therefore away to get our stuff aboard
Exeunt
Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO
I am sorry sir that I have hinderd you
But I protest he had the chain of me
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it
How is the man esteemed here in the city
Of very reverend reputation sir
Of credit infinite highly beloved
Second to none that lives here in the city
His word might bear my wealth at any time
Speak softly yonder as I think he walks
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
Tis so and that self chain about his neck
Which he forswore most monstrously to have
Good sir draw near to me Ill speak to him
Signior Antipholus I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble
And not without some scandal to yourself
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain which now you wear so openly
Beside the charge the shame imprisonment
You have done wrong to this my honest friend
Who but for staying on our controversy
Had hoisted sail and put to sea today
This chain you had of me can you deny it
ANTIPHOLUS
I think I had I never did deny it
Yes that you did sir and forswore it too
ANTIPHOLUS
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it
These ears of mine thou knowst did hear thee
Fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou livest
To walk where any honest man resort
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus
Ill prove mine honour and mine honesty
Against thee presently if thou darest stand
I dare and do defy thee for a villain
They draw
Enter ADRIANA LUCIANA the Courtezan and others
Hold hurt him not for Gods sake he is mad
Some get within him take his sword away
Bind Dromio too and bear them to my house
Run master run for Gods sake take a house
This is some priory In or we are spoild
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory
Enter the Lady Abbess AEMILIA
Be quiet people Wherefore throng you hither
Let us come in that we may bind him fast
And bear him home for his recovery
I knew he was not in his perfect wits
I am sorry now that I did draw on him
How long hath this possession held the man
This week he hath been heavy sour sad
And much different from the man he was
But till this afternoon his passion
Neer brake into extremity of rage
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
Buried some dear friend Hath not else his eye
Strayd his affection in unlawful love
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
Which of these sorrows is he subject to
To none of these except it be the last
Namely some love that drew him oft from home
You should for that have reprehended him
Why so I did
Ay but not rough enough
As roughly as my modesty would let me
Haply in private
And in assemblies too
Ay but not enough
It was the copy of our conference
In bed he slept not for my urging it
At board he fed not for my urging it
Alone it was the subject of my theme
In company I often glanced it
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad
And thereof came it that the man was mad
The venom clamours of a jealous woman
Poisons more deadly than a mad dogs tooth
It seems his sleeps were hinderd by thy railing
And therefore comes it that his head is light
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
Unquiet meals make ill digestions
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred
And whats a fever but a fit of madness
Thou sayst his sports were hinderd by thy brawls
Sweet recreation barrd what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life
In food in sport and lifepreserving rest
To be disturbd would mad or man or beast
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits
She never reprehended him but mildly
When he demeand himself rough rude and wildly
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not
She did betray me to my own reproof
Good people enter and lay hold on him
No not a creature enters in my house
Then let your servants bring my husband forth
Neither he took this place for sanctuary
And it shall privilege him from your hands
Till I have brought him to his wits again
Or lose my labour in assaying it
I will attend my husband be his nurse
Diet his sickness for it is my office
And will have no attorney but myself
And therefore let me have him home with me
Be patient for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have
With wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
To make of him a formal man again
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath
A charitable duty of my order
Therefore depart and leave him here with me
I will not hence and leave my husband here
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife
Be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
Exit
Complain unto the duke of this indignity
Come go I will fall prostrate at his feet
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the abbess
By this I think the dial points at five
Anon Im sure the duke himself in person
Comes this way to the melancholy vale
The place of death and sorry execution
Behind the ditches of the abbey here
Upon what cause
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant
Who put unluckily into this bay
Against the laws and statutes of this town
Beheaded publicly for his offence
See where they come we will behold his death
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
Enter DUKE SOLINUS attended AEGEON bareheaded with the Headsman and other Officers
Yet once again proclaim it publicly
If any friend will pay the sum for him
He shall not die so much we tender him
Justice most sacred duke against the abbess
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
May it please your grace Antipholus my husband
Whom I made lord of me and all I had
At your important lettersthis ill day
A most outrageous fit of madness took him
That desperately he hurried through the street
With him his bondman all as mad as he
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses bearing thence
Rings jewels any thing his rage did like
Once did I get him bound and sent him home
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
That here and there his fury had committed
Anon I wot not by what strong escape
He broke from those that had the guard of him
And with his mad attendant and himself
Each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
Met us again and madly bent on us
Chased us away till raising of more aid
We came again to bind them Then they fled
Into this abbey whither we pursued them
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
And will not suffer us to fetch him out
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
Therefore most gracious duke with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
Long since thy husband served me in my wars
And I to thee engaged a princes word
When thou didst make him master of thy bed
To do him all the grace and good I could
Go some of you knock at the abbeygate
And bid the lady abbess come to me
I will determine this before I stir
Enter a Servant
O mistress mistress shift and save yourself
My master and his man are both broke loose
Beaten the maids arow and bound the doctor
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire
And ever as it blazed they threw on him
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
My master preaches patience to him and the while
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool
And sure unless you send some present help
Between them they will kill the conjurer
Peace fool thy master and his man are here
And that is false thou dost report to us
Mistress upon my life I tell you true
I have not breathed almost since I did see it
He cries for you and vows if he can take you
To scorch your face and to disfigure you
Cry within
Hark hark I hear him mistress fly be gone
Come stand by me fear nothing Guard with halberds
Ay me it is my husband Witness you
That he is borne about invisible
Even now we housed him in the abbey here
And now hes there past thought of human reason
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
ANTIPHOLUS
Justice most gracious duke O grant me justice
Even for the service that long since I did thee
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
Deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
That then I lost for thee now grant me justice
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio
ANTIPHOLUS
Justice sweet prince against that woman there
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife
That hath abused and dishonourd me
Even in the strength and height of injury
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me
Discover how and thou shalt find me just
ANTIPHOLUS
This day great duke she shut the doors upon me
While she with harlots feasted in my house
A grievous fault Say woman didst thou so
No my good lord myself he and my sister
Today did dine together So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal
Neer may I look on day nor sleep on night
But she tells to your highness simple truth
O perjured woman They are both forsworn
In this the madman justly chargeth them
ANTIPHOLUS
My liege I am advised what I say
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine
Nor headyrash provoked with raging ire
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
This woman lockd me out this day from dinner
That goldsmith there were he not packd with her
Could witness it for he was with me then
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine
Where Balthazar and I did dine together
Our dinner done and he not coming thither
I went to seek him in the street I met him
And in his company that gentleman
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain
Which God he knows I saw not for the which
He did arrest me with an officer
I did obey and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats he with none returnd
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house
By the way we met
My wife her sister and a rabble more
Of vile confederates Along with them
They brought one Pinch a hungry leanfaced villain
A mere anatomy a mountebank
A threadbare juggler and a fortuneteller
A needy holloweyed sharplooking wretch
A deadlooking man this pernicious slave
Forsooth took on him as a conjurer
And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
And with no face as twere outfacing me
Cries out I was possessd Then all together
They fell upon me bound me bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man both bound together
Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
I gaind my freedom and immediately
Ran hither to your grace whom I beseech
For these deep shames and great indignities
My lord in truth thus far I witness with him
That he dined not at home but was lockd out
But had he such a chain of thee or no
He had my lord and when he ran in here
These people saw the chain about his neck
Besides I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
After you first forswore it on the mart
And thereupon I drew my sword on you
And then you fled into this abbey here
From whence I think you are come by miracle
ANTIPHOLUS
I never came within these abbeywalls
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
I never saw the chain so help me Heaven
And this is false you burden me withal
Why what an intricate impeach is this
I think you all have drunk of Circes cup
If here you housed him here he would have been
If he were mad he would not plead so coldly
You say he dined at home the goldsmith here
Denies that saying Sirrah what say you
Sir he dined with her there at the Porpentine
He did and from my finger snatchd that ring
ANTIPHOLUS
Tis true my liege this ring I had of her
Sawst thou him enter at the abbey here
As sure my liege as I do see your grace
Why this is strange Go call the abbess hither
I think you are all mated or stark mad
Exit one to Abbess
Most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
Haply I see a friend will save my life
And pay the sum that may deliver me
Speak freely Syracusian what thou wilt
Is not your name sir calld Antipholus
And is not that your bondman Dromio
Within this hour I was his bondman sir
But he I thank him gnawd in two my cords
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound
I am sure you both of you remember me
Ourselves we do remember sir by you
For lately we were bound as you are now
You are not Pinchs patient are you sir
Why look you strange on me you know me well
I never saw you in my life till now
O grief hath changed me since you saw me last
And careful hours with times deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face
But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
ANTIPHOLUS
Neither
Dromio nor thou
No trust me sir nor I
I am sure thou dost
Ay sir but I am sure I do not and whatsoever a
man denies you are now bound to believe him
Not know my voice O times extremity
Hast thou so crackd and splitted my poor tongue
In seven short years that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sapconsuming winters drizzled snow
And all the conduits of my blood froze up
Yet hath my night of life some memory
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear
All these old witnessesI cannot err
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus
ANTIPHOLUS
I never saw my father in my life
But seven years since in Syracusa boy
Thou knowst we parted but perhaps my son
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery
ANTIPHOLUS
The duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so
I neer saw Syracusa in my life
I tell thee Syracusian twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus
During which time he neer saw Syracusa
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote
Reenter AEMILIA with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
Most mighty duke behold a man much wrongd
All gather to see them
I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me
One of these men is Genius to the other
And so of these Which is the natural man
And which the spirit who deciphers them
I sir am Dromio command him away
I sir am Dromio pray let me stay
ANTIPHOLUS
AEgeon art thou not or else his ghost
O my old master who hath bound him here
Whoever bound him I will loose his bonds
And gain a husband by his liberty
Speak old AEgeon if thou best the man
That hadst a wife once calld AEmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons
O if thou best the same AEgeon speak
And speak unto the same AEmilia
If I dream not thou art AEmilia
If thou art she tell me where is that son
That floated with thee on the fatal raft
By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in
Why here begins his morning story right
These two Antipholuses these two so like
And these two Dromios one in semblance
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea
These are the parents to these children
Which accidentally are met together
Antipholus thou camest from Corinth first
ANTIPHOLUS
No sir not I I came from Syracuse
Stay stand apart I know not which is which
ANTIPHOLUS
I came from Corinth my most gracious lord
And I with him
ANTIPHOLUS
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior
Duke Menaphon your most renowned uncle
Which of you two did dine with me today
ANTIPHOLUS
I gentle mistress
And are not you my husband
ANTIPHOLUS
No I say nay to that
ANTIPHOLUS
And so do I yet did she call me so
And this fair gentlewoman her sister here
Did call me brother
To Luciana
What I told you then
I hope I shall have leisure to make good
If this be not a dream I see and hear
That is the chain sir which you had of me
ANTIPHOLUS
I think it be sir I deny it not
ANTIPHOLUS
And you sir for this chain arrested me
I think I did sir I deny it not
I sent you money sir to be your bail
By Dromio but I think he brought it not
No none by me
ANTIPHOLUS
This purse of ducats I received from you
And Dromio my man did bring them me
I see we still did meet each others man
And I was taen for him and he for me
And thereupon these errors are arose
ANTIPHOLUS
These ducats pawn I for my father here
It shall not need thy father hath his life
Sir I must have that diamond from you
ANTIPHOLUS
There take it and much thanks for my good cheer
Renowned duke vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes
And all that are assembled in this place
That by this sympathized one days error
Have sufferd wrong go keep us company
Thirtythree years have I but gone in travail
Of you my sons and till this present hour
My heavy burden neer delivered
The duke my husband and my children both
And you the calendars of their nativity
Go to a gossips feast and go with me
After so long grief such festivity
With all my heart Ill gossip at this feast
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse Antipholus of Ephesus Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus
Master shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard
ANTIPHOLUS
Dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embarkd
Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur
ANTIPHOLUS
He speaks to me I am your master Dromio
Come go with us well look to that anon
Embrace thy brother there rejoice with him
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus
There is a fat friend at your masters house
That kitchend me for you today at dinner
She now shall be my sister not my wife
Methinks you are my glass and not my brother
I see by you I am a sweetfaced youth
Will you walk in to see their gossiping
Not I sir you are my elder
Thats a question how shall we try it
Well draw cuts for the senior till then lead thou first
Nay then thus
We came into the world like brother and brother
And now lets go hand in hand not one before another
Exeunt
Enter a company of mutinous Citizens with staves clubs and other weapons
Before we proceed any further hear me speak
Speak speak
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish
Resolved resolved
First you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people
We knowt we knowt
Let us kill him and well have corn at our own price
Ist a verdict
No more talking ont let it be done away away
One word good citizens
We are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
What authority surfeits on would relieve us if they
would yield us but the superfluity while it were
wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely
but they think we are too dear the leanness that
afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius
Against him first hes a very dog to the commonalty
Consider you what services he has done for his country
Very well and could be content to give him good
report fort but that he pays himself with being proud
Nay but speak not maliciously
I say unto you what he hath done famously he did
it to that end though softconscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud which he
is even till the altitude of his virtue
What he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him You must in no way say he is covetous
If I must not I need not be barren of accusations
he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
Shouts within
What shouts are these The other side o the city
is risen why stay we prating here to the Capitol
Come come
Soft who comes here
Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
Worthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always loved
the people
Hes one honest enough would all the rest were so
What works my countrymen in hand where go you
With bats and clubs The matter speak I pray you
Our business is not unknown to the senate they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
which now well show em in deeds They say poor
suitors have strong breaths they shall know we
have strong arms too
Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
Will you undo yourselves
We cannot sir we are undone already
I tell you friends most charitable care
Have the patricians of you For your wants
Your suffering in this dearth you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state whose course will on
The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment For the dearth
The gods not the patricians make it and
Your knees to them not arms must help Alack
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you and you slander
The helms o the state who care for you like fathers
When you curse them as enemies
Care for us True indeed They neer cared for us
yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses
crammed with grain make edicts for usury to
established against the rich and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain
the poor If the wars eat us not up they will and
theres all the love they bear us
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious
Or be accused of folly I shall tell you
A pretty tale it may be you have heard it
But since it serves my purpose I will venture
To stale t a little more
Well Ill hear it sir yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please
you deliver
There was a time when all the bodys members
Rebelld against the belly thus accused it
That only like a gulf it did remain
Still cupboarding the viand never bearing
Like labour with the rest where the other instruments
Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
And mutually participate did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body The belly answerd
Well sir what answer made the belly
Sir I shall tell you With a kind of smile
Which neer came from the lungs but even thus
For look you I may make the belly smile
As well as speakit tauntingly replied
To the discontented members the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you
Your bellys answer What
The kinglycrowned head the vigilant eye
The counsellor heart the arm our soldier
Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
With other muniments and petty helps
In this our fabric if that they
What then
Fore me this fellow speaks What then what then
Should by the cormorant belly be restraind
Who is the sink o the body
Well what then
The former agents if they did complain
What could the belly answer
I will tell you
If youll bestow a smallof what you have little
Patience awhile youll hear the bellys answer
Yere long about it
Note me this good friend
Your most grave belly was deliberate
Not rash like his accusers and thus answerd
True is it my incorporate friends quoth he
That I receive the general food at first
Which you do live upon and fit it is
Because I am the storehouse and the shop
Of the whole body but if you do remember
I send it through the rivers of your blood
Even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain
And through the cranks and offices of man
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live and though that all at once
You my good friendsthis says the belly mark me
Ay sir well well
Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each
Yet I can make my audit up that all
From me do back receive the flour of all
And leave me but the bran What say you tot
It was an answer how apply you this
The senators of Rome are this good belly
And you the mutinous members for examine
Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
Touching the weal o the common you shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves What do you think
You the great toe of this assembly
I the great toe why the great toe
For that being one o the lowest basest poorest
Of this most wise rebellion thou gost foremost
Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
Leadst first to win some vantage
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle
The one side must have bale
Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
Hail noble Marcius
Thanks Whats the matter you dissentious rogues
That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
Make yourselves scabs
We have ever your good word
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring What would you have you curs
That like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
The other makes you proud He that trusts to you
Where he should find you lions finds you hares
Where foxes geese you are no surer no
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate and your affections are
A sick mans appetite who desires most that
Which would increase his evil He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes Hang ye Trust Ye
With every minute you do change a mind
And call him noble that was now your hate
Him vile that was your garland Whats the matter
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate who
Under the gods keep you in awe which else
Would feed on one another Whats their seeking
For corn at their own rates whereof they say
The city is well stored
Hang em They say
Theyll sit by the fire and presume to know
Whats done i the Capitol whos like to rise
and give out
Conjectural marriages making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes They say theres
grain enough
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
And let me use my sword Ill make a quarry
With thousands of these quarterd slaves as high
As I could pick my lance
Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
For though abundantly they lack discretion
Yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you
What says the other troop
They are dissolved hang em
They said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs
That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only with these shreds
They vented their complainings which being answerd
And a petition granted them a strange one
To break the heart of generosity
And make bold power look palethey threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o the moon
Shouting their emulation
What is granted them
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
Of their own choice ones Junius Brutus
Sicinius Velutus and I know notSdeath
The rabble should have first unroofd the city
Ere so prevaild with me it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrections arguing
This is strange
Go get you home you fragments
Enter a Messenger hastily
Wheres Caius Marcius
Here whats the matter
The news is sir the Volsces are in arms
I am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent
Our musty superfluity See our best elders
Enter COMINIUS TITUS LARTIUS and other Senators JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS
Marcius tis true that you have lately told us
The Volsces are in arms
They have a leader
Tullus Aufidius that will put you to t
I sin in envying his nobility
And were I any thing but what I am
I would wish me only he
You have fought together
Were half to half the world by the ears and he
Upon my party Ild revolt to make
Only my wars with him he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt
Then worthy Marcius
Attend upon Cominius to these wars
It is your former promise
Sir it is
And I am constant Titus Lartius thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus face
What art thou stiff standst out
No Caius Marcius
Ill lean upon one crutch and fight with tother
Ere stay behind this business
O truebred
Your company to the Capitol where I know
Our greatest friends attend us
To COMINIUS                Lead you on
To MARCIUS
Right worthy you priority
Noble Marcius
To the Citizens  Hence to your homes be gone
Nay let them follow
The Volsces have much corn take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners Worshipful mutiners
Your valour puts well forth pray follow
Citizens steal away Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius
He has no equal
When we were chosen tribunes for the people
Markd you his lip and eyes
Nay but his taunts
Being moved he will not spare to gird the gods
Bemock the modest moon
The present wars devour him he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant
Such a nature
Tickled with good success disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius
Fame at the which he aims
In whom already hes well graced can not
Better be held nor more attaind than by
A place below the first for what miscarries
Shall be the generals fault though he perform
To the utmost of a man and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius O if he
Had borne the business
Besides if things go well
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius
Come
Half all Cominius honours are to Marcius
Though Marcius earned them not and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours though indeed
In aught he merit not
Lets hence and hear
How the dispatch is made and in what fashion
More than his singularity he goes
Lets along
Exeunt
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators
So your opinion is Aufidius
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
And know how we proceed
Is it not yours
What ever have been thought on in this state
Had circumvention Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence these are the words I think
I have the letter here yes here it is
Reads
They have pressd a power but it is not known
Whether for east or west the dearth is great
The people mutinous and it is rumourd
Cominius Marcius your old enemy
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you
And Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman
These three lead on this preparation
Whither tis bent most likely tis for you
Consider of it
Our armys in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veild till when
They needs must show themselves which
in the hatching
It seemd appeard to Rome By the discovery
We shall be shortend in our aim which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot
Noble Aufidius
Take your commission hie you to your bands
Let us alone to guard Corioli
If they set down before s for the remove
Bring your army but I think youll find
Theyve not prepared for us
O doubt not that
I speak from certainties Nay more
Some parcels of their power are forth already
And only hitherward I leave your honours
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet
Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more
The gods assist you
And keep your honours safe
Farewell
Farewell
Farewell
Exeunt
Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIAthey set them down on two low stools and sew
I pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort if my son were my husband I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love When yet he was but
tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when
for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding I considering
how honour would become such a person that it was
no better than picturelike to hang by the wall if
renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame To a cruel
war I sent him from whence he returned his brows
bound with oak I tell thee daughter I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man
But had he died in the business madam how then
Then his good report should have been my son I
therein would have found issue Hear me profess
sincerely had I a dozen sons each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Marcius I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
Enter a Gentlewoman
Madam the Lady Valeria is come to visit you
Beseech you give me leave to retire myself
Indeed you shall not
Methinks I hear hither your husbands drum
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair
As children from a bear the Volsces shunning him
Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus
Come on you cowards you were got in fear
Though you were born in Rome his bloody brow
With his maild hand then wiping forth he goes
Like to a harvestman thats taskd to mow
Or all or lose his hire
His bloody brow O Jupiter no blood
Away you fool it more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy the breasts of Hecuba
When she did suckle Hector lookd not lovelier
Than Hectors forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword contemning Tell Valeria
We are fit to bid her welcome
Exit Gentlewoman
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius
Hell beat Aufidius head below his knee
And tread upon his neck
Enter VALERIA with an Usher and Gentlewoman
My ladies both good day to you
Sweet madam
I am glad to see your ladyship
How do you both you are manifest housekeepers
What are you sewing here A fine spot in good
faith How does your little son
I thank your ladyship well good madam
He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than
look upon his schoolmaster
O my word the fathers son Ill sweartis a
very pretty boy O my troth I looked upon him o
Wednesday half an hour together has such a
confirmed countenance I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly and when he caught it he let it go
again and after it again and over and over he
comes and again catched it again or whether his
fall enraged him or how twas he did so set his
teeth and tear it O I warrant it how he mammocked
it
One on s fathers moods
Indeed la tis a noble child
A crack madam
Come lay aside your stitchery I must have you play
the idle husewife with me this afternoon
No good madam I will not out of doors
Not out of doors
She shall she shall
Indeed no by your patience Ill not over the
threshold till my lord return from the wars
Fie you confine yourself most unreasonably come
you must go visit the good lady that lies in
I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with
my prayers but I cannot go thither
Why I pray you
Tis not to save labour nor that I want love
You would be another Penelope yet they say all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths Come I would your cambric
were sensible as your finger that you might leave
pricking it for pity Come you shall go with us
No good madam pardon me indeed I will not forth
In truth la go with me and Ill tell you
excellent news of your husband
O good madam there can be none yet
Verily I do not jest with you there came news from
him last night
Indeed madam
In earnest its true I heard a senator speak it
Thus it is the Volsces have an army forth against
whom Cominius the general is gone with one part of
our Roman power your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars This is true
on mine honour and so I pray go with us
Give me excuse good madam I will obey you in every
thing hereafter
Let her alone lady as she is now she will but
disease our better mirth
In troth I think she would Fare you well then
Come good sweet lady Prithee Virgilia turn thy
solemness out o door and go along with us
No at a word madam indeed I must not I wish
you much mirth
Well then farewell
Exeunt
Enter with drum and colours MARCIUS TITUS  LARTIUS Captains and Soldiers To them a Messenger
Yonder comes news A wager they have met
My horse to yours no
Tis done
Agreed
Say has our general met the enemy
They lie in view but have not spoke as yet
So the good horse is mine
Ill buy him of you
No Ill nor sell nor give him lend you him I will
For half a hundred years Summon the town
How far off lie these armies
Within this mile and half
Then shall we hear their larum and they ours
Now Mars I prithee make us quick in work
That we with smoking swords may march from hence
To help our fielded friends Come blow thy blast
They sound a parley Enter two Senators with others on the walls
Tutus Aufidius is he within your walls
No nor a man that fears you less than he
Thats lesser than a little
Drums afar off
Hark our drums
Are bringing forth our youth Well break our walls
Rather than they shall pound us up our gates
Which yet seem shut we have but pinnd with rushes
Theyll open of themselves
Alarum afar off
Hark you far off
There is Aufidius list what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army
O they are at it
Their noise be our instruction Ladders ho
Enter the army of the Volsces
They fear us not but issue forth their city
Now put your shields before your hearts and fight
With hearts more proof than shields Advance
brave Titus
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
Which makes me sweat with wrath Come on my fellows
He that retires Ill take him for a Volsce
And he shall feel mine edge
Alarum The Romans are beat back to their trenches Reenter MARCIUS cursing
All the contagion of the south light on you
You shames of Rome you herd ofBoils and plagues
Plaster you oer that you may be abhorrd
Further than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile You souls of geese
That bear the shapes of men how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat Pluto and hell
All hurt behind backs red and faces pale
With flight and agued fear Mend and charge home
Or by the fires of heaven Ill leave the foe
And make my wars on you look tot come on
If youll stand fast well beat them to their wives
As they us to our trenches followed
Another alarum The Volsces fly and MARCIUS follows them to the gates
So now the gates are ope now prove good seconds
Tis for the followers fortune widens them
Not for the fliers mark me and do the like
Enters the gates
Foolhardiness not I
Nor I
MARCIUS is shut in
See they have shut him in
To the pot I warrant him
Alarum continues
Reenter TITUS LARTIUS
What is become of Marcius
Slain sir doubtless
Following the fliers at the very heels
With them he enters who upon the sudden
Clappd to their gates he is himself alone
To answer all the city
O noble fellow
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
And when it bows stands up Thou art left Marcius
A carbuncle entire as big as thou art
Were not so rich a jewel Thou wast a soldier
Even to Catos wish not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
The thunderlike percussion of thy sounds
Thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble
Reenter MARCIUS bleeding assaulted by the enemy
Look sir
Otis Marcius
Lets fetch him off or make remain alike
They fight and all enter the city
Enter certain Romans with spoils
This will I carry to Rome
And I this
A murrain ont I took this for silver
Alarum continues still afar off
Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crackd drachm Cushions leaden spoons
Irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them these base slaves
Ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them
And hark what noise the general makes To him
There is the man of my souls hate Aufidius
Piercing our Romans then valiant Titus take
Convenient numbers to make good the city
Whilst I with those that have the spirit will haste
To help Cominius
Worthy sir thou bleedst
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
A second course of fight
Sir praise me not
My work hath yet not warmd me fare you well
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me to Aufidius thus
I will appear and fight
Now the fair goddess Fortune
Fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers swords Bold gentleman
Prosperity be thy page
Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest So farewell
Thou worthiest Marcius
Exit MARCIUS
Go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace
Call thither all the officers o the town
Where they shall know our mind away
Exeunt
Enter COMINIUS as it were in retire with soldiers
Breathe you my friends well fought
we are come off
Like Romans neither foolish in our stands
Nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs
We shall be charged again Whiles we have struck
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends Ye Roman gods
Lead their successes as we wish our own
That both our powers with smiling
fronts encountering
May give you thankful sacrifice
Enter a Messenger
Thy news
The citizens of Corioli have issued
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle
I saw our party to their trenches driven
And then I came away
Though thou speakst truth
Methinks thou speakst not well
How long ist since
Above an hour my lord
Tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
And bring thy news so late
Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase that I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about else had I sir
Half an hour since brought my report
Whos yonder
That does appear as he were flayd O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius and I have
Beforetime seen him thus
Within                 Come I too late
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know the sound of Marcius tongue
From every meaner man
Enter MARCIUS
Come I too late
Ay if you come not in the blood of others
But mantled in your own
O let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I wood in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done
And tapers burnd to bedward
Flower of warriors
How is it with Titus Lartius
As with a man busied about decrees
Condemning some to death and some to exile
Ransoming him or pitying threatening the other
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
To let him slip at will
Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches
Where is he call him hither
Let him alone
He did inform the truth but for our gentlemen
The common filea plague tribunes for them
The mouse neer shunnd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they
But how prevaild you
Will the time serve to tell I do not think
Where is the enemy are you lords o the field
If not why cease you till you are so
Marcius
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose
How lies their battle know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust
As I guess Marcius
Their bands i the vaward are the Antiates
Of their best trust oer them Aufidius
Their very heart of hope
I do beseech you
By all the battles wherein we have fought
By the blood we have shed together by the vows
We have made to endure friends that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates
And that you not delay the present but
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts
We prove this very hour
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to you yet dare I never
Deny your asking take your choice of those
Those are they
That most are willing If any such be here
As it were sin to doubtthat love this painting
Wherein you see me smeard if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his countrys dearer than himself
Let him alone or so many so minded
Wave thus to express his disposition
And follow Marcius
They all shout and wave their swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps
O me alone make you a sword of me
If these shows be not outward which of you
But is four Volsces none of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his A certain number
Though thanks to all must I select
from all the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight
As cause will be obeyd Please you to march
And four shall quickly draw out my command
Which men are best inclined
March on my fellows
Make good this ostentation and you shall
Divide in all with us
Exeunt
TITUS LARTIUS having set a guard upon  Corioli going with drum and trumpet toward  COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS enters with Lieutenant other Soldiers and a Scout
So let the ports be guarded keep your duties
As I have set them down If I do send dispatch
Those centuries to our aid the rest will serve
For a short holding if we lose the field
We cannot keep the town
Fear not our care sir
Hence and shut your gates upons
Our guider come to the Roman camp conduct us
Exeunt
Alarum as in battle Enter from opposite sides MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS
Ill fight with none but thee for I do hate thee
Worse than a promisebreaker
We hate alike
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy Fix thy foot
Let the first budger die the others slave
And the gods doom him after
If I fly Marcius
Holloa me like a hare
Within these three hours Tullus
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls
And made what work I pleased tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me maskd for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your braggd progeny
Thou shouldst not scape me here
They fight and certain Volsces come to the aid of  AUFIDIUS MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless
Officious and not valiant you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds
Exeunt
Flourish Alarum A retreat is sounded Flourish  Enter from one side COMINIUS with the Romans from the other side MARCIUS with his arm in a scarf
If I should tell thee oer this thy days work
Thouldst not believe thy deeds but Ill report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug
I the end admire where ladies shall be frighted
And gladly quaked hear more where the
dull tribunes
That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
Shall say against their hearts We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast
Having fully dined before
Enter TITUS LARTIUS with his power from the pursuit
O general
Here is the steed we the caparison
Hadst thou beheld
Pray now no more my mother
Who has a charter to extol her blood
When she does praise me grieves me I have done
As you have done thats what I can induced
As you have been thats for my country
He that has but effected his good will
You shall not be
The grave of your deserving Rome must know
The value of her own twere a concealment
Worse than a theft no less than a traducement
To hide your doings and to silence that
Which to the spire and top of praises vouchd
Would seem but modest therefore I beseech you
In sign of what you are not to reward
What you have donebefore our army hear me
I have some wounds upon me and they smart
To hear themselves rememberd
Should they not
Well might they fester gainst ingratitude
And tent themselves with death Of all the horses
Whereof we have taen good and good store of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city
We render you the tenth to be taen forth
Before the common distribution at
Your only choice
I thank you general
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword I do refuse it
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing
A long flourish They all cry Marcius Marcius  cast up their caps and lances COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
May these same instruments which you profane
Never sound more when drums and trumpets shall
I the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
Made all of falsefaced soothing
When steel grows soft as the parasites silk
Let him be made a coverture for the wars
No more I say For that I have not washd
My nose that bled or foild some debile wretch
Which without note heres many else have done
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies
Too modest are you
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly by your patience
If gainst yourself you be incensed well put you
Like one that means his proper harm in manacles
Then reason safely with you Therefore be it known
As to us to all the world that Caius Marcius
Wears this wars garland in token of the which
My noble steed known to the camp I give him
With all his trim belonging and from this time
For what he did before Corioli call him
With all the applause and clamour of the host
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS Bear
The addition nobly ever
Flourish Trumpets sound and drums
Caius Marcius Coriolanus
I will go wash
And when my face is fair you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no howbeit I thank you
I mean to stride your steed and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power
So to our tent
Where ere we do repose us we will write
To Rome of our success You Titus Lartius
Must to Corioli back send us to Rome
The best with whom we may articulate
For their own good and ours
I shall my lord
The gods begin to mock me I that now
Refused most princely gifts am bound to beg
Of my lord general
Taket tis yours What ist
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor mans house he used me kindly
He cried to me I saw him prisoner
But then Aufidius was with in my view
And wrath oerwhelmd my pity I request you
To give my poor host freedom
O well beggd
Were he the butcher of my son he should
Be free as is the wind Deliver him Titus
Marcius his name
By Jupiter forgot
I am weary yea my memory is tired
Have we no wine here
Go we to our tent
The blood upon your visage dries tis time
It should be lookd to come
Exeunt
A flourish Cornets Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody with two or three Soldiers
The town is taen
Twill be deliverd back on good condition
Condition
I would I were a Roman for I cannot
Being a Volsce be that I am Condition
What good condition can a treaty find
I the part that is at mercy Five times Marcius
I have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me
And wouldst do so I think should we encounter
As often as we eat By the elements
If eer again I meet him beard to beard
Hes mine or I am his mine emulation
Hath not that honour int it had for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force
True sword to sword Ill potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him
Hes the devil
Bolder though not so subtle My valours poisond
With only suffering stain by him for him
Shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary
Being naked sick nor fane nor Capitol
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice
Embarquements all of fury shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom gainst
My hate to Marcius where I find him were it
At home upon my brothers guard even there
Against the hospitable canon would I
Wash my fierce hand ins heart Go you to the city
Learn how tis held and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome
Will not you go
I am attended at the cypress grove I pray you
Tis south the city millsbring me word thither
How the world goes that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey
I shall sir
Exeunt
Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people SICINIUS and BRUTUS
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
Good or bad
Not according to the prayer of the people for they
love not Marcius
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends
Pray you who does the wolf love
The lamb
Ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
noble Marcius
Hes a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
Hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb You two
are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you
Well sir
In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two
have not in abundance
Hes poor in no one fault but stored with all
Especially in pride
And topping all others in boasting
This is strange now do you two know how you are
censured here in the city I mean of us o the
righthand file do you
Why how are we censured
Because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry
Well well sir well
Why tis no great matter for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience
give your dispositions the reins and be angry at
your pleasures at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so You blame Marcius for
being proud
We do it not alone sir
I know you can do very little alone for your helps
single your abilities are too infantlike for
doing much alone You talk of pride O that you
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks
and make but an interior survey of your good selves
O that you could
What then sir
Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as
any in Rome
Menenius you are known well enough too
I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber int said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike
upon too trivial motion one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning what I think I utter and spend my
malice in my breath Meeting two such wealsmen as
you areI cannot call you Lycurgusesif the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely I make a
crooked face at it I cant say your worships have
delivered the matter well when I find the ass in
compound with the major part of your syllables and
though I must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces If you see this in
the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known
well enough too what barm can your bisson
known well enough too
Come sir come we know you well enough
You know neither me yourselves nor any thing You
are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience When you are hearing a
matter between party and party if you chance to be
pinched with the colic you make faces like
mummers set up the bloody flag against all
patience and in roaring for a chamberpot
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing all the peace you make in their
cause is calling both the parties knaves You are
a pair of strange ones
Come come you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol
Our very priests must become mockers if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When
you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the
wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers
cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack
saddle Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud
who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors
since Deucalion though peradventure some of the
best of em were hereditary hangmen Godden to
your worships more of your conversation would
infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you
BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside
Enter VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA and VALERIA
How now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon
were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow
your eyes so fast
Honourable Menenius my boy Marcius approaches for
the love of Juno lets go
Ha Marcius coming home
Ay worthy Menenius and with most prosperous
approbation
Take my cap Jupiter and I thank thee Hoo
Marcius coming home
Naytis true
Look heres a letter from him the state hath
another his wife another and I think theres one
at home for you
I will make my very house reel tonight a letter for
me
Yes certain theres a letter for you I sawt
A letter for me it gives me an estate of seven
years health in which time I will make a lip at
the physician the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative
of no better report than a horsedrench Is he
not wounded he was wont to come home wounded
O no no no
O he is wounded I thank the gods fort
So do I too if it be not too much brings a
victory in his pocket the wounds become him
Ons brows Menenius he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly
Titus Lartius writes they fought together but
Aufidius got off
And twas time for him too Ill warrant him that
an he had stayed by him I would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli and the gold
thats in them Is the senate possessed of this
Good ladies lets go Yes yes yes the senate
has letters from the general wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war he hath in this
In troth theres wondrous things spoke of him
Wondrous ay I warrant you and not without his
true purchasing
The gods grant them true
True pow wow
True Ill be sworn they are true
Where is he wounded
To the Tribunes
God save your good worships Marcius is coming
home he has more cause to be proud Where is he wounded
I the shoulder and i the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people when he shall
stand for his place He received in the repulse of
Tarquin seven hurts i the body
One i the neck and two i the thightheres
nine that I know
He had before this last expedition twentyfive
wounds upon him
Now its twentyseven every gash was an enemys grave
A shout and flourish
Hark the trumpets
These are the ushers of Marcius before him he
carries noise and behind him he leaves tears
Death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie
Which being advanced declines and then men die
A sennet Trumpets sound Enter COMINIUS the  general and TITUS LARTIUS between them CORIOLANUS  crowned with an oaken garland with Captains and Soldiers and a Herald
Know Rome that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates where he hath won
With fame a name to Caius Marcius these
In honour follows Coriolanus
Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus
Flourish
Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus
No more of this it does offend my heart
Pray now no more
Look sir your mother
O
You have I know petitiond all the gods
For my prosperity
Kneels
Nay my good soldier up
My gentle Marcius worthy Caius and
By deedachieving honour newly named
What is itCoriolanus must I call thee
But O thy wife
My gracious silence hail
Wouldst thou have laughd had I come coffind home
That weepst to see me triumph Ay my dear
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear
And mothers that lack sons
Now the gods crown thee
And live you yet
To VALERIA
O my sweet lady pardon
I know not where to turn O welcome home
And welcome general and yere welcome all
A hundred thousand welcomes I could weep
And I could laugh I am light and heavy Welcome
A curse begin at very root ons heart
That is not glad to see thee You are three
That Rome should dote on yet by the faith of men
We have some old crabtrees here
at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish Yet welcome warriors
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly
Ever right
Menenius ever ever
Give way there and go on
To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA  Your hand and yours
Ere in our own house I do shade my head
The good patricians must be visited
From whom I have received not only greetings
But with them change of honours
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy only
Theres one thing wanting which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee
Know good mother
I had rather be their servant in my way
Than sway with them in theirs
On to the Capitol
Flourish Cornets Exeunt in state as before BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward
All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram bout her reechy neck
Clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows
Are smotherd up leads filld and ridges horsed
With variable complexions all agreeing
In earnestness to see him seldshown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station or veild dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus burning kisses such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture
On the sudden
I warrant him consul
Then our office may
During his power go sleep
He cannot temperately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end but will
Lose those he hath won
In that theres comfort
Doubt not
The commoners for whom we stand but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to dot
I heard him swear
Were he to stand for consul never would he
Appear i the marketplace nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility
Nor showing as the manner is his wounds
To the people beg their stinking breaths
Tis right
It was his word O he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution
Tis most like he will
It shall be to him then as our good wills
A sure destruction
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities For an end
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them that tos power he would
Have made them mules silenced their pleaders and
Dispropertied their freedoms holding them
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the war who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens and sore blows
For sinking under them
This as you say suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want
If he be put upon t and thats as easy
As to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever
Enter a Messenger
Whats the matter
You are sent for to the Capitol Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
Upon him as he passd the nobles bended
As to Joves statue and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
I never saw the like
Lets to the Capitol
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time
But hearts for the event
Have with you
Exeunt
Enter two Officers to lay cushions
Come come they are almost here How many stand
for consulships
Three they say but tis thought of every one
Coriolanus will carry it
Thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and
loves not the common people
Faith there had been many great men that have
flattered the people who neer loved them and there
be many that they have loved they know not
wherefore so that if they love they know not why
they hate upon no better a ground therefore for
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly seet
If he did not care whether he had their love or no
he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither
good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes to flatter them for their love
He hath deserved worthily of his country and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who
having been supple and courteous to the people
bonneted without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation and report but he hath so
in their hearts that for their tongues to be
silent and not confess so much were a kind of
ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a
malice that giving itself the lie would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it
No more of him he is a worthy man make way they
are coming
Having determined of the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius it remains
As the main point of this our aftermeeting
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country therefore
please you
Most reverend and grave elders to desire
The present consul and last general
In our wellfound successes to report
A little of that worthy work performd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honours like himself
Speak good Cominius
Leave nothing out for length and make us think
Rather our states defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out
To the Tribunes
Masters o the people
We do request your kindest ears and after
Your loving motion toward the common body
To yield what passes here
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly
Which the rather
We shall be blest to do if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at
Thats off thats off
I would you rather had been silent Please you
To hear Cominius speak
Most willingly
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it
He loves your people
But tie him not to be their bedfellow
Worthy Cominius speak
CORIOLANUS offers to go away
Nay keep your place
Sit Coriolanus never shame to hear
What you have nobly done
Your horrors pardon
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them
Sir I hope
My words disbenchd you not
No sir yet oft
When blows have made me stay I fled from words
You soothed not therefore hurt not but
your people
I love them as they weigh
Pray now sit down
I had rather have one scratch my head i the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monsterd
Exit
Masters of the people
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one ons ears to hear it Proceed Cominius
I shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utterd feebly It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue and
Most dignifies the haver if it be
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years
When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought
Beyond the mark of others our then dictator
Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him be bestrid
An oerpressd Roman and i the consuls view
Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met
And struck him on his knee in that days feats
He proved best man i the field and for his meed
Was browbound with the oak His pupil age
Manenterd thus he waxed like a sea
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurchd all swords of the garland For this last
Before and in Corioli let me say
I cannot speak him home he stoppd the fliers
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport as weeds before
A vessel under sail so men obeyd
And fell below his stem his sword deaths stamp
Where it did mark it took from face to foot
He was a thing of blood whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries alone he enterd
The mortal gate of the city which he painted
With shunless destiny aidless came off
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet now alls his
When by and by the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
Requickend what in flesh was fatigate
And to the battle came he where he did
Run reeking oer the lives of men as if
Twere a perpetual spoil and till we calld
Both field and city ours he never stood
To ease his breast with panting
Worthy man
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him
Our spoils he kickd at
And lookd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world he covets less
Than misery itself would give rewards
His deeds with doing them and is content
To spend the time to end it
Hes right noble
Let him be calld for
Call Coriolanus
He doth appear
Reenter CORIOLANUS
The senate Coriolanus are well pleased
To make thee consul
I do owe them still
My life and services
It then remains
That you do speak to the people
I do beseech you
Let me oerleap that custom for I cannot
Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
For my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you
That I may pass this doing
Sir the people
Must have their voices neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony
Put them not tot
Pray you go fit you to the custom and
Take to you as your predecessors have
Your honour with your form
It is apart
Be taken from the people
Mark you that
To brag unto them thus I did and thus
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only
Do not stand upont
We recommend to you tribunes of the people
Our purpose to them and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour
Flourish of cornets Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
You see how he intends to use the people
May they perceives intent He will require them
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give
Come well inform them
Of our proceedings here on the marketplace
I know they do attend us
Exeunt
Enter seven or eight Citizens
Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him
We may sir if we will
We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
power that we have no power to do for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if
he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is
monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful
were to make a monster of the multitude of the
which we being members should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members
And to make us no better thought of a little help
will serve for once we stood up about the corn he
himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude
We have been called so of many not that our heads
are some brown some black some auburn some bald
but that our wits are so diversely coloured and
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull they would fly east west north south
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o the compass
Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would
fly
Nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans
willtis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but
if it were at liberty twould sure southward
Why that way
To lose itself in a fog where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return
for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife
You are never without your tricks you may you may
Are you all resolved to give your voices But
thats no matter the greater part carries it I
say if he would incline to the people there was
never a worthier man
Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility with MENENIUS
Here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his
behavior We are not to stay all together but to
come by him where he stands by ones by twos and
by threes Hes to make his requests by
particulars wherein every one of us has a single
honour in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues therefore follow me and I direct you how
you shall go by him
Content content
Exeunt Citizens
O sir you are not right have you not known
The worthiest men have donet
What must I say
I Pray sirPlague upont I cannot bring
My tongue to such a paceLook sir my wounds
I got them in my countrys service when
Some certain of your brethren roard and ran
From the noise of our own drums
O me the gods
You must not speak of that you must desire them
To think upon you
Think upon me hang em
I would they would forget me like the virtues
Which our divines lose by em
Youll mar all
Ill leave you pray you speak to em I pray you
In wholesome manner
Exit
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean
Reenter two of the Citizens
So here comes a brace
Reenter a third Citizen
You know the cause air of my standing here
We do sir tell us what hath brought you tot
Mine own desert
Your own desert
Ay but not mine own desire
How not your own desire
No sirtwas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging
You must think if we give you any thing we hope to
gain by you
Well then I pray your price o the consulship
The price is to ask it kindly
Kindly Sir I pray let me hat I have wounds to
show you which shall be yours in private Your
good voice sir what say you
You shall ha it worthy sir
A match sir Theres in all two worthy voices
begged I have your alms adieu
But this is something odd
An twere to give againbut tis no matter
Exeunt the three Citizens
Reenter two other Citizens
Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul I have here the
customary gown
You have deserved nobly of your country and you
have not deserved nobly
Your enigma
You have been a scourge to her enemies you have
been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved
the common people
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love I will sir flatter my
sworn brother the people to earn a dearer
estimation of them tis a condition they account
gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly that is sir I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you
I may be consul
We hope to find you our friend and therefore give
you our voices heartily
You have received many wounds for your country
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I
will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further
The gods give you joy sir heartily
Exeunt
Most sweet voices
Better it is to die better to starve
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here
To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
Their needless vouches Custom calls me tot
What custom wills in all things should we dot
The dust on antique time would lie unswept
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to oerpeer Rather than fool it so
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus I am half through
The one part sufferd the other will I do
Reenter three Citizens more
Here come more voices
Your voices for your voices I have fought
Watchd for your voices for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of for your voices have
Done many things some less some more your voices
Indeed I would be consul
He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
mans voice
Therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy
and make him good friend to the people
Amen amen God save thee noble consul
Exeunt
Worthy voices
Reenter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS
You have stood your limitation and the tribunes
Endue you with the peoples voice remains
That in the official marks invested you
Anon do meet the senate
Is this done
The custom of request you have discharged
The people do admit you and are summond
To meet anon upon your approbation
Where at the senatehouse
There Coriolanus
May I change these garments
You may sir
That Ill straight do and knowing myself again
Repair to the senatehouse
Ill keep you company Will you along
We stay here for the people
Fare you well
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
He has it now and by his looks methink
Tis warm at s heart
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds
will you dismiss the people
Reenter Citizens
How now my masters have you chose this man
He has our voices sir
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves
Amen sir to my poor unworthy notice
He mockd us when he beggd our voices
Certainly
He flouted us downright
Notis his kind of speech he did not mock us
Not one amongst us save yourself but says
He used us scornfully he should have showd us
His marks of merit wounds received fors country
Why so he did I am sure
No no no man saw em
He said he had wounds which he could show
in private
And with his hat thus waving it in scorn
I would be consul says he aged custom
But by your voices will not so permit me
Your voices therefore When we granted that
Here was I thank you for your voices thank you
Your most sweet voices now you have left
your voices
I have no further with you Was not this mockery
Why either were you ignorant to seet
Or seeing it of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices
Could you not have told him
As you were lessond when he had no power
But was a petty servant to the state
He was your enemy ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I the body of the weal and now arriving
A place of potency and sway o the state
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii your voices might
Be curses to yourselves You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love
Standing your friendly lord
Thus to have said
As you were foreadvised had touchd his spirit
And tried his inclination from him pluckd
Either his gracious promise which you might
As cause had calld you up have held him to
Or else it would have galld his surly nature
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught so putting him to rage
You should have taen the advantage of his choler
And passd him unelected
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies
No heart among you or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment
Have you
Ere now denied the asker and now again
Of him that did not ask but mock bestow
Your suedfor tongues
Hes not confirmd we may deny him yet
And will deny him
Ill have five hundred voices of that sound
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece em
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so
Let them assemble
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election enforce his pride
And his old hate unto you besides forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed
How in his suit he scornd you but your loves
Thinking upon his services took from you
The apprehension of his present portance
Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you
Lay
A fault on us your tribunes that we laboured
No impediment between but that you must
Cast your election on him
Say you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections and that your minds
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should made you against the grain
To voice him consul lay the fault on us
Ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you
How youngly he began to serve his country
How long continued and what stock he springs of
The noble house o the Marcians from whence came
That Ancus Marcius Numas daughters son
Who after great Hostilius here was king
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were
That our beat water brought by conduits hither
And  Censorinus  nobly named so
Twice being  by the people chosen  censor
Was his great ancestor
One thus descended
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place we did commend
To your remembrances but you have found
Scaling his present bearing with his past
That hes your fixed enemy and revoke
Your sudden approbation
Say you neer had donet
Harp on that stillbut by our putting on
And presently when you have drawn your number
Repair to the Capitol
We will so almost all
Repent in their election
Exeunt Citizens
Let them go on
This mutiny were better put in hazard
Than stay past doubt for greater
If as his nature is he fall in rage
With their refusal both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger
To the Capitol come
We will be there before the stream o the people
And this shall seem as partly tis their own
Which we have goaded onward
Exeunt
Cornets Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS all the Gentry COMINIUS TITUS LARTIUS and other Senators
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head
He had my lord and that it was which caused
Our swifter composition
So then the Volsces stand but as at first
Ready when time shall prompt them to make road
Upons again
They are worn lord consul so
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again
Saw you Aufidius
On safeguard he  came to me and did curse
Against the Volsces for they had so vilely
Yielded the town he is retired to Antium
Spoke he of me
He did my lord
How what
How often he had met you sword to sword
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution so he might
Be calld your vanquisher
At Antium lives he
At Antium
I wish I had a cause to seek him there
To oppose his hatred fully Welcome home
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Behold these are the tribunes of the people
The tongues o the common mouth I do despise them
For they do prank them in authority
Against all noble sufferance
Pass no further
Ha what is that
It will be dangerous to go on no further
What makes this change
The matter
Hath he not passd the noble and the common
Cominius no
Have I had childrens voices
Tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace
The people are incensed against him
Stop
Or all will fall in broil
Are these your herd
Must these have voices that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues What are
your offices
You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
Have you not set them on
Be calm be calm
It is a purposed thing and grows by plot
To curb the will of the nobility
Suffert and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled
Callt not a plot
The people cry you mockd them and of late
When corn was given them gratis you repined
Scandald the suppliants for the people calld them
Timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
Why this was known before
Not to them all
Have you informd them sithence
How I inform them
You are like to do such business
Not unlike
Each way to better yours
Why then should I be consul By yond clouds
Let me deserve so ill as you and make me
Your fellow tribune
You show too much of that
For which the people stir if you will pass
To where you are bound you must inquire your way
Which you are out of with a gentler spirit
Or never be so noble as a consul
Nor yoke with him for tribune
Lets be calm
The people are abused set on This paltering
Becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonourd rub laid falsely
I the plain way of his merit
Tell me of corn
This was my speech and I will speakt again
Not now not now
Not in this heat sir now
Now as I live I will My nobler friends
I crave their pardons
For the mutable rankscented many let them
Regard me as I do not flatter and
Therein behold themselves I say again
In soothing them we nourish gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
Which we ourselves have ploughd for sowd
and scatterd
By mingling them with us the honourd number
Who lack not virtue no nor power but that
Which they have given to beggars
Well no more
No more words we beseech you
How no more
As for my country I have shed my blood
Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles
Which we disdain should tatter us yet sought
The very way to catch them
You speak o the people
As if you were a god to punish not
A man of their infirmity
Twere well
We let the people knowt
What what his choler
Choler
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep
By Jove twould be my mind
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is
Not poison any further
Shall remain
Hear you this Triton of the minnows mark you
His absolute shall
Twas from the canon
Shall
O good but most unwise patricians why
You grave but reckless senators have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer
That with his peremptory shall being but
The horn and noise o the monsters wants not spirit
To say hell turn your current in a ditch
And make your channel his If he have power
Then vail your ignorance if none awake
Your dangerous lenity If you are learnd
Be not as common fools if you are not
Let them have cushions by you You are plebeians
If they be senators and they are no less
When both your voices blended the greatst taste
Most palates theirs They choose their magistrate
And such a one as he who puts his shall
His popular shall against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece By Jove himself
It makes the consuls base and my soul aches
To know when two authorities are up
Neither supreme how soon confusion
May enter twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other
Well on to the marketplace
Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
The corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used
Sometime in Greece
Well well no more of that
Though there the people had more absolute power
I say they nourishd disobedience fed
The ruin of the state
Why shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice
Ill give my reasons
More worthier than their voices They know the corn
Was not our recompense resting well assured
That neer did service fort being pressd to the war
Even when the navel of the state was touchd
They would not thread the gates This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis Being i the war
Their mutinies and revolts wherein they showd
Most valour spoke not for them the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate
All cause unborn could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation Well what then
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senates courtesy Let deeds express
Whats like to be their words we did request it
We are the greater poll and in true fear
They gave us our demands Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears which will in time
Break ope the locks o the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles
Come enough
Enough with overmeasure
No take more
What may be sworn by both divine and human
Seal what I end withal This double worship
Where one part does disdain with cause the other
Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignoranceit must omit
Real necessities and give way the while
To unstable slightness purpose so barrd
it follows
Nothing is done to purpose Therefore beseech you
You that will be less fearful than discreet
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change ont that prefer
A noble life before a long and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
Thats sure of death without it at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should becomet
Not having the power to do the good it would
For the in which doth controlt
Has said enough
Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
As traitors do
Thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee
What should the people do with these bald tribunes
On whom depending their obedience fails
To the greater bench in a rebellion
When whats not meet but what must be was law
Then were they chosen in a better hour
Let what is meet be said it must be meet
And throw their power i the dust
Manifest treason
This a consul no
The aediles ho
Enter an AEdile
Let him be apprehended
Go call the people
Exit AEdile
in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator
A foe to the public weal obey I charge thee
And follow to thine answer
Hence old goat
Senators  and CWell surety him
Aged sir hands off
Hence rotten thing or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments
Help ye citizens
Enter a rabble of Citizens Plebeians with the AEdiles
On both sides more respect
Heres he that would take from you all your power
Seize him AEdiles
Down with him down with him
Senators  and CWeapons weapons weapons
They all bustle about CORIOLANUS crying
Tribunes Patricians Citizens What ho
Sicinius Brutus Coriolanus Citizens
Peace peace peace Stay hold peace
What is about to be I am out of breath
Confusions near I cannot speak You tribunes
To the people Coriolanus patience
Speak good Sicinius
Hear me people peace
Lets hear our tribune peace Speak speak speak
You are at point to lose your liberties
Marcius would have all from you Marcius
Whom late you have named for consul
Fie fie fie
This is the way to kindle not to quench
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat
What is the city but the people
True
The people are the city
By the consent of all we were establishd
The peoples magistrates
You so remain
And so are like to do
That is the way to lay the city flat
To bring the roof to the foundation
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
In heaps and piles of ruin
This deserves death
Or let us stand to our authority
Or let us lose it We do here pronounce
Upon the part o the people in whose power
We were elected theirs Marcius is worthy
Of present death
Therefore lay hold of him
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian and from thence
Into destruction cast him
AEdiles seize him
Yield Marcius yield
Hear me one word
Beseech you tribunes hear me but a word
Peace peace
To BRUTUS  Be that you seem truly your
countrys friend
And temperately proceed to what you would
Thus violently redress
Sir those cold ways
That seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent Lay hands upon him
And bear him to the rock
No Ill die here
Drawing his sword
Theres some among you have beheld me fighting
Come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
Down with that sword Tribunes withdraw awhile
Lay hands upon him
Help Marcius help
You that be noble help him young and old
Down with him down with him
In this mutiny the Tribunes the AEdiles and the People are beat in
Go get you to your house be gone away
All will be naught else
Get you gone
Stand fast
We have as many friends as enemies
Sham it be put to that
The gods forbid
I prithee noble friend home to thy house
Leave us to cure this cause
For tis a sore upon us
You cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you
Come sir along with us
I would they were barbariansas they are
Though in Rome litterdnot Romansas they are not
Though calved i the porch o the Capitol
Be gone
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue
One time will owe another
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them
I could myself
Take up a brace o the best of them yea the
two tribunes
But now tis odds beyond arithmetic
And manhood is calld foolery when it stands
Against a falling fabric Will you hence
Before the tag return whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and oerbear
What they are used to bear
Pray you be gone
Ill try whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little this must be patchd
With cloth of any colour
Nay come away
Exeunt CORIOLANUS COMINIUS and others
This man has marrd his fortune
His nature is too noble for the world
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident
Or Jove fors power to thunder His hearts his mouth
What his breast forges that his tongue must vent
And being angry does forget that ever
He heard the name of death
A noise within
Heres goodly work
I would they were abed
I would they were in Tiber What the vengeance
Could he not speak em fair
Reenter BRUTUS and SICINIUS with the rabble
Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself
You worthy tribunes
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands he hath resisted law
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought
He shall well know
The noble tribunes are the peoples mouths
And we their hands
He shall sure ont
Sir sir
Peace
Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
With modest warrant
Sir how comest that you
Have holp to make this rescue
Hear me speak
As I do know the consuls worthiness
So can I name his faults
Consul what consul
The consul Coriolanus
He consul
No no no no no
If by the tribunes leave and yours good people
I may be heard I would crave a word or two
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time
Speak briefly then
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor to eject him hence
Were but one danger and to keep him here
Our certain death therefore it is decreed
He dies tonight
Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enrolld
In Joves own book like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own
Hes a disease that must be cut away
O hes a limb that has but a disease
Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
What has he done to Rome thats worthy death
Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
By many an ouncehe droppd it for his country
And what is left to lose it by his country
Were to us all that dot and suffer it
A brand to the end o the world
This is clean kam
Merely awry when he did love his country
It honourd him
The service of the foot
Being once gangrened is not then respected
For what before it was
Well hear no more
Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
Lest his infection being of catching nature
Spread further
One word more one word
This tigerfooted rage when it shall find
The harm of unscannd swiftness will too late
Tie leaden pounds tos heels Proceed by process
Lest parties as he is beloved break out
And sack great Rome with Romans
If it were so
What do ye talk
Have we not had a taste of his obedience
Our aediles smote ourselves resisted Come
Consider this he has been bred i the wars
Since he could draw a sword and is ill schoold
In bolted language meal and bran together
He throws without distinction Give me leave
Ill go to him and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer by a lawful form
In peace to his utmost peril
Noble tribunes
It is the humane way the other course
Will prove too bloody and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning
Noble Menenius
Be you then as the peoples officer
Masters lay down your weapons
Go not home
Meet on the marketplace Well attend you there
Where if you bring not Marcius well proceed
In our first way
Ill bring him to you
To the Senators
Let me desire your company he must come
Or what is worst will follow
Pray you lets to him
Exeunt
Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians
Let them puff all about mine ears present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses heels
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight yet will I still
Be thus to them
You do the nobler
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further who was wont
To call them woollen vassals things created
To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
In congregations to yawn be still and wonder
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war
Enter VOLUMNIA
I talk of you
Why did you wish me milder would you have me
False to my nature Rather say I play
The man I am
O sir sir sir
I would have had you put your power well on
Before you had worn it out
Let go
You might have been enough the man you are
With striving less to be so lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions if
You had not showd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lackd power to cross you
Let them hang
Ay and burn too
Enter MENENIUS and Senators
Come come you have been too rough something
too rough
You must return and mend it
Theres no remedy
Unless by not so doing our good city
Cleave in the midst and perish
Pray be counselld
I have a heart as little apt as yours
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage
Well said noble woman
Before he should thus stoop to the herd but that
The violent fit o the time craves it as physic
For the whole state I would put mine armour on
Which I can scarcely bear
What must I do
Return to the tribunes
Well what then what then
Repent what you have spoke
For them I cannot do it to the gods
Must I then dot to them
You are too absolute
Though therein you can never be too noble
But when extremities speak I have heard you say
Honour and policy like unseverd friends
I the war do grow together grant that and tell me
In peace what each of them by the other lose
That they combine not there
Tush tush
A good demand
If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not which for your best ends
You adopt your policy how is it less or worse
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour as in war since that to both
It stands in like request
Why force you this
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people not by your own instruction
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you
But with such words that are but rooted in
Your tongue though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosoms truth
Now this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour I am in this
Your wife your son these senators the nobles
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon em
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin
Noble lady
Come go with us speak fair you may salve so
Not what is dangerous present but the loss
Of what is past
I prithee now my son
Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
And thus far having stretchd ithere be with them
Thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business
More learned than the earswaving thy head
Which often thus correcting thy stout heart
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling or say to them
Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim
In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
As thou hast power and person
This but done
Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
For they have pardons being askd as free
As words to little purpose
Prithee now
Go and be ruled although I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower Here is Cominius
Enter COMINIUS
I have been i the marketplace and sirtis fit
You make strong party or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence alls in anger
Only fair speech
I think twill serve if he
Can thereto frame his spirit
He must and will
Prithee now say you will and go about it
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear Well I will dot
Yet were there but this single plot to lose
This mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it
And throwt against the wind To the marketplace
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life
Come come well prompt you
I prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier so
To have my praise for this perform a part
Thou hast not done before
Well I must dot
Away my disposition and possess me
Some harlots spirit my throat of war be turnd
Which quired with my drum into a pipe
Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up
The glasses of my sight a beggars tongue
Make motion through my lips and my armd knees
Who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his
That hath received an alms I will not dot
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
A most inherent baseness
At thy choice then
To beg of thee it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them Come all to ruin let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou Do as thou list
Thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me
But owe thy pride thyself
Pray be content
Mother I am going to the marketplace
Chide me no more Ill mountebank their loves
Cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
Of all the trades in Rome Look I am going
Commend me to my wife Ill return consul
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I the way of flattery further
Do your will
Exit
Away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself
To answer mildly for they are prepared
With accusations as I hear more strong
Than are upon you yet
The word is mildly Pray you let us go
Let them accuse me by invention I
Will answer in mine honour
Ay but mildly
Well mildly be it then Mildly
Exeunt
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
In this point charge him home that he affects
Tyrannical power if he evade us there
Enforce him with his envy to the people
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was neer distributed
Enter an AEdile
What will he come
Hes coming
How accompanied
With old Menenius and those senators
That always favourd him
Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll
I have tis ready
Have you collected them by tribes
I have
Assemble presently the people hither
And when they bear me say It shall be so
I the right and strength o the commons be it either
For death for fine or banishment then let them
If I say fine cry Fine if death cry Death
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i the truth o the cause
I shall inform them
And when such time they have begun to cry
Let them not cease but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence
Very well
Make them be strong and ready for this hint
When we shall hap to give t them
Go about it
Exit AEdile
Put him to choler straight he hath been used
Ever to conquer and to have his worth
Of contradiction being once chafed he cannot
Be reind again to temperance then he speaks
Whats in his heart and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck
Well here he comes
Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS and COMINIUS with Senators and Patricians
Calmly I do beseech you
Ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume The honourd gods
Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men plant love among s
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace
And not our streets with war
Amen amen
A noble wish
Reenter AEdile with Citizens
Draw near ye people
List to your tribunes Audience peace I say
First hear me speak
Well say Peace ho
Shall I be charged no further than this present
Must all determine here
I do demand
If you submit you to the peoples voices
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be proved upon you
I am content
Lo citizens he says he is content
The warlike service he has done consider think
Upon the wounds his body bears which show
Like graves i the holy churchyard
Scratches with briers
Scars to move laughter only
Consider further
That when he speaks not like a citizen
You find him like a soldier do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds
But as I say such as become a soldier
Rather than envy you
Well well no more
What is the matter
That being passd for consul with full voice
I am so dishonourd that the very hour
You take it off again
Answer to us
Say then tis true I ought so
We charge you that you have contrived to take
From Rome all seasond office and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical
For which you are a traitor to the people
How traitor
Nay temperately your promise
The fires i the lowest hell foldin the people
Call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
In thy hand clutchd as many millions in
Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say
Thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods
Mark you this people
To the rock to the rock with him
Peace
We need not put new matter to his charge
What you have seen him do and heard him speak
Beating your officers cursing yourselves
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
Those whose great power must try him even this
So criminal and in such capital kind
Deserves the extremest death
But since he hath
Served well for Rome
What do you prate of service
I talk of that that know it
You
Is this the promise that you made your mother
Know I pray you
I know no further
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death
Vagabond exile raying pent to linger
But with a grain a day I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give
To havet with saying Good morrow
For that he has
As much as in him lies from time to time
Envied against the people seeking means
To pluck away their power as now at last
Given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice but on the ministers
That do distribute it in the name o the people
And in the power of us the tribunes we
Even from this instant banish him our city
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates i the peoples name
I say it shall be so
It shall be so it shall be so let him away
Hes banishd and it shall be so
Hear me my masters and my common friends
Hes sentenced no more hearing
Let me speak
I have been consul and can show for Rome
Her enemies marks upon me I do love
My countrys good with a respect more tender
More holy and profound than mine own life
My dear wifes estimate her wombs increase
And treasure of my loins then if I would
Speak that
We know your drift speak what
Theres no more to be said but he is banishd
As enemy to the people and his country
It shall be so
It shall be so it shall be so
You common cry of curs whose breath I hate
As reek o the rotten fens whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air I banish you
And here remain with your uncertainty
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
Your enemies with nodding of their plumes
Fan you into despair Have the power still
To banish your defenders till at length
Your ignorance which finds not till it feels
Making not reservation of yourselves
Still your own foes deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows Despising
For you the city thus I turn my back
There is a world elsewhere
Exeunt CORIOLANUS COMINIUS MENENIUS Senators and Patricians
The peoples enemy is gone is gone
Our enemy is banishd he is gone Hoo hoo
Shouting and throwing up their caps

Attend us through the city
Come come lets see him out at gates come
The gods preserve our noble tribunes Come
Exeunt
Enter CORIOLANUS VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA MENENIUS COMINIUS with the young Nobility of Rome
Come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast
With many heads butts me away Nay mother
Where is your ancient courage you were used
To say extremity was the trier of spirits
That common chances common men could bear
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Showd mastership in floating fortunes blows
When most struck home being gentle wounded craves
A noble cunning you were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that connd them
O heavens O heavens
Nay prithee woman
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome
And occupations perish
What what what
I shall be loved when I am lackd Nay mother
Resume that spirit when you were wont to say
If you had been the wife of Hercules
Six of his labours yould have done and saved
Your husband so much sweat Cominius
Droop not adieu Farewell my wife my mother
Ill do well yet Thou old and true Menenius
Thy tears are salter than a younger mans
And venomous to thine eyes My sometime general
I have seen thee stem and thou hast oft beheld
Hearthardening spectacles tell these sad women
Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
As tis to laugh at em My mother you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace and
Believet not lightlythough I go alone
Like to a lonely dragon that his fen
Makes feard and talkd of more than seenyour son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
My first son
Whither wilt thou go Take good Cominius
With thee awhile determine on some course
More than a wild exposture to each chance
That starts i the way before thee
O the gods
Ill follow thee a month devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal we shall not send
Oer the vast world to seek a single man
And lose advantage which doth ever cool
I the absence of the needer
Fare ye well
Thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
Of the wars surfeits to go rove with one
Thats yet unbruised bring me but out at gate
Come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
My friends of noble touch when I am forth
Bid me farewell and smile I pray you come
While I remain above the ground you shall
Hear from me still and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly
Thats worthily
As any ear can hear Come lets not weep
If I could shake off but one seven years
From these old arms and legs by the good gods
Ild with thee every foot
Give me thy hand Come
Exeunt
Enter SICINIUS BRUTUS and an AEdile

Stand in their ancient strength

Cats that can judge as fitly of his worth

Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits
Take my prayers with you
Exeunt Tribunes

days journey
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections the
people against the senators patricians and nobles
Hath been is it ended then Our state thinks not
so they are in a most warlike preparation and
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division
The main blaze of it is past but a small thing
would make it flame again for the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their tribunes for ever This lies glowing I can
tell you and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out
Coriolanus banished
Banished sir
You will be welcome with this intelligence Nicanor
The day serves well for them now I have heard it
said the fittest time to corrupt a mans wife is
when shes fallen out with her husband Your noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars his
great opposer Coriolanus being now in no request

Exit Citizen
O world thy slippery turns Friends now fast sworn
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart
Whose house whose bed whose meal and exercise
Are still together who twin as twere in love
Unseparable shall within this hour

To bitterest enmity so fellest foes
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
To take the one the other by some chance
Some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues So with me
My birthplace hate I and my loves upon
This enemy town Ill enter if he slay me
He does fair justice if he give me way

Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman
Where is this fellow

Retires
Whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name
Why speakst not speak man whats thy name
If Tullus
Unmuffling
Not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not
Think me for the man I am necessity
Commands me name myself
What is thy name
A name unmusical to the Volscians ears
And harsh in sound to thine
Say whats thy name
Thou hast a grim appearance and thy face
Bears a command int though thy tackles torn
Thou showst a noble vessel whats thy name
Prepare thy brow to frown knowst
thou me yet
I know thee not thy name
My name is Caius Marcius who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
My surname Coriolanus the painful service
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname a good memory
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains
The cruelty and envy of the people
Permitted by our dastard nobles who
Have all forsook me hath devourd the rest
And sufferd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoopd out of Rome Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
Mistake me notto save my life for if
I had feard death of all the men i the world
I would have voided thee but in mere spite
To be full quit of those my banishers
Stand I before thee here Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country speed
thee straight
And make my misery serve thy turn so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee for I will fight
Against my cankerd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thourt tired then in a word I also am
Longer to live most weary and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool
Since I have ever followd thee with hate
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breast
And cannot live but to thy shame unless
It be to do thee service
O Marcius Marcius
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things
And say Tis true Ild not believe them more
Than thee all noble Marcius Let me twine
Mine arms about that body where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarrd the moon with splinters here I clip
The anvil of my sword and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour Know thou first
I loved the maid I married never man
Sighd truer breath but that I see thee here
Thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold Why thou Mars I tell thee
We have a power on foot and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
Or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
We have been down together in my sleep
Unbuckling helms fisting each others throat
And waked half dead with nothing Worthy Marcius
Had we no quarrel else to Rome but that
Thou art thence banishd we would muster all
From twelve to seventy and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome
Like a bold flood oerbear O come go in
And take our friendly senators by the hands
Who now are here taking their leaves of me
Who am prepared against your territories
Though not for Rome itself
You bless me gods
Therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges take
The one half of my commission and set down
As best thou art experienced since thou knowst
Thy countrys strength and weaknessthine own ways
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome
Or rudely visit them in parts remote
To fright them ere destroy But come in
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes
And more a friend than eer an enemy
Yet Marcius that was much Your hand most welcome
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS The two Servingmen come forward
Heres a strange alteration
By my hand I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him
What an arm he has he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
Nay I knew by his face that there was something in
him he had sir a kind of face methoughtI
cannot tell how to term it
He had so looking as it werewould I were hanged
but I thought there was more in him than I could think
So did I Ill be sworn he is simply the rarest
man i the world
I think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on
Who my master
Nay its no matter for that
Worth six on him
Nay not so neither but I take him to be the
greater soldier
Faith look you one cannot tell how to say that
for the defence of a town our general is excellent
Ay and for an assault too
Reenter third Servingman
O slaves I can tell you news news you rascals
What what what lets partake
I would not be a Roman of all nations I had as
lieve be a condemned man
Wherefore wherefore
Why heres he that was wont to thwack our general
Caius Marcius
Why do you say thwack our general 
I do not say thwack our general but he was always
good enough for him
Come we are fellows and friends he was ever too
hard for him I have heard him say so himself
He was too hard for him directly to say the troth
ont before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado
An he had been cannibally given he might have
broiled and eaten him too
But more of thy news
Why he is so made on here within as if he were son
and heir to Mars set at upper end o the table no
question asked him by any of the senators but they
stand bald before him our general himself makes a
mistress of him sanctifies himself withs hand and
turns up the white o the eye to his discourse But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table Hell go he says
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears he
will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled
And hes as like to dot as any man I can imagine
Dot he will dot for look you sir he has as
many friends as enemies which friends sir as it
were durst not look you sir show themselves as
we term it his friends whilst hes in directitude
Directitude whats that
But when they shall see sir his crest up again
and the man in blood they will out of their
burrows like conies after rain and revel all with
him
But when goes this forward
Tomorrow today presently you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a
parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips
Why then we shall have a stirring world again
This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase
tailors and breed balladmakers
Let me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as
day does night its spritely waking audible and
full of vent Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy
mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more
bastard children than wars a destroyer of men
Tis so and as war in some sort may be said to
be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds
Ay and it makes men hate one another
Reason because they then less need one another
The wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians They are rising they are rising
In in in in
Exeunt
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
We hear not of him neither need we fear him
His remedies are tame i the present peace
And quietness of the people which before
Were in wild hurry Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well who rather had
Though they themselves did suffer byt behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly
We stood tot in good time
Enter MENENIUS
Is this Menenius
Tis hetis he O he is grown most kind of late
Hail sir
Hail to you both
Your Coriolanus
Is not much missd but with his friends
The commonwealth doth stand and so would do
Were he more angry at it
Alls well and might have been much better if
He could have temporized
Where is he hear you
Nay I hear nothing his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him
Enter three or four Citizens
The gods preserve you both
Godden our neighbours
Godden to you all godden to you all
Ourselves our wives and children on our knees
Are bound to pray for you both
Live and thrive
Farewell kind neighbours we wishd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did
Now the gods keep you
Farewell farewell
Exeunt Citizens
This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets
Crying confusion
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i the war but insolent
Oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
Selfloving
And affecting one sole throne
Without assistance
I think not so
We should by this to all our lamentation
If he had gone forth consul found it so
The gods have well prevented it and Rome
Sits safe and still without him
Enter an AEdile
Worthy tribunes
There is a slave whom we have put in prison
Reports the Volsces with two several powers
Are enterd in the Roman territories
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before em
Tis Aufidius
Who hearing of our Marcius banishment
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world
Which were inshelld when Marcius stood for Rome
And durst not once peep out
Come what talk you
Of Marcius
Go see this rumourer whippd It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us
Cannot be
We have record that very well it can
And three examples of the like have been
Within my age But reason with the fellow
Before you punish him where he heard this
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded
Tell not me
I know this cannot be
Not possible
Enter a Messenger
The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senatehouse some news is come
That turns their countenances
Tis this slave
Go whip him fore the peoples eyeshis raising
Nothing but his report
Yes worthy sir
The slaves report is seconded and more
More fearful is deliverd
What more fearful
It is spoke freely out of many mouths
How probable I do not knowthat Marcius
Joind with Aufidius leads a power gainst Rome
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The youngst and oldest thing
This is most likely
Raised only that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again
The very trick ont
This is unlikely
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety
Enter a second Messenger
You are sent for to the senate
A fearful army led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius rages
Upon our territories and have already
Oerborne their way consumed with fire and took
What lay before them
Enter COMINIUS
O you have made good work
What news what news
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates
To see your wives dishonourd to your noses
Whats the news whats the news
Your temples burned in their cement and
Your franchises whereon you stood confined
Into an augers bore
Pray now your news
You have made fair work I fear mePray your news
If Marcius should be joind with Volscians
If
He is their god he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature
That shapes man better and they follow him
Against us brats with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies
Or butchers killing flies
You have made good work
You and your apronmen you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garliceaters
He will shake
Your Rome about your ears
As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit
You have made fair work
But is this true sir
Ay and youll look pale
Before you find it other All the regions
Do smilingly revolt and who resist
Are mockd for valiant ignorance
And perish constant fools Who ist can blame him
Your enemies and his find something in him
We are all undone unless
The noble man have mercy
Who shall ask it
The tribunes cannot dot for shame the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
Should say Be good to Rome they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate
And therein showd like enemies
Tis true
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it I have not the face
To say Beseech you cease You have made fair hands
You and your crafts you have crafted fair
You have brought
A trembling upon Rome such as was never
So incapable of help
Say not we brought it
How Was it we we loved him but like beasts
And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
Who did hoot him out o the city
But I fear
Theyll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius
The second name of men obeys his points
As if he were his officer desperation
Is all the policy strength and defence
That Rome can make against them
Enter a troop of Citizens
Here come the clusters
And is Aufidius with him You are they
That made the air unwholesome when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus exile Now hes coming
And not a hair upon a soldiers head
Which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down
And pay you for your voices Tis no matter
if he could burn us all into one coal
We have deserved it
Faith we hear fearful news
For mine own part
When I said banish him I said twas pity
And so did I
And so did I and to say the truth so did very
many of us that we did we did for the best and
though we willingly consented to his banishment yet
it was against our will
Ye re goodly things you voices
You have made
Good work you and your cry Shalls to the Capitol
O ay what else
Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
Go masters get you home be not dismayd
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear Go home
And show no sign of fear
The gods be good to us Come masters lets home
I ever said we were i the wrong when we banished
him
So did we all But come lets home
Exeunt Citizens
I do not like this news
Nor I
Lets to the Capitol Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie
Pray let us go
Exeunt
Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant
Do they still fly to the Roman
I do not know what witchcrafts in him but
Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
Their talk at table and their thanks at end
Even by your own
I cannot help it now
Unless by using means I lame the foot
Of our design He bears himself more proudlier
Even to my person than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him yet his nature
In thats no changeling and I must excuse
What cannot be amended
Yet I wish sir
I mean for your particularyou had not
Joind in commission with him but either
To him had left it solely
I understand thee well and be thou sure
when he shall come to his account he knows not
What I can urge against him Although it seems
And so he thinks and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state
Fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
Wheneer we come to our account
Sir I beseech you think you hell carry Rome
All places yield to him ere he sits down
And the nobility of Rome are his
The senators and patricians love him too
The tribunes are no soldiers and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
To expel him thence I think hell be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish who takes it
By sovereignty of nature First he was
A noble servant to them but he could not
Carry his honours even whether twas pride
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man whether defect of judgment
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of or whether nature
Not to be other than one thing not moving
From the casque to the cushion but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controlld the war but one of these
As he hath spices of them all not all
For I dare so far free himmade him feard
So hated and so banishd but he has a merit
To choke it in the utterance So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time
And power unto itself most commendable
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it hath done
One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
Come lets away When Caius Rome is thine
Thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine
Exeunt
Enter MENENIUS COMINIUS SICINIUS BRUTUS and others
No Ill not go you hear what he hath said
Which was sometime his general who loved him
In a most dear particular He calld me father
But what o that Go you that banishd him
A mile before his tent fall down and knee
The way into his mercy nay if he coyd
To hear Cominius speak Ill keep at home
He would not seem to know me
Do you hear
Yet one time he did call me by my name
I urged our old acquaintance and the drops
That we have bled together Coriolanus
He would not answer to forbad all names
He was a kind of nothing titleless
Till he had forged himself a name o the fire
Of burning Rome
Why so you have made good work
A pair of tribunes that have rackd for Rome
To make coals cheapa noble memory
I minded him how royal twas to pardon
When it was less expected he replied
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punishd
Very well
Could he say less
I offerd to awaken his regard
Fors private friends his answer to me was
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly
For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
And still to nose the offence
For one poor grain or two
I am one of those his mother wife his child
And this brave fellow too we are the grains
You are the musty chaff and you are smelt
Above the moon we must be burnt for you
Nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
In this so neverneeded help yet do not
Upbraids with our distress But sure if you
Would be your countrys pleader your good tongue
More than the instant army we can make
Might stop our countryman
No Ill not meddle
Pray you go to him
What should I do
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome towards Marcius
Well and say that Marcius
Return me as Cominius is returnd
Unheard what then
But as a discontented friend griefshot
With his unkindness sayt be so
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
As you intended well
Ill undertake t
I think hell hear me Yet to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me
He was not taken well he had not dined
The veins unfilld our blood is cold and then
We pout upon the morning are unapt
To give or to forgive but when we have stuffd
These and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding we have suppler souls
Than in our priestlike fasts therefore Ill watch him
Till he be dieted to my request
And then Ill set upon him
You know the very road into his kindness
And cannot lose your way
Good faith Ill prove him
Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success
Exit
Hell never hear him
Not
I tell you he does sit in gold his eye
Red as twould burn Rome and his injury
The gaoler to his pity I kneeld before him
Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissd me
Thus with his speechless hand what he would do
He sent in writing after me what he would not
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
So that all hope is vain
Unless his noble mother and his wife
Who as I hear mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country Therefore lets hence
And with our fair entreaties haste them on
Exeunt
Two Sentinels on guard
Enter to them MENENIUS
Stay whence are you
Stand and go back
You guard like men tis well but by your leave
I am an officer of state and come
To speak with Coriolanus
From whence
From Rome
You may not pass you must return our general
Will no more hear from thence
Youll see your Rome embraced with fire before
Youll speak with Coriolanus
Good my friends
If you have heard your general talk of Rome
And of his friends there it is lots to blanks
My name hath touchd your ears it is Menenius
Be it so go back the virtue of your name
Is not here passable
I tell thee fellow
The general is my lover I have been
His name unparalleld haply amplified
For I have ever verified my friends
Of whom hes chief with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
Have almost stampd the leasing therefore fellow
I must have leave to pass
Faith sir if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you have uttered words in your own you
should not pass here no though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely Therefore go back
Prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius
Howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
have I am one that telling true under him must
say you cannot pass Therefore go back
Has he dined canst thou tell for I would not
speak with him till after dinner
You are a Roman are you
I am as thy general is
Then you should hate Rome as he does Can you
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defender of them and in a violent popular
ignorance given your enemy your shield think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women the virginal palms of your daughters or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be Can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in with
such weak breath as this No you are deceived
therefore back to Rome and prepare for your
execution you are condemned our general has sworn
you out of reprieve and pardon
Sirrah if thy captain knew I were here he would
use me with estimation
Come my captain knows you not
I mean thy general
My general cares not for you Back I say go lest
I let forth your halfpint of blood backthats
the utmost of your having back
Nay but fellow fellow
Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
Whats the matter
Now you companion Ill say an errand for you
You shall know now that I am in estimation you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus guess but by my entertainment
with him if thou standest not i the state of
hanging or of some death more long in
spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now
presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee
To CORIOLANUS
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity and love thee no worse than
thy old father Menenius does O my son my son
thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres
water to quench it I was hardly moved to come to
thee but being assured none but myself could move
thee I have been blown out of your gates with
sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy
petitionary countrymen The good gods assuage thy
wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
herethis who like a block hath denied my
access to thee
Away
How away
Wife mother child I know not My affairs
Are servanted to others though I owe
My revenge properly my remission lies
In Volscian breasts That we have been familiar
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
Than pity note how much Therefore be gone
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Your gates against my force Yet for I loved thee
Take this along I writ it for thy sake
Gives a letter
And would have rent it Another word Menenius
I will not hear thee speak This man Aufidius
Was my beloved in Rome yet thou beholdst
You keep a constant temper
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
Now sir is your name Menenius
Tis a spell you see of much  power you know the
way home again
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back
What cause do you think I have to swoon
I neither care for the world nor your general for
such things as you I can scarce think theres any
yere so slight He that hath a will to die by
himself fears it not from another let your general
do his worst For you be that you are long and
your misery increase with your age I say to you
as I was said to Away
Exit
A noble fellow I warrant him
The worthy fellow is our general hes the rock the
oak not to be windshaken
Exeunt
Enter CORIOLANUS AUFIDIUS and others
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
You must report to the Volscian lords how plainly
I have borne this business
Only their ends
You have respected stoppd your ears against
The general suit of Rome never admitted
A private whisper no not with such friends
That thought them sure of you
This last old man
Whom with a crackd heart I have sent to Rome
Loved me above the measure of a father
Nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge
Was to send him for whose old love I have
Though I showd sourly to him once more offerd
The first conditions which they did refuse
And cannot now accept to grace him only
That thought he could do more a very little
I have yielded to fresh embassies and suits
Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
Will I lend ear to Ha what shout is this
Shout within
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time tis made I will not
Enter in mourning habits VIRGILIA VOLUMNIA leading young MARCIUS VALERIA and Attendants
My wife comes foremost then the honourd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood But out affection
All bond and privilege of nature break
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate
What is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes
Which can make gods forsworn I melt and am not
Of stronger earth than others My mother bows
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession which
Great nature cries Deny not let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Italy Ill never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin
My lord and husband
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think so
I have forgot my part and I am out
Even to a full disgrace Best of my flesh
Forgive my tyranny but do not say
For that Forgive our Romans O a kiss
Long as my exile sweet as my revenge
Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
I carried from thee dear and my true lip
Hath virgind it eer since You gods I prate
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted sink my knee i the earth
Kneels
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons
O stand up blest
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
I kneel before thee and unproperly
Show duty as mistaken all this while
Between the child and parent
Kneels
What is this
Your knees to me to your corrected son
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun
Murdering impossibility to make
What cannot be slight work
Thou art my warrior
I holp to frame thee Do you know this lady
The noble sister of Publicola
The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle
Thats curdied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dians temple dear Valeria
This is a poor epitome of yours
Which by the interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself
The god of soldiers
With the consent of supreme Jove inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars
Like a great seamark standing every flaw
And saving those that eye thee
Your knee sirrah
Thats my brave boy
Even he your wife this lady and myself
Are suitors to you
I beseech you peace
Or if yould ask remember this before
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
Again with Romes mechanics tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural desire not
To ally my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons
O no more no more
You have said you will not grant us any thing
For we have nothing else to ask but that
Which you deny already yet we will ask
That if you fail in our request the blame
May hang upon your hardness therefore hear us
Aufidius and you Volsces mark for well
Hear nought from Rome in private Your request
Should we be silent and not speak our raiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither since that thy sight
which should
Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance
with comforts
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
Making the mother wife and child to see
The son the husband and the father tearing
His countrys bowels out And to poor we
Thine enmitys most capital thou barrst us
Our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy for how can we
Alas how can we for our country pray
Whereto we are bound together with thy victory
Whereto we are bound alack or we must lose
The country our dear nurse or else thy person
Our comfort in the country We must find
An evident calamity though we had
Our wish which side should win for either thou
Must as a foreign recreant be led
With manacles thorough our streets or else
triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and childrens blood For myself son
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country than to tread
Trust tot thou shalt noton thy mothers womb
That brought thee to this world
Ay and mine
That brought you forth this boy to keep your name
Living to time
A shall not tread on me
Ill run away till I am bigger but then Ill fight
Not of a womans tenderness to be
Requires nor child nor womans face to see
I have sat too long
Rising
Nay go not from us thus
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
As poisonous of your honour no our suit
Is that you reconcile them while the Volsces
May say This mercy we have showd the Romans
This we received and each in either side
Give the allhail to thee and cry Be blest
For making up this peace Thou knowst great son
The end of wars uncertain but this certain
That if thou conquer Rome the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
Whose repetition will be doggd with curses
Whose chronicle thus writ The man was noble
But with his last attempt he wiped it out
Destroyd his country and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorrd Speak to me son
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
To imitate the graces of the gods
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak
Thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs Daughter speak you
He cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons Theres no man in the world
More bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate
Like one i the stocks Thou hast never in thy life
Showd thy dear mother any courtesy
When she poor hen fond of no second brood
Has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home
Loaden with honour Say my requests unjust
And spurn me back but if it be not so
Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
That thou restrainst from me the duty which
To a mothers part belongs He turns away
Down ladies let us shame him with our knees
To his surname Coriolanus longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers Down an end
This is the last so we will home to Rome
And die among our neighbours Nay behold s
This boy that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny t Come let us go
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch
I am hushd until our city be afire
And then Ill speak a little
He holds her by the hand silent
O mother mother
What have you done Behold the heavens do ope
They laugh at O my mother mother O
You have won a happy victory to Rome
But for your sonbelieve it O believe it
Most dangerously you have with him prevaild
If not most mortal to him But let it come
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars
Ill frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius
Were you in my stead would you have heard
A mother less or granted less Aufidius
I was moved withal
I dare be sworn you were
And sir it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir
What peace youll make advise me for my part
Ill not to Rome Ill back with you and pray you
Stand to me in this cause O mother wife
Aside  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
thy honour
At difference in thee out of that Ill work
Myself a former fortune
The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS
Ay by and by
To VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA  and c
But we will drink together and you shall bear
A better witness back than words which we
On like conditions will have counterseald
Come enter with us Ladies you deserve
To have a temple built you all the swords
In Italy and her confederate arms
Could not have made this peace
Exeunt
Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
See you yond coign o the Capitol yond
cornerstone
Why what of that
If it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger there is some hope the ladies of
Rome especially his mother may prevail with him
But I say there is no hope int our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution
Ist possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly
yet your butterfly was a grub This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon he has wings hes more than a
creeping thing
He loved his mother dearly
So did he me and he no more remembers his mother
now than an eightyearold horse The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he
moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before
his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a
battery He sits in his state as a thing made for
Alexander What he bids be done is finished with
his bidding He wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in
Yes mercy if you report him truly
mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger that
shall our poor city find and all this is long of
you
The gods be good unto us
No in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us When we banished him we respected not them
and he returning to break our necks they respect not us
Enter a Messenger
Sir if yould save your life fly to your house
The plebeians have got your fellowtribune
And hale him up and down all swearing if
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home
Theyll give him death by inches
Enter a second Messenger
Whats the news
Good news good news the ladies have prevaild
The Volscians are dislodged and Marcius gone
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome
No not the expulsion of the Tarquins
Friend
Art thou certain this is true is it most certain
As certain as I know the sun is fire
Where have you lurkd that you make doubt of it
Neer through an arch so hurried the blown tide
As the recomforted through the gates Why hark you
Trumpets hautboys drums beat all together
The trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans
Make the sun dance Hark you
A shout within
This is good news
I will go meet the ladies This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls senators patricians
A city full of tribunes such as you
A sea and land full You have prayd well today
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
Id not have given a doit Hark how they joy
Music still with shouts
First the gods bless you for your tidings next
Accept my thankfulness
Sir we have all
Great cause to give great thanks
They are near the city
Almost at point to enter
We will meet them
And help the joy
Exeunt
Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA  VALERIA  and c passing over the stage followed by Patricians and others
Behold our patroness the life of Rome
Call all your tribes together praise the gods
And make triumphant fires strew flowers before them
Unshout the noise that banishd Marcius
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother
Cry Welcome ladies welcome
Welcome ladies Welcome
A flourish with drums and trumpets Exeunt
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with Attendants
Go tell the lords o the city I am here
Deliver them this paper having read it
Bid them repair to the market place where I
Even in theirs and in the commons ears
Will vouch the truth of it Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enterd and
Intends to appear before the people hoping
To purge herself with words dispatch
Exeunt Attendants
Most welcome
How is it with our general
Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoisond
And with his charity slain
Most noble sir
If you do hold the same intent wherein
You wishd us parties well deliver you
Of your great danger
Sir I cannot tell
We must proceed as we do find the people
The people will remain uncertain whilst
Twixt you theres difference but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all
I know it
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction I raised him and I pawnd
Mine honour for his truth who being so heightend
He waterd his new plants with dews of flattery
Seducing so my friends and to this end
He bowd his nature never known before
But to be rough unswayable and free
Sir his stoutness
When he did stand for consul which he lost
By lack of stooping
That I would have spoke of
Being banishd fort he came unto my hearth
Presented to my knife his throat I took him
Made him jointservant with me gave him way
In all his own desires nay let him choose
Out of my files his projects to accomplish
My best and freshest men served his designments
In mine own person holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his and took some pride
To do myself this wrong till at the last
I seemd his follower not partner and
He waged me with his countenance as if
I had been mercenary
So he did my lord
The army marvelld at it and in the last
When he had carried Rome and that we lookd
For no less spoil than glory
There was it
For which my sinews shall be stretchd upon him
At a few drops of womens rheum which are
As cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
And Ill renew me in his fall But hark
Drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of the People
Your native town you enterd like a post
And had no welcomes home but he returns
Splitting the air with noise
And patient fools
Whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
With giving him glory
Therefore at your vantage
Ere he express himself or move the people
With what he would say let him feel your sword
Which we will second When he lies along
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with his body
Say no more
Here come the lords
Enter the Lords of the city
You are most welcome home
I have not deserved it
But worthy lords have you with heed perused
What I have written to you
We have
And grieve to heart
What faults he made before the last I think
Might have found easy fines but there to end
Where he was to begin and give away
The benefit of our levies answering us
With our own charge making a treaty where
There was a yieldingthis admits no excuse
He approaches you shall hear him
Enter CORIOLANUS marching with drum and colours commoners being with him
Hail lords I am returnd your soldier
No more infected with my countrys love
Than when I parted hence but still subsisting
Under your great command You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans and we here deliver
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians
Together with the seal o the senate what
We have compounded on
Read it not noble lords
But tell the traitor in the highst degree
He hath abused your powers
Traitor how now
Ay traitor Marcius
Marcius
Ay Marcius Caius Marcius dost thou think
Ill grace thee with that robbery thy stoln name
Coriolanus in Corioli
You lords and heads o the state perfidiously
He has betrayd your business and given up
For certain drops of salt your city Rome
I say your city to his wife and mother
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk never admitting
Counsel o the war but at his nurses tears
He whined and roard away your victory
That pages blushd at him and men of heart
Lookd wondering each at other
Hearst thou Mars
Name not the god thou boy of tears
Ha
No more
Measureless liar thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it Boy O slave
Pardon me lords tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold Your judgments my grave lords
Must give this cur the lie and his own notion
Who wears my stripes impressd upon him that
Must bear my beating to his graveshall join
To thrust the lie unto him
Peace both and hear me speak
Cut me to pieces Volsces men and lads
Stain all your edges on me Boy false hound
If you have writ your annals true tis there
That like an eagle in a dovecote I
Flutterd your Volscians in Corioli
Alone I did it Boy
Why noble lords
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune
Which was your shame by this unholy braggart
Fore your own eyes and ears
Let him die fort
Tear him to pieces Do it presently He killd
my son My daughter He killed my cousin
Marcus He killed my father
Peace ho no outrage peace
The man is noble and his fame foldsin
This orb o the earth His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing Stand Aufidius
And trouble not the peace
O that I had him
With six Aufidiuses or more his tribe
To use my lawful sword
Insolent villain
Kill kill kill kill kill him
The Conspirators draw and kill CORIOLANUS AUFIDIUS stands on his body
Hold hold hold hold
My noble masters hear me speak
O Tullus
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep
Tread not upon him Masters all be quiet
Put up your swords
My lords when you shall knowas in this rage
Provoked by him you cannotthe great danger
Which this mans life did owe you youll rejoice
That he is thus cut off Please it your honours
To call me to your senate Ill deliver
Myself your loyal servant or endure
Your heaviest censure
Bear from hence his body
And mourn you for him let him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ever herald
Did follow to his urn
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame
Lets make the best of it
My rage is gone
And I am struck with sorrow Take him up
Help three o the chiefest soldiers Ill be one
Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully
Trail your steel pikes Though in this city he
Hath widowd and unchilded many a one
Which to this hour bewail the injury
Yet he shall have a noble memory Assist
Exeunt bearing the body of CORIOLANUS A dead march sounded
Enter two Gentlemen
You do not meet a man but frowns our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Still seem as does the king
But whats the matter
His daughter and the heir ofs kingdom whom
He purposed to his wifes sole sona widow
That late he marriedhath referrd herself
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman shes wedded
Her husband banishd she imprisond all
Is outward sorrow though I think the king
Be touchd at very heart
None but the king
He that hath lost her too so is the queen
That most desired the match but not a courtier
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Of the kings looks hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowl at
And why so
He that hath missd the princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report and he that hath her
I mean that married her alack good man
And therefore banishdis a creature such
As to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like there would be something failing
In him that should compare I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he
You speak him far
I do extend him sir within himself
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly
Whats his name and birth
I cannot delve him to the root his father
Was calld Sicilius who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan
But had his titles by Tenantius whom
He served with glory and admired success
So gaind the suraddition Leonatus
And had besides this gentleman in question
Two other sons who in the wars o the time
Died with their swords in hand for which
their father
Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
That he quit being and his gentle lady
Big of this gentleman our theme deceased
As he was born The king he takes the babe
To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus
Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of which he took
As we do air fast as twas ministerd
And ins spring became a harvest lived in court
Which rare it is to domost praised most loved
A sample to the youngest to the more mature
A glass that feated them and to the graver
A child that guided dotards to his mistress
For whom he now is banishd her own price
Proclaims how she esteemd him and his virtue
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is
I honour him
Even out of your report But pray you tell me
Is she sole child to the king
His only child
He had two sons if this be worth your hearing
Mark it the eldest of them at three years old
I the swathingclothes the other from their nursery
Were stoln and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went
How long is this ago
Some twenty years
That a kings children should be so conveyd
So slackly guarded and the search so slow
That could not trace them
Howsoeer tis strange
Or that the negligence may well be laughd at
Yet is it true sir
I do well believe you
We must forbear here comes the gentleman
The queen and princess
Exeunt
Enter the QUEEN POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IMOGEN
No be assured you shall not find me daughter

Evileyed unto you youre my prisoner but

So soon as I can win the offended king
I will be known your advocate marry yet
The fire of rage is in him and twere good
You leand unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you

You know the peril
Ill fetch a turn about the garden pitying
The pangs of barrd affections though the king
Hath charged you should not speak together
Exit
O
Dissembling courtesy How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds My dearest husband
I something fear my fathers wrath but nothing
Always reserved my holy dutywhat
His rage can do on me you must be gone
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes not comforted to live
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again
My queen my mistress
O lady weep no more lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man I will remain
The loyalst husband that did eer plight troth
My residence in Rome at one Philarios
Who to my father was a friend to me
Known but by letter thither write my queen
And with mine eyes Ill drink the words you send
Though ink be made of gall
Reenter QUEEN
Be brief I pray you
If the king come I shall incur I know not
How much of his displeasure
Aside
Yet Ill move him
To walk this way I never do him wrong
But he does buy my injuries to be friends
Pays dear for my offences
Exit
Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live
The loathness to depart would grow Adieu
Nay stay a little
Were you but riding forth to air yourself
Such parting were too petty Look here love
This diamond was my mothers take it heart
But keep it till you woo another wife
When Imogen is dead
How how another
You gentle gods give me but this I have
And sear up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death
Putting on the ring
Remain remain thou here
While sense can keep it on And sweetest fairest
As I my poor self did exchange for you
To your so infinite loss so in our trifles

Enter CYMBELINE and Lords

With thy unworthiness thou diest away
Thourt poison to my blood
The gods protect you

Exit
There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is
O disloyal thing
That shouldst repair my youth thou heapst
A years age on me
I beseech you sir
Harm not yourself with your vexation
I am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs all fears
Past grace obedience
Past hope and in despair that way past grace
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen
O blest that I might not I chose an eagle
And did avoid a puttock
Thou tookst a beggar wouldst have made my throne
A seat for baseness
No I rather added
A lustre to it
O thou vile one
Sir
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus
You bred him as my playfellow and he is
A man worth any woman overbuys me
Almost the sum he pays
What art thou mad
Almost sir heaven restore me Would I were
A neatherds daughter and my Leonatus
Our neighbour shepherds son
Thou foolish thing
Reenter QUEEN
They were again together you have done
Not after our command Away with her
And pen her up
Beseech your patience Peace
Dear lady daughter peace Sweet sovereign

Out of your best advice
Nay let her languish
A drop of blood a day and being aged
Die of this folly
Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords
Fie you must give way
Enter PISANIO
Here is your servant How now sir What news
My lord your son drew on my master
Ha
No harm I trust is done
There might have been
But that my master rather playd than fought
And had no help of anger they were parted
By gentlemen at hand
I am very glad ont
Your sons my fathers friend he takes his part
To draw upon an exile O brave sir
I would they were in Afric both together
Myself by with a needle that I might prick
The goerback Why came you from your master
On his command he would not suffer me
To bring him to the haven left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to
When t pleased you to employ me
This hath been
Your faithful servant I dare lay mine honour
He will remain so
I humbly thank your highness
Pray walk awhile
About some halfhour hence

Go see my lord aboard for this time leave me
Exeunt
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
Sir I would advise you to shift a shirt the
sacrifice where air comes out air comes in
theres none abroad so wholesome as that you vent
If my shirt were bloody then to shift it Have I hurt him
Aside  No faith not so much as his patience
Hurt him his bodys a passable carcass if he be
not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel if it be not hurt
Aside  His steel was in debt it went o the
backside the town
The villain would not stand me
Aside  No but he fled forward still toward your face
Stand you You have land enough of your own but
he added to your having gave you some ground
Aside  As many inches as you have oceans Puppies
I would they had not come between us
Aside  So would I till you had measured how long
a fool you were upon the ground
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me
Aside  If it be a sin to make a true election she
is damned
Sir as I told you always her beauty and her brain
go not together shes a good sign but I have seen
small reflection of her wit
Aside  She shines not upon fools lest the
reflection should hurt her
Come Ill to my chamber Would there had been some
hurt done
Aside  I wish not so unless it had been the fall
of an ass which is no great hurt
Youll go with us
Ill attend your lordship
Nay come lets go together
Well my lord
Exeunt
Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
I would thou grewst unto the shores o the haven
And questiondst every sail if he should write
And not have it twere a paper lost
As offerd mercy is What was the last
That he spake to thee
It was his queen his queen
Then waved his handkerchief
And kissd it madam
Senseless Linen happier therein than I
And that was all
No madam for so long
As he could make me with this eye or ear
Distinguish him from others he did keep
The deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
Still waving as the fits and stirs of s mind
Could best express how slow his soul saild on
How swift his ship
Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow or less ere left
To aftereye him
Madam so I did
I would have broke mine eyestrings crackd them but
To look upon him till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
Nay followd him till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air and then
Have turnd mine eye and wept But good Pisanio
When shall we hear from him
Be assured madam
With his next vantage
I did not take my leave of him but had
Most pretty things to say ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear
The shes of Italy should not betray
Mine interest and his honour or have charged him
At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
To encounter me with orisons for then
I am in heaven for him or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words comes in my father
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing
Enter a Lady
The queen madam
Desires your highness company
Those things I bid you do get them dispatchd
I will attend the queen
Madam I shall
Exeunt
Enter PHILARIO IACHIMO a Frenchman a Dutchman and a Spaniard
Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain he was
then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy
as since he hath been allowed the name of but I
could then have looked on him without the help of
admiration though the catalogue of his endowments
had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
he is with that which makes him both without and within
I have seen him in France we had very many there
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
This matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own
words him I doubt not a great deal from the matter
And then his banishment
Ay and the approbation of those that weep this
lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment
which else an easy battery might lay flat for
taking a beggar without less quality But how comes
it he is to sojourn with you How creeps
acquaintance
His father and I were soldiers together to whom I
have been often bound for no less than my life
Here comes the Briton let him be so entertained
amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your
knowing to a stranger of his quality
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
I beseech you all be better known to this
gentleman whom I commend to you as a noble friend
of mine how worthy he is I will leave to appear
hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing
Sir we have known together in Orleans
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still
Sir you oerrate my poor kindness I was glad I
did atone my countryman and you it had been pity
you should have been put together with so mortal a
purpose as then each bore upon importance of so
slight and trivial a nature
By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller
rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
but upon my mended judgmentif I offend not to say
it is mendedmy quarrel was not altogether slight
Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords
and by such two that would by all likelihood have
confounded one the other or have fallen both
Can we with manners ask what was the difference
Safely I think twas a contention in public
which may without contradiction suffer the report
It was much like an argument that fell out last
night where each of us fell in praise of our
country mistresses this gentleman at that time
vouchingand upon warrant of bloody
affirmationhis to be more fair virtuous wise
chaste constantqualified and less attemptable
than any the rarest of our ladies in France
That lady is not now living or this gentlemans
opinion by this worn out
She holds her virtue still and I my mind
You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy
Being so far provoked as I was in France I would
abate her nothing though I profess myself her
adorer not her friend
As fair and as gooda kind of handinhand
comparisonhad been something too fair and too good
for any lady in Britain If she went before others
I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres
many I have beheld I could not but believe she
excelled many but I have not seen the most
precious diamond that is nor you the lady
I praised her as I rated her so do I my stone
What do you esteem it at
More than the world enjoys
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead or shes
outprized by a trifle
You are mistaken the one may be sold or given if
there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit
for the gift the other is not a thing for sale
and only the gift of the gods
Which the gods have given you
Which by their graces I will keep
You may wear her in title yours but you know
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds Your
ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable
estimations the one is but frail and the other
casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished
courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last
Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
to convince the honour of my mistress if in the
holding or loss of that you term her frail I do
nothing doubt you have store of thieves
notwithstanding I fear not my ring
Let us leave here gentlemen
Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I
thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
With five times so much conversation I should get
ground of your fair mistress make her go back even
to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friend
No no
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
your ring which in my opinion oervalues it
something but I make my wager rather against your
confidence than her reputation and to bar your
offence herein too I durst attempt it against any
lady in the world
You are a great deal abused in too bold a
persuasion and I doubt not you sustain what youre
worthy of by your attempt
Whats that
A repulse though your attempt as you call it
deserve more a punishment too
Gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly
let it die as it was born and I pray you be
better acquainted
Would I had put my estate and my neighbours on the
approbation of what I have spoke
What lady would you choose to assail
Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring
that commend me to the court where your lady is
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
second conference and I will bring from thence
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved
I will wage against your gold gold to it my ring
I hold dear as my finger tis part of it
You are afraid and therein the wiser If you buy
ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot
preserve it from tainting but I see you have some
religion in you that you fear
This is but a custom in your tongue you bear a
graver purpose I hope
I am the master of my speeches and would undergo
whats spoken I swear
Will you I shall but lend my diamond till your
return let there be covenants drawn betweens my
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
unworthy thinking I dare you to this match heres my ring
I will have it no lay
By the gods it is one If I bring you no
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats
are yours so is your diamond too if I come off
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in
she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are
yours provided I have your commendation for my more
free entertainment
I embrace these conditions let us have articles
betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer if
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
to understand you have prevailed I am no further
your enemy she is not worth our debate if she
remain unseduced you not making it appear
otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
your sword
Your hand a covenant we will have these things set
down by lawful counsel and straight away for
Britain lest the bargain should catch cold and
starve I will fetch my gold and have our two
wagers recorded
Agreed
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO
Will this hold think you
Signior Iachimo will not from it
Pray let us follow em
Exeunt
Enter QUEEN Ladies and CORNELIUS
Whiles yet the dews on ground gather those flowers
Make haste who has the note of them
I madam
Dispatch
Exeunt Ladies
Now master doctor have you brought those drugs
Pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam
Presenting a small box
But I beseech your grace without offence
My conscience bids me askwherefore you have
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds
Which are the movers of a languishing death
But though slow deadly
I wonder doctor
Thou askst me such a question Have I not been
Thy pupil long Hast thou not learnd me how
To make perfumes distil preserve yea so
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
For my confections Having thus far proceeded
Unless thou thinkst me devilishist not meet
That I did amplify my judgment in
Other conclusions I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hanging but none human
To try the vigour of them and apply
Their several virtues and effects
Your highness
Besides the seeing these effects will be
Both noisome and infectious
O content thee
Enter PISANIO
Aside
Here comes a flattering rascal upon him
Will I first work hes for his master
An enemy to my son How now Pisanio
Doctor your service for this time is ended
Take your own way
Aside          I do suspect you madam
But you shall do no harm
To PISANIO            Hark thee a word
Aside  I do not like her She doth think she has
Strange lingering poisons I do know her spirit
And will not trust one of her malice with
A drug of such damnd nature Those she has
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
Which first perchance shell prove on
cats and dogs
Then afterward up higher but there is
No danger in what show of death it makes
More than the lockingup the spirits a time
To be more fresh reviving She is foold
With a most false effect and I the truer
So to be false with her
No further service doctor
Until I send for thee
I humbly take my leave
Exit
Weeps she still sayst thou Dost thou think in time
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses Do thou work
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
Ill tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy master greater for
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
Is at last gasp return he cannot nor
Continue where he is to shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another
And every day that comes comes to decay
A days work in him What shalt thou expect
To be depender on a thing that leans
Who cannot be new built nor has no friends
So much as but to prop him
The QUEEN drops the box PISANIO takes it up
Thou takest up
Thou knowst not what but take it for thy labour
It is a thing I made which hath the king
Five times redeemd from death I do not know
What is more cordial Nay I prethee take it
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her dot as from thyself
Think what a chance thou changest on but think
Thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
Who shall take notice of thee Ill move the king
To any shape of thy preferment such
As thoult desire and then myself I chiefly
That set thee on to this desert am bound
To load thy merit richly Call my women
Think on my words
Exit PISANIO
A sly and constant knave
Not to be shaked the agent for his master
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The handfast to her lord I have given him that
Which if he take shall quite unpeople her
Of liegers for her sweet and which she after
Except she bend her humour shall be assured
To taste of too
Reenter PISANIO and Ladies
So so well done well done
The violets cowslips and the primroses
Bear to my closet Fare thee well Pisanio
Think on my words
Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies
And shall do
But when to my good lord I prove untrue
Ill choke myself theres all Ill do for you
Exit
Enter IMOGEN
A father cruel and a stepdame false
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady

Vexations of it Had I been thiefstoln

How mean soeer that have their honest wills

Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO
Madam a noble gentleman of Rome
Comes from my lord with letters
Change you madam
The worthy Leonatus is in safety
And greets your highness dearly
Presents a letter
Thanks good sir
Youre kindly welcome
Aside  All of her that is out of door most rich
If she be furnishd with a mind so rare
She is alone the Arabian bird and I
Have lost the wager Boldness be my friend
Arm me audacity from head to foot
Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight
Rather directly fly
Reads  He is one of the noblest note to whose
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied Reflect upon
him accordingly as you value your trust
LEONATUS
So far I read aloud
But even the very middle of my heart
Is warmd by the rest and takes it thankfully
You are as welcome worthy sir as I
Have words to bid you and shall find it so
In all that I can do
Thanks fairest lady
What are men mad Hath nature given them eyes
To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
Of sea and land which can distinguish twixt
The fiery orbs above and the twinnd stones
Upon the numberd beach and can we not
Partition make with spectacles so precious
Twixt fair and foul
What makes your admiration
It cannot be i the eye for apes and monkeys
Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
Contemn with mows the other nor i the judgment
For idiots in this case of favour would
Be wisely definite nor i the appetite
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
Should make desire vomit emptiness
Not so allured to feed
What is the matter trow
The cloyed will
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
Both filld and running ravening first the lamb
Longs after for the garbage
What dear sir
Thus raps you Are you well
Thanks madam well
To PISANIO
Beseech you sir desire
My mans abode where I did leave him he
Is strange and peevish
I was going sir
To give him welcome
Exit
Continues well my lord His health beseech you
Well madam
Is he disposed to mirth I hope he is
Exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
So merry and so gamesome he is calld
The Briton reveller
When he was here
He did incline to sadness and ofttimes
Not knowing why
I never saw him sad
There is a Frenchman his companion one
An eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
A Gallian girl at home he furnaces
The thick sighs from him whiles the jolly Briton
Your lord I meanlaughs froms free lungs cries O
Can my sides hold to think that man who knows
By history report or his own proof
What woman is yea what she cannot choose
But must be will his free hours languish for
Assured bondage
Will my lord say so
Ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
It is a recreation to be by
And hear him mock the Frenchman But heavens know
Some men are much to blame
Not he I hope
Not he but yet heavens bounty towards him might
Be used more thankfully In himself tis much
In you which I account his beyond all talents
Whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound
To pity too
What do you pity sir
Two creatures heartily
Am I one sir
You look on me what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity
Lamentable What
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
I the dungeon by a snuff
I pray you sir
Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands Why do you pity me
That others do
I was about to sayenjoy yourBut
It is an office of the gods to venge it
Not mine to speak on t
You do seem to know
Something of me or what concerns me pray you
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do for certainties
Either are past remedies or timely knowing
The remedy then borndiscover to me
What both you spur and stop
Had I this cheek
To bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
Whose every touch would force the feelers soul
To the oath of loyalty this object which
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
Fixing it only here should I damnd then
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
That mount the Capitol join gripes with hands
Made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as
With labour then bypeeping in an eye
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
Thats fed with stinking tallow it were fit
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
Encounter such revolt
My lord I fear
Has forgot Britain
And himself Not I
Inclined to this intelligence pronounce
The beggary of his change but tis your graces
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out
Let me hear no more
O dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
With pity that doth make me sick A lady
So fair and fastend to an empery
Would make the greatst king doubleto be partnerd
With tomboys hired with that selfexhibition
Which your own coffers yield with diseased ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend nature such boild stuff
As well might poison poison Be revenged
Or she that bore you was no queen and you
Recoil from your great stock
Revenged
How should I be revenged If this be true
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuseif it be true
How should I be revenged
Should he make me
Live like Dianas priest betwixt cold sheets
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
In your despite upon your purse Revenge it
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
More noble than that runagate to your bed
And will continue fast to your affection
Still close as sure
What ho Pisanio
Let me my service tender on your lips
Away I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee If thou wert honourable
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
For such an end thou seekstas base as strange
Thou wrongst a gentleman who is as far
From thy report as thou from honour and
Solicitst here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike What ho Pisanio
The king my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault if he shall think it fit
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us he hath a court
He little cares for and a daughter who
He not respects at all What ho Pisanio
O happy Leonatus I may say
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
Her assured credit Blessed live you long
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Country calld his and you his mistress only
For the most worthiest fit Give me your pardon
I have spoke this to know if your affiance
Were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
That which he is new oer and he is one
The truest mannerd such a holy witch
That he enchants societies into him
Half all mens hearts are his
You make amends
He sits mongst men like a descended god
He hath a kind of honour sets him off
More than a mortal seeming Be not angry
Most mighty princess that I have adventured
To try your taking a false report which hath
Honourd with confirmation your great judgment
In the election of a sir so rare
Which you know cannot err the love I bear him
Made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
Unlike all others chaffless Pray your pardon
Alls well sir take my power i the court
for yours
My humble thanks I had almost forgot
To entreat your grace but in a small request
And yet of moment to for it concerns
Your lord myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business
Pray what ist
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord
The best feather of our winghave mingled sums
To buy a present for the emperor
In France tis plate of rare device and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form their values great
And I am something curious being strange
To have them in safe stowage may it please you
To take them in protection
Willingly
And pawn mine honour for their safety since
My lord hath interest in them I will keep them
In my bedchamber
They are in a trunk
Attended by my men I will make bold
To send them to you only for this night
I must aboard tomorrow
O no no
Yes I beseech or I shall short my word
By lengthening my return From Gallia
I crossd the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your grace
I thank you for your pains
But not away tomorrow
O I must madam
Therefore I shall beseech you if you please
To greet your lord with writing dot tonight
I have outstood my time which is material
To the tender of our present
I will write
Send your trunk to me it shall safe be kept
And truly yielded you Youre very welcome
Exeunt
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
Was there ever man had such luck when I kissed the
jack upon an upcast to be hit away I had a
hundred pound ont and then a whoreson jackanapes
must take me up for swearing as if I borrowed mine
oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure
What got he by that You have broke his pate with
your bowl
Aside  If his wit had been like him that broke it
it would have run all out
When a gentleman is disposed to swear it is not for
any standersby to curtail his oaths ha
No my lord
Aside
nor crop the ears of them
Would he had been one of my rank
Aside  To have smelt like a fool
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth a
pox ont I had rather not be so noble as I am
they dare not fight with me because of the queen my
mother every Jackslave hath his bellyful of
fighting and I must go up and down like a cock that
nobody can match
Aside  You are cock and capon too and you crow
cock with your comb on
Sayest thou
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
companion that you give offence to
No I know that but it is fit I should commit
offence to my inferiors
Ay it is fit for your lordship only
Why so I say
Did you hear of a stranger thats come to court tonight
A stranger and I not know ont
Aside  Hes a strange fellow himself and knows it

Theres an Italian come and tis thought one of
Leonatus friends
Leonatus a banished rascal and hes another
whatsoever he be Who told you of this stranger
One of your lordships pages
Is it fit I went to look upon him is there no
derogation int
You cannot derogate my lord
Not easily I think
Aside  You are a fool granted therefore your
issues being foolish do not derogate
Come Ill go see this Italian what I have lost
today at bowls Ill win tonight of him Come go
Ill attend your lordship
Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord
That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass a woman that
Bears all down with her brain and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty for his heart
And leave eighteen Alas poor princess
Thou divine Imogen what thou endurest
Betwixt a father by thy stepdame governd
A mother hourly coining plots a wooer
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of the divorce held make The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honour keep unshaked
That temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand
To enjoy thy banishd lord and this great land
Exit
a trunk in one corner of it
IMOGEN in bed reading a Lady attending
Whos there my woman Helen
Please you madam
What hour is it
Almost midnight madam
I have read three hours then mine eyes are weak
Fold down the leaf where I have left to bed
Take not away the taper leave it burning
And if thou canst awake by four o the clock
I prithee call me Sleep hath seized me wholly
Exit Lady
To your protection I commend me gods
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me beseech ye
Sleeps IACHIMO comes from the trunk
The crickets sing and mans oerlabourd sense
Repairs itself by rest Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes ere he wakend
The chastity he wounded Cytherea
How bravely thou becomest thy bed fresh lily
And whiter than the sheets That I might touch
But kiss one kiss Rubies unparagond
How dearly they dot Tis her breathing that
Perfumes the chamber thus the flame o the taper
Bows toward her and would underpeep her lids
To see the enclosed lights now canopied
Under these windows white and azure laced
With blue of heavens own tinct But my design
To note the chamber I will write all down
Such and such pictures there the window such
The adornment of her bed the arras figures
Why such and such and the contents o the story
Ah but some natural notes about her body
Above ten thousand meaner moveables
Would testify to enrich mine inventory
O sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
And be her sense but as a monument
Thus in a chapel lying Come off come off
Taking off her bracelet
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard
Tis mine and this will witness outwardly
As strongly as the conscience does within
To the madding of her lord On her left breast
A mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops
I the bottom of a cowslip heres a voucher
Stronger than ever law could make this secret
Will force him think I have pickd the lock and taen
The treasure of her honour No more To what end
Why should I write this down thats riveted
Screwd to my memory She hath been reading late
The tale of Tereus here the leafs turnd down
Where Philomel gave up I have enough
To the trunk again and shut the spring of it
Swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning
May bare the ravens eye I lodge in fear
Though this a heavenly angel hell is here
Clock strikes
One two three time time
An antechamber adjoining Imogens apartments
Enter CLOTEN and Lords
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss the
most coldest that ever turned up ace
It would make any man cold to lose
But not every man patient after the noble temper of
your lordship You are most hot and furious when you win
Winning will put any man into courage If I could
get this foolish Imogen I should have gold enough
Its almost morning ist not
Day my lord
I would this music would come I am advised to give
her music o mornings they say it will penetrate
Enter Musicians
Come on tune if you can penetrate her with your
fingering so well try with tongue too if none
will do let her remain but Ill never give oer
First a very excellent goodconceited thing
after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich
words to it and then let her consider
SONG
Hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings
And Phoebus gins arise
His steeds to water at those springs
On chaliced flowers that lies
And winking Marybuds begin
To ope their golden eyes
With every thing that pretty is
My lady sweet arise
Arise arise
So get you gone If this penetrate I will
consider your music the better if it do not it is
a vice in her ears which horsehairs and
calvesguts nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
boot can never amend
Exeunt Musicians
Here comes the king
I am glad I was up so late for thats the reason I
was up so early he cannot choose but take this
service I have done fatherly
Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter
Will she not forth
I have assailed her with music but she vouchsafes no notice
The exile of her minion is too new
She hath not yet forgot him some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance out
And then shes yours
You are most bound to the king
Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting and be friended
With aptness of the season make denials
Increase your services so seem as if
You were inspired to do those duties which
You tender to her that you in all obey her
Save when command to your dismission tends
And therein you are senseless
Senseless not so
Enter a Messenger
So like you sir ambassadors from Rome
The one is Caius Lucius
A worthy fellow
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now
But thats no fault of his we must receive him
According to the honour of his sender
And towards himself his goodness forespent on us
We must extend our notice Our dear son
When you have given good morning to your mistress
Attend the queen and us we shall have need
To employ you towards this Roman Come our queen
Exeunt all but CLOTEN
If she be up Ill speak with her if not
Let her lie still and dream
Knocks
By your leave ho
I Know her women are about her what
If I do line one of their hands Tis gold
Which buys admittance oft it doth yea and makes
Dianas rangers false themselves yield up
Their deer to the stand o the stealer and tis gold
Which makes the true man killd and saves the thief
Nay sometime hangs both thief and true man what
Can it not do and undo I will make
One of her women lawyer to me for
I yet not understand the case myself
Knocks
By your leave
Enter a Lady
Whos there that knocks
A gentleman
No more
Yes and a gentlewomans son
Thats more
Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
Can justly boast of Whats your lordships pleasure

Ay
To keep her chamber
There is gold for you
Sell me your good report
How my good name or to report of you
What I shall think is goodThe princess
Enter IMOGEN
Good morrow fairest sister your sweet hand
Exit Lady
Good morrow sir You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble the thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
And scarce can spare them
Still I swear I love you
If you but said so twere as deep with me
If you swear still your recompense is still
That I regard it not
This is no answer
But that you shall not say I yield being silent
I would not speak I pray you spare me faith
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness one of your great knowing
Should learn being taught forbearance
To leave you in your madness twere my sin
I will not
Fools are not mad folks
Do you call me fool
As I am mad I do
If youll be patient Ill no more be mad
That cures us both I am much sorry sir
You put me to forget a ladys manners
By being so verbal and learn now for all
That I which know my heart do here pronounce
By the very truth of it I care not for you
And am so near the lack of charity
To accuse myselfI hate you which I had rather
You felt than maket my boast
You sin against
Obedience which you owe your father For
One bred of alms and fosterd with cold dishes
And though it be allowd in meaner parties
Yet who than he more meanto knit their souls
On whom there is no more dependency
But brats and beggary in selffigured knot
Yet you are curbd from that enlargement by
The consequence o the crown and must not soil
The precious note of it with a base slave
A hilding for a livery a squires cloth
A pantler not so eminent
Profane fellow
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides thou wert too base
To be his groom thou wert dignified enough
Even to the point of envy if twere made
Comparative for your virtues to be styled
The underhangman of his kingdom and hated
For being preferred so well
The southfog rot him
He never can meet more mischance than come
To be but named of thee His meanest garment
That ever hath but clippd his body is dearer
In my respect than all the hairs above thee
Were they all made such men How now Pisanio
Enter PISANIO
His garment Now the devil
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently
His garment
I am sprited with a fool
Frighted and angerd worse go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm it was thy masters shrew me
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any kings in Europe I do think
I sawt this morning confident I am
Last night twas on mine arm I kissd it
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he
Twill not be lost
I hope so go and search
Exit PISANIO
You have abused me
His meanest garment
Ay I said so sir
I will inform your father
Your mother too
Shes my good lady and will conceive I hope
But the worst of me So I leave you sir
To the worst of discontent
Exit
Ill be revenged
His meanest garment Well
Exit
CYMBELINE
Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO
Fear it not sir I would I were so sure
To win the king as I am bold her honour
Will remain hers
What means do you make to him
Not any but abide the change of time
Quake in the present winters state and wish
That warmer days would come in these seard hopes
I barely gratify your love they failing
I must die much your debtor
Your very goodness and your company
Oerpays all I can do By this your king
Hath heard of great Augustus Caius Lucius
Will dos commission throughly and I think
Hell grant the tribute send the arrearages
Or look upon our Romans whose remembrance
Is yet fresh in their grief
I do believe
Statist though I am none nor like to be
That this will prove a war and you shall hear
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
In our notfearing Britain than have tidings
Of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen
Are men more orderd than when Julius Caesar
Smiled at their lack of skill but found
their courage
Worthy his frowning at their discipline
Now mingled with their courages will make known
To their approvers they are people such
That mend upon the world
Enter IACHIMO
See Iachimo
The swiftest harts have posted you by land
And winds of all the comers kissd your sails
To make your vessel nimble
Welcome sir
I hope the briefness of your answer made
The speediness of your return
Your lady
Is one of the fairest that I have lookd upon
And therewithal the best or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
And be false with them
Here are letters for you
Their tenor good I trust
Tis very like
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there
He was expected then
But not approachd
All is well yet
Sparkles this stone as it was wont or ist not
Too dull for your good wearing
If I had lost it
I should have lost the worth of it in gold
Ill make a journey twice as far to enjoy
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain for the ring is won
The stones too hard to come by
Not a whit
Your lady being so easy
Make not sir
Your loss your sport I hope you know that we
Must not continue friends
Good sir we must
If you keep covenant Had I not brought
The knowledge of your mistress home I grant
We were to question further but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honour
Together with your ring and not the wronger
Of her or you having proceeded but
By both your wills
If you can maket apparent
That you have tasted her in bed my hand
And ring is yours if not the foul opinion
You had of her pure honour gains or loses
Your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
To who shall find them
Sir my circumstances
Being so near the truth as I will make them
Must first induce you to believe whose strength
I will confirm with oath which I doubt not
Youll give me leave to spare when you shall find
You need it not
Proceed
First her bedchamber
Where I confess I slept not but profess
Had that was well worth watchingit was hangd
With tapesty of silk and silver the story
Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
And Cydnus swelld above the banks or for
The press of boats or pride a piece of work
So bravely done so rich that it did strive
In workmanship and value which I wonderd
Since the true life ont was
This is true
And this you might have heard of here by me
Or by some other
More particulars
Must justify my knowledge
So they must
Or do your honour injury
The chimney
Is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
Chaste Dian bathing never saw I figures
So likely to report themselves the cutter
Was as another nature dumb outwent her
Motion and breath left out
This is a thing
Which you might from relation likewise reap
Being as it is much spoke of
The roof o the chamber
With golden cherubins is fretted her andirons
I had forgot themwere two winking Cupids
Of silver each on one foot standing nicely
Depending on their brands
This is her honour
Let it be granted you have seen all thisand praise
Be given to your remembrancethe description
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
The wager you have laid
Then if you can
Showing the bracelet
Be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel see
And now tis up again it must be married
To that your diamond Ill keep them
Jove
Once more let me behold it is it that
Which I left with her
SirI thank herthat
She strippd it from her arm I see her yet
And yet enrichd it too she gave it me and said
She prized it once
May be she pluckd it off
To send it me
She writes so to you doth she
O no no no tis true Here take this too
Gives the ring
It is a basilisk unto mine eye
Kills me to look ont Let there be no honour
Where there is beauty truth where semblance love
Where theres another man the vows of women
Of no more bondage be to where they are made
Than they are to their virtues which is nothing
O above measure false
Have patience sir
And take your ring again tis not yet won
It may be probable she lost it or
Who knows if one of her women being corrupted
Hath stoln it from her
Very true
And so I hope he came byt Back my ring
Render to me some corporal sign about her
More evident than this for this was stolen
By Jupiter I had it from her arm
Hark you he swears by Jupiter he swears
Tis truenay keep the ringtis true I am sure
She would not lose it her attendants are
All sworn and honourablethey induced to steal it
And by a strangerNo he hath enjoyed her
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this she hath bought the name of whore
thus dearly
There take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you
Sir be patient
This is not strong enough to be believed
Of one persuaded well of
Never talk ont
She hath been colted by him
If you seek
For further satisfying under her breast
Worthy the pressinglies a mole right proud
Of that most delicate lodging by my life
I kissd it and it gave me present hunger
To feed again though full You do remember
This stain upon her
Ay and it doth confirm
Another stain as big as hell can hold
Were there no more but it
Will you hear more
Spare your arithmetic never count the turns
Once and a million
Ill be sworn
No swearing
If you will swear you have not donet you lie
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
Thoust made me cuckold
Ill deny nothing
O that I had her here to tear her limbmeal
I will go there and dot i the court before
Her father Ill do something
Exit
Quite besides
The government of patience You have won
Lets follow him and pervert the present wrath
He hath against himself
With an my heart
Exeunt
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Is there no way for men to be but women
Must be halfworkers We are all bastards
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father was I know not where
When I was stampd some coiner with his tools
Made me a counterfeit yet my mother seemd
The Dian of that time so doth my wife
The nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance
Me of my lawful pleasure she restraind
And prayd me oft forbearance did it with
A pudency so rosy the sweet view ont
Might well have warmd old Saturn that I thought her
As chaste as unsunnd snow O all the devils
This yellow Iachimo in an hourwast not
Or lessat firstperchance he spoke not but
Like a fullacornd boar a German one
Cried O and mounted found no opposition
But what he lookd for should oppose and she
Should from encounter guard Could I find out
The womans part in me For theres no motion
That tends to vice in man but I affirm
It is the womans part be it lying note it
The womans flattering hers deceiving hers
Lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
Nice longing slanders mutability
All faults that may be named nay that hell knows
Why hers in part or all but rather all
For even to vice
They are not constant but are changing still
One vice but of a minute old for one
Not half so old as that Ill write against them
Detest them curse them yet tis greater skill
In a true hate to pray they have their will
The very devils cannot plague them better
Exit
Enter in state CYMBELINE QUEEN CLOTEN  and Lords at one door and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants
Now say what would Augustus Caesar with us
When Julius Caesar whose remembrance yet
Lives in mens eyes and will to ears and tongues
Be theme and hearing ever was in this Britain
And conquerd it Cassibelan thine uncle
Famous in Caesars praises no whit less
Than in his feats deserving itfor him
And his succession granted Rome a tribute
Yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
Is left untenderd
And to kill the marvel
Shall be so ever
There be many Caesars
Ere such another Julius Britain is
A world by itself and we will nothing pay
For wearing our own noses
That opportunity
Which then they had to take from s to resume
We have again Remember sir my liege
The kings your ancestors together with
The natural bravery of your isle which stands
As Neptunes park ribbed and paled in
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters
With sands that will not bear your enemies boats
But suck them up to the topmast A kind of conquest
Caesar made here but made not here his brag
Of Came and saw and overcame  with shame
That first that ever touchd himhe was carried
From off our coast twice beaten and his shipping
Poor ignorant baubles upon our terrible seas
Like eggshells moved upon their surges crackd
As easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof
The famed Cassibelan who was once at point
O giglot fortuneto master Caesars sword
Made Luds town with rejoicing fires bright
And Britons strut with courage
Come theres no more tribute to be paid our
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and
as I said there is no moe such Caesars other of
them may have crookd noses but to owe such
straight arms none
Son let your mother end
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
Cassibelan I do not say I am one but I have a
hand Why tribute why should we pay tribute If
Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or
put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute
for light else sir no more tribute pray you now
You must know
Till the injurious Romans did extort
This tribute from us we were free
Caesars ambition
Which swelld so much that it did almost stretch
The sides o the world against all colour here
Did put the yoke upon s which to shake off
Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
Ourselves to be
We do
Say then to Caesar
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
Ordaind our laws whose use the sword of Caesar
Hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
Shall by the power we hold be our good deed
Though Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our laws
Who was the first of Britain which did put
His brows within a golden crown and calld
Himself a king
I am sorry Cymbeline
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar
Caesar that hath more kings his servants than
Thyself domestic officersthine enemy
Receive it from me then war and confusion
In Caesars name pronounce I gainst thee look
For fury not to be resisted Thus defied
I thank thee for myself
Thou art welcome Caius
Thy Caesar knighted me my youth I spent
Much under him of him I gatherd honour
Which he to seek of me again perforce
Behoves me keep at utterance I am perfect
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their liberties are now in arms a precedent
Which not to read would show the Britons cold
So Caesar shall not find them
Let proof speak
His majesty bids you welcome Make
pastime with us a day or two or longer if
you seek us afterwards in other terms you
shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you
beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in
the adventure our crows shall fare the better
for you and theres an end
So sir
I know your masters pleasure and he mine
All the remain is Welcome
Exeunt
Enter PISANIO with a letter
How of adultery Wherefore write you not
What monsters her accuser Leonatus
O master what a strange infection
Is falln into thy ear What false Italian
As poisonoustongued as handed hath prevaild
On thy too ready hearing Disloyal No
Shes punishd for her truth and undergoes
More goddesslike than wifelike such assaults
As would take in some virtue O my master
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes How that I should murder her
Upon the love and truth and vows which I
Have made to thy command I her her blood
If it be so to do good service never
Let me be counted serviceable How look I
That I should seem to lack humanity
Reading
Dot the letter
that I have sent her by her own command
Shall give thee opportunity O damnd paper
Black as the ink thats on thee Senseless bauble
So virginlike without Lo here she comes
I am ignorant in what I am commanded
Enter IMOGEN
How now Pisanio
Madam here is a letter from my lord
Who thy lord that is my lord Leonatus
O learnd indeed were that astronomer
Held lay the future open You good gods
Let what is here containd relish of love
Of my lords health of his content yet not
That we two are asunder let that grieve him
Some griefs are medcinable that is one of them
For it doth physic love of his content

LEONATUS POSTHUMUS
O for a horse with wings Hearst thou Pisanio
He is at MilfordHaven read and tell me
How far tis thither If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week why may not I
Glide thither in a day Then true Pisanio
Who longst like me to see thy lord who longst
let me batebut not like meyet longst
But in a fainter kindO not like me
For mines beyond beyondsay and speak thick
Loves counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
To the smothering of the sensehow far it is
To this same blessed Milford and by the way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
To inherit such a haven but first of all
How we may steal from hence and for the gap
That we shall make in time from our hencegoing
And our return to excuse but first how get hence
Why should excuse be born or eer begot
Well talk of that hereafter Prithee speak
How many score of miles may we well ride
Twixt hour and hour
One score twixt sun and sun
Madam s enough for you
Aside
and too much too
Why one that rode tos execution man
Could never go so slow I have heard of
riding wagers
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i the clocks behalf But this is foolery
Go bid my woman feign a sickness say
Shell home to her father and provide me presently
A ridingsuit no costlier than would fit
A franklins housewife
Madam youre best consider
I see before me man nor here nor here
Nor what ensues but have a fog in them
That I cannot look through Away I prithee
Do as I bid thee theres no more to say
Accessible is none but Milford way
Exeunt
Enter from the cave BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS following
A goodly day not to keep house with such
Whose roofs as low as ours Stoop boys this gate
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
To a mornings holy office the gates of monarchs
Are archd so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on without
Good morrow to the sun Hail thou fair heaven
We house i the rock yet use thee not so hardly
As prouder livers do
Hail heaven
Hail heaven
Now for our mountain sport up to yond hill
Your legs are young Ill tread these flats Consider
When you above perceive me like a crow
That it is place which lessens and sets off
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts of princes of the tricks in war
This service is not service so being done
But being so allowd to apprehend thus
Draws us a profit from all things we see
And often to our comfort shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the fullwingd eagle O this life
Is nobler than attending for a cheque
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble
Prouder than rustling in unpaidfor silk
Such gain the cap of him that makes em fine
Yet keeps his book uncrossd no life to ours
Out of your proof you speak we poor unfledged
Have never wingd from view o the nest nor know not
What airs from home Haply this life is best
If quiet life be best sweeter to you
That have a sharper known well corresponding
With your stiff age but unto us it is
A cell of ignorance travelling abed
A prison for a debtor that not dares
To stride a limit
What should we speak of
When we are old as you when we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December how
In this our pinching cave shall we discourse
The freezing hours away We have seen nothing
We are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
Our valour is to chase what flies our cage
We make a quire as doth the prisond bird
And sing our bondage freely
How you speak
Did you but know the citys usuries
And felt them knowingly the art o the court
As hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
Is certain falling or so slippery that
The fears as bad as falling the toil o the war
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
I the name of fame and honour which dies i
the search
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
Doth ill deserve by doing well whats worse
Must courtsy at the censureO boys this story
The world may read in me my bodys markd
With Roman swords and my report was once
First with the best of note Cymbeline loved me
And when a soldier was the theme my name
Was not far off then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
A storm or robbery call it what you will
Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
And left me bare to weather
Uncertain favour
My fault being nothingas I have told you oft
But that two villains whose false oaths prevaild
Before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans so
Followd my banishment and this twenty years
This rock and these demesnes have been my world
Where I have lived at honest freedom paid
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The foreend of my time But up to the mountains
This is not hunters language he that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o the feast
To him the other two shall minister
And we will fear no poison which attends
In place of greater state Ill meet you in the valleys
Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
These boys know little they are sons to the king
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive
They think they are mine and though traind
up thus meanly
I the cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit
The roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others This Polydore
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain who
The king his father calld GuideriusJove
When on my threefoot stool I sit and tell
The warlike feats I have done his spirits fly out
Into my story say Thus mine enemy fell
And thus I set my foot on s neck even then
The princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
Once Arviragus in as like a figure
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
His own conceivingHark the game is roused
O Cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
Thou didst unjustly banish me whereon
At three and two years old I stole these babes
Thinking to bar thee of succession as
Thou reftst me of my lands Euriphile
Thou wast their nurse they took thee for
their mother
And every day do honour to her grave
Myself Belarius that am Morgan calld
They take for natural father The game is up
Exit
Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN
Thou toldst me when we came from horse the place
Was near at hand neer longd my mother so
To see me first as I have now Pisanio man
Where is Posthumus What is in thy mind
That makes thee stare thus Wherefore breaks that sigh
From the inward of thee One but painted thus
Would be interpreted a thing perplexd
Beyond selfexplication put thyself
Into a havior of less fear ere wildness
Vanquish my staider senses Whats the matter
Why tenderst thou that paper to me with
A look untender Ift be summer news
Smile tot before if winterly thou needst
But keep that countenance still My husbands hand
That drugdamnd Italy hath outcraftied him
And hes at some hard point Speak man thy tongue
May take off some extremity which to read
Would be even mortal to me
Please you read
And you shall find me wretched man a thing
The most disdaind of fortune
Reads  Thy mistress Pisanio hath played the
strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie
bleeding in me I speak not out of weak surmises
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
as I expect my revenge That part thou Pisanio
the breach of hers Let thine own hands take away
her life I shall give thee opportunity at
MilfordHaven She hath my letter for the purpose
where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
equally to me disloyal
What shall I need to draw my sword the paper
Hath cut her throat already No tis slander
Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breath
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world kings queens and states
Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
This viperous slander enters What cheer madam
False to his bed What is it to be false
To lie in watch there and to think on him
To weep twixt clock and clock if sleep
charge nature
To break it with a fearful dream of him
And cry myself awake thats false tos bed is it
Alas good lady
I false Thy conscience witness Iachimo
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency
Thou then lookdst like a villain now methinks
Thy favours good enough Some jay of Italy
Whose mother was her painting hath betrayd him
Poor I am stale a garment out of fashion
And for I am richer than to hang by the walls
I must be rippdto pieces with meO
Mens vows are womens traitors All good seeming
By thy revolt O husband shall be thought
Put on for villany not born wheret grows
But worn a bait for ladies
Good madam hear me
True honest men being heard like false Aeneas
Were in his time thought false and Sinons weeping
Did scandal many a holy tear took pity
From most true wretchedness so thou Posthumus
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
From thy great fall Come fellow be thou honest
Do thou thy masters bidding when thou seest him
A little witness my obedience look
I draw the sword myself take it and hit
The innocent mansion of my love my heart
Fear not tis empty of all things but grief
Thy master is not there who was indeed
The riches of it do his bidding strike
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
But now thou seemst a coward
Hence vile instrument
Thou shalt not damn my hand
Why I must die
And if I do not by thy hand thou art
No servant of thy masters Against selfslaughter
There is a prohibition so divine
That cravens my weak hand Come heres my heart
Somethings aforet Soft soft well no defence
Obedient as the scabbard What is here
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
All turnd to heresy Away away
Corrupters of my faith you shall no more
Be stomachers to my heart Thus may poor fools
Believe false teachers though those that
are betrayd
Do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
Stands in worse case of woe
And thou Posthumus thou that didst set up
My disobedience gainst the king my father
And make me put into contempt the suits
Of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
A strain of rareness and I grieve myself
To think when thou shalt be disedged by her
That now thou tirest on how thy memory
Will then be pangd by me Prithee dispatch
The lamb entreats the butcher wheres thy knife
Thou art too slow to do thy masters bidding
When I desire it too
O gracious lady
Since I received command to do this business
I have not slept one wink
Dot and to bed then
Ill wake mine eyeballs blind first
Wherefore then
Didst undertake it Why hast thou abused
So many miles with a pretence this place
The time inviting thee the perturbd court
For my being absent whereunto I never
Purpose return Why hast thou gone so far
To be unbent when thou hast taen thy stand
The elected deer before thee
But to win time
To lose so bad employment in the which
I have considerd of a course Good lady
Hear me with patience
Talk thy tongue weary speak
I have heard I am a strumpet and mine ear
Therein false struck can take no greater wound
Nor tent to bottom that But speak
Then madam
I thought you would not back again
Most like
Bringing me here to kill me
Not so neither
But if I were as wise as honest then
My purpose would prove well It cannot be
But that my master is abused
Some villain ay and singular in his art
Hath done you both this cursed injury
Some Roman courtezan
No on my life
Ill give but notice you are dead and send him
Some bloody sign of it for tis commanded
I should do so you shall be missd at court
And that will well confirm it
Why good fellow
What shall I do the where where bide how live
Or in my life what comfort when I am
Dead to my husband
If youll back to the court
No court no father nor no more ado
With that harsh noble simple nothing
That Cloten whose lovesuit hath been to me
As fearful as a siege
If not at court
Then not in Britain must you bide
Where then
Hath Britain all the sun that shines Day night
Are they not but in Britain I the worlds volume
Our Britain seems as of it but not in t
In a great pool a swans nest prithee think
Theres livers out of Britain
I am most glad
You think of other place The ambassador
Lucius the Roman comes to MilfordHaven
Tomorrow now if you could wear a mind
Dark as your fortune is and but disguise
That which to appear itself must not yet be
But by selfdanger you should tread a course
Pretty and full of view yea haply near
The residence of Posthumus so nigh at least
Report should render him hourly to your ear
As truly as he moves
O for such means
Though peril to my modesty not death ont
I would adventure
Well then heres the point
You must forget to be a woman change
Command into obedience fear and niceness

Ready in gibes quickanswerd saucy and
As quarrelous as the weasel nay you must
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
Exposing itbut O the harder heart

You made great Juno angry

A man already

And with what imitation you can borrow

A princes courage Away I prithee
Well madam we must take a short farewell
Lest being missd I be suspected of

Exeunt severally
Enter CYMBELINE QUEEN CLOTEN LUCIUS Lords and Attendants
Thus far and so farewell
Thanks royal sir
My emperor hath wrote I must from hence
And am right sorry that I must report ye

Will not endure his yoke and for ourself
To show less sovereignty than they must needs
Appear unkinglike
So sir I desire of you
A conduct overland to MilfordHaven
Madam all joy befal your grace
And you
My lords you are appointed for that office
The due of honour in no point omit
So farewell noble Lucius
Your hand my lord
Receive it friendly but from this time forth
I wear it as your enemy
Sir the event
Is yet to name the winner fare you well
Leave not the worthy Lucius good my lords
Till he have crossd the Severn Happiness
Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords
He goes hence frowning but it honours us
That we have given him cause
Tis all the better
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
How it goes here It fits us therefore ripely
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness
The powers that he already hath in Gallia
Will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves
His war for Britain
Tis not sleepy business
But must be lookd to speedily and strongly
Our expectation that it would be thus
Hath made us forward But my gentle queen
Where is our daughter She hath not appeard
Before the Roman nor to us hath tenderd
The duty of the day she looks us like
A thing more made of malice than of duty
We have noted it Call her before us for
We have been too slight in sufferance
Exit an Attendant
Royal sir
Since the exile of Posthumus most retired
Hath her life been the cure whereof my lord
Tis time must do Beseech your majesty
Forbear sharp speeches to her shes a lady
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
And strokes death to her
Reenter Attendant
Where is she sir How
Can her contempt be answerd
Please you sir
Her chambers are all lockd and theres no answer
That will be given to the loudest noise we make
My lord when last I went to visit her
She prayd me to excuse her keeping close
Whereto constraind by her infirmity
She should that duty leave unpaid to you
Which daily she was bound to proffer this
She wishd me to make known but our great court
Made me to blame in memory
Her doors lockd
Not seen of late Grant heavens that which I fear
Prove false
Exit
Son I say follow the king
That man of hers Pisanio her old servant
have not seen these two days
Go look after
Exit CLOTEN
Pisanio thou that standst so for Posthumus
He hath a drug of mine I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that for he believes
It is a thing most precious But for her
Where is she gone Haply despair hath seized her
Or wingd with fervor of her love shes flown
To her desired Posthumus gone she is
To death or to dishonour and my end
Can make good use of either she being down
I have the placing of the British crown
Reenter CLOTEN
How now my son
Tis certain she is fled
Go in and cheer the king he rages none
Dare come about him
Aside            All the better may
This night forestall him of the coming day
Exit
I love and hate her for shes fair and royal
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
Than lady ladies woman from every one
The best she hath and she of all compounded
Outsells them all I love her therefore but
Disdaining me and throwing favours on
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
That whats else rare is choked and in that point
I will conclude to hate her nay indeed
To be revenged upon her For when fools Shall
Enter PISANIO
Who is here What are you packing sirrah
Come hither ah you precious pander Villain
Where is thy lady In a word or else
Thou art straightway with the fiends
O good my lord
Where is thy lady Or by Jupiter
I will not ask again Close villain
Ill have this secret from thy heart or rip
Thy heart to find it Is she with Posthumus
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn
Alas my lord
How can she be with him When was she missed
He is in Rome
Where is she sir Come nearer
No further halting satisfy me home
What is become of her
O my allworthy lord
Allworthy villain
Discover where thy mistress is at once
At the next word no more of worthy lord
Speak or thy silence on the instant is
Thy condemnation and thy death
Then sir
This paper is the history of my knowledge
Touching her flight
Presenting a letter
Lets seet I will pursue her
Even to Augustus throne
Aside                 Or this or perish
Shes far enough and what he learns by this
May prove his travel not her danger
Hum
Aside  Ill write to my lord shes dead O Imogen
Safe mayst thou wander safe return again
Sirrah is this letter true
Sir as I think
It is Posthumus hand I knowt Sirrah if thou
wouldst not be a villain but do me true service
undergo those employments wherein I should have
cause to use thee with a serious industry that is
what villany soeer I bid thee do to perform it
directly and truly I would think thee an honest
man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
relief nor my voice for thy preferment
Well my good lord
Wilt thou serve me for since patiently and
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
that beggar Posthumus thou canst not in the
course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of
mine wilt thou serve me
Sir I will
Give me thy hand heres my purse Hast any of thy
late masters garments in thy possession

Exit
Meet thee at MilfordHavenI forgot to ask him one
thing Ill remembert anoneven there thou
villain Posthumus will I kill thee I would these
garments were come She said upon a timethe
bitterness of it I now belch from my heartthat she
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
than my noble and natural person together with the
adornment of my qualities With that suit upon my
back will I ravish her first kill him and in her
eyes there shall she see my valour which will then
be a torment to her contempt He on the ground my
speech of insultment ended on his dead body and
when my lust hath dinedwhich as I say to vex
her I will execute in the clothes that she so
praisedto the court Ill knock her back foot
her home again She hath despised me rejoicingly
and Ill be merry in my revenge
Reenter PISANIO with the clothes
Be those the garments
Ay my noble lord
How long ist since she went to MilfordHaven
She can scarce be there yet
Bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second
thing that I have commanded thee the third is
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design Be
but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself
to thee My revenge is now at Milford would I had
wings to follow it Come and be true
Exit
Thou bidst me to my loss for true to thee
Were to prove false which I will never be
To him that is most true To Milford go
And find not her whom thou pursuest Flow flow
You heavenly blessings on her This fools speed
Be crossd with slowness labour be his meed
Exit
Enter IMOGEN in boys clothes
I see a mans life is a tedious one
I have tired myself and for two nights together
Have made the ground my bed I should be sick
But that my resolution helps me Milford
When from the mountaintop Pisanio showd thee
Thou wast within a ken O Jove I think
Foundations fly the wretched such I mean
Where they should be relieved Two beggars told me
I could not miss my way will poor folks lie
That have afflictions on them knowing tis
A punishment or trial Yes no wonder
When rich ones scarce tell true To lapse in fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars My dear lord
Thou art one o the false ones Now I think on thee
My hungers gone but even before I was
At point to sink for food But what is this
Here is a path tot tis some savage hold
I were best not to call I dare not call
yet famine
Ere clean it oerthrow nature makes it valiant
Plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever
Of hardiness is mother Ho whos here
If any thing thats civil speak if savage
Take or lend Ho No answer Then Ill enter
Best draw my sword and if mine enemy
But fear the sword like me hell scarcely look ont
Such a foe good heavens
Exit to the cave
Enter BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
You Polydote have proved best woodman and
Are master of the feast Cadwal and I

But for the end it works to Come our stomachs
Will make whats homely savoury weariness
Can snore upon the flint when resty sloth
Finds the down pillow hard Now peace be here
Poor house that keepst thyself
I am thoroughly weary
I am weak with toil yet strong in appetite
There is cold meat i the cave well browse on that
Whilst what we have killd be cookd
Looking into the cave
Stay come not in
But that it eats our victuals I should think
Here were a fairy
Whats the matter sir
By Jupiter an angel or if not
An earthly paragon Behold divineness
No elder than a boy
Reenter IMOGEN
Good masters harm me not
Before I enterd here I calld and thought
To have beggd or bought what I have took
good troth
I have stoln nought nor would not though I had found
Gold strewd i the floor Heres money for my meat
I would have left it on the board so soon
As I had made my meal and parted
With prayers for the provider
Money youth
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt
As tis no better reckond but of those
Who worship dirty gods
I see youre angry
Know if you kill me for my fault I should
Have died had I not made it
Whither bound

Whats your name
Fidele sir I have a kinsman who
Is bound for Italy he embarkd at Milford
To whom being going almost spent with hunger
I am falln in this offence
Prithee fair youth
Think us no churls nor measure our good minds
By this rude place we live in Well encounterd
Tis almost night you shall have better cheer
Ere you depart and thanks to stay and eat it
Boys bid him welcome

And such a welcome as Id give to him
After long absence such is yours most welcome
Be sprightly for you fall mongst friends
Mongst friends

Aside
Would it had been so that they
Had been my fathers sons then had my prize
Been less and so more equal ballasting

He wrings at some distress
Would I could freet
Or I whateer it be
What pain it cost what danger Gods
Hark boys
Whispering
Great men
That had a court no bigger than this cave
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
Which their own conscience seald themlaying by

Could not outpeer these twain Pardon me gods
Id change my sex to be companion with them
Since Leonatuss false
It shall be so
Boys well go dress our hunt Fair youth come in

Exeunt
Enter two Senators and Tribunes
This is the tenor of the emperors writ
Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians
And that the legions now in Gallia are
Full weak to undertake our wars against
The fallnoff Britons that we do incite
The gentry to this business He creates
Lucius preconsul and to you the tribunes
For this immediate levy he commends
His absolute commission Long live Caesar
Is Lucius general of the forces
Ay
Remaining now in Gallia
With those legions
Which I have spoke of whereunto your levy
Must be supplyant the words of your commission
Will tie you to the numbers and the time
Of their dispatch
We will discharge our duty
Exeunt
Enter CLOTEN
I am near to the place where they should meet if
Pisanio have mapped it truly How fit his garments
serve me Why should his mistress who was made by
him that made the tailor not be fit too the
rathersaving reverence of the wordfor tis said
a womans fitness comes by fits Therein I must
play the workman I dare speak it to myselffor it
is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer
in his own chamberI mean the lines of my body are
as well drawn as his no less young more strong
not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the
advantage of the time above him in birth alike
conversant in general services and more remarkable
in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant
thing loves him in my despite What mortality is
Posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy
shoulders shall within this hour be off thy
mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before
thy face and all this done spurn her home to her
father who may haply be a little angry for my so
rough usage but my mother having power of his
testiness shall turn all into my commendations My
horse is tied up safe out sword and to a sore
purpose Fortune put them into my hand This is
the very description of their meetingplace and
the fellow dares not deceive me
Exit
Enter from the cave BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS and IMOGEN
To IMOGEN  You are not well remain here in the cave
Well come to you after hunting
To IMOGENBrother stay here
Are we not brothers
So man and man should be
But clay and clay differs in dignity
Whose dust is both alike I am very sick
Go you to hunting Ill abide with him
So sick I am not yet I am not well
But not so citizen a wanton as
To seem to die ere sick so please you leave me
Stick to your journal course the breach of custom
Is breach of all I am ill but your being by me
Cannot amend me society is no comfort
To one not sociable I am not very sick
Since I can reason of it Pray you trust me here
Ill rob none but myself and let me die
Stealing so poorly
I love thee I have spoke it
How much the quantity the weight as much
As I do love my father
What how how
If it be sin to say so I yoke me
In my good brothers fault I know not why
I love this youth and I have heard you say
Loves reasons without reason the bier at door
And a demand who ist shall die Id say
My father not this youth
AsideO noble strain
O worthiness of nature breed of greatness
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base
Nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace
Im not their father yet who this should be
Doth miracle itself loved before me
Tis the ninth hour o the morn
Brother farewell
I wish ye sport
You health So please you sir
Aside  These are kind creatures Gods what lies
I have heard
Our courtiers say alls savage but at court
Experience O thou disprovest report
The imperious seas breed monsters for the dish
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish
I am sick still heartsick Pisanio
Ill now taste of thy drug
Swallows some
I could not stir him
He said he was gentle but unfortunate
Dishonestly afflicted but yet honest
Thus did he answer me yet said hereafter
I might know more
To the field to the field
Well leave you for this time go in and rest
Well not be long away
Pray be not sick
For you must be our housewife
Well or ill
I am bound to you
And shalt be ever
Exit IMOGEN to the cave
This youth hower distressd appears he hath had
Good ancestors
How angellike he sings
But his neat cookery he cut our roots
And sauced our broths as Juno had been sick
And he her dieter
Nobly he yokes
A smiling with a sigh as if the sigh
Was that it was for not being such a smile
The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
From so divine a temple to commix
With winds that sailors rail at
I do note
That grief and patience rooted in him both
Mingle their spurs together
Grow patience
And let the stinking elder grief untwine
His perishing root with the increasing vine
It is great morning Come away
Whos there
Enter CLOTEN
I cannot find those runagates that villain
Hath mockd me I am faint
Those runagates
Means he not us I partly know him tis
Cloten the son o the queen I fear some ambush
I saw him not these many years and yet
I know tis he We are held as outlaws hence
He is but one you and my brother search
What companies are near pray you away
Let me alone with him
Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
Soft What are you
That fly me thus some villain mountaineers
I have heard of such What slave art thou
A thing
More slavish did I neer than answering
A slave without a knock
Thou art a robber
A lawbreaker a villain yield thee thief
To who to thee What art thou Have not I
An arm as big as thine a heart as big
Thy words I grant are bigger for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth Say what thou art
Why I should yield to thee
Thou villain base
Knowst me not by my clothes
No nor thy tailor rascal
Who is thy grandfather he made those clothes
Which as it seems make thee
Thou precious varlet
My tailor made them not
Hence then and thank
The man that gave them thee Thou art some fool
I am loath to beat thee
Thou injurious thief
Hear but my name and tremble
Whats thy name
Cloten thou villain
Cloten thou double villain be thy name
I cannot tremble at it were it Toad or
Adder Spider
Twould move me sooner
To thy further fear
Nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know
I am son to the queen
I am sorry for t not seeming
So worthy as thy birth
Art not afeard
Those that I reverence those I fear the wise
At fools I laugh not fear them
Die the death
When I have slain thee with my proper hand
Ill follow those that even now fled hence
And on the gates of Ludstown set your heads
Yield rustic mountaineer
Exeunt fighting
Reenter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
No companies abroad
None in the world you did mistake him sure
I cannot tell long is it since I saw him
But time hath nothing blurrd those lines of favour
Which then he wore the snatches in his voice
And burst of speaking were as his I am absolute
Twas very Cloten
In this place we left them
I wish my brother make good time with him
You say he is so fell
Being scarce made up
I mean to man he had not apprehension
Of roaring terrors for the effect of judgment
Is oft the cause of fear But see thy brother
Reenter GUIDERIUS with CLOTENS head
This Cloten was a fool an empty purse
There was no money int not Hercules
Could have knockd out his brains for he had none
Yet I not doing this the fool had borne
My head as I do his
What hast thou done
I am perfect what cut off one Clotens head
Son to the queen after his own report
Who calld me traitor mountaineer and swore
With his own single hand held take us in
Displace our heads wherethank the godsthey grow
And set them on Ludstown
We are all undone
Why worthy father what have we to lose
But that he swore to take our lives The law
Protects not us then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
Play judge and executioner all himself
For we do fear the law What company
Discover you abroad
No single soul
Can we set eye on but in all safe reason
He must have some attendants Though his humour
Was nothing but mutation ay and that
From one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
Absolute madness could so far have raved
To bring him here alone although perhaps
It may be heard at court that such as we
Cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
May make some stronger head the which he hearing
As it is like himmight break out and swear
Held fetch us in yet ist not probable
To come alone either he so undertaking
Or they so suffering then on good ground we fear
If we do fear this body hath a tail
More perilous than the head
Let ordinance
Come as the gods foresay it howsoeer
My brother hath done well
I had no mind
To hunt this day the boy Fideles sickness
Did make my way long forth
With his own sword
Which he did wave against my throat I have taen
His head from him Ill throwt into the creek
Behind our rock and let it to the sea
And tell the fishes hes the queens son Cloten
Thats all I reck
Exit
I fear twill be revenged
Would Polydote thou hadst not donet though valour
Becomes thee well enough
Would I had donet
So the revenge alone pursued me Polydore
I love thee brotherly but envy much
Thou hast robbd me of this deed I would revenges
That possible strength might meet would seek us through
And put us to our answer
Well tis done
Well hunt no more today nor seek for danger
Where theres no profit I prithee to our rock
You and Fidele play the cooks Ill stay
Till hasty Polydote return and bring him
To dinner presently
Poor sick Fidele
Ill weringly to him to gain his colour
Ild let a parish of such Clotens blood
And praise myself for charity
Exit
O thou goddess
Thou divine Nature how thyself thou blazonst
In these two princely boys They are as gentle
As zephyrs blowing below the violet
Not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
Their royal blood enchafed as the rudest wind
That by the top doth take the mountain pine
And make him stoop to the vale Tis wonder
That an invisible instinct should frame them
To royalty unlearnd honour untaught
Civility not seen from other valour
That wildly grows in them but yields a crop
As if it had been sowd Yet still its strange
What Clotens being here to us portends
Or what his death will bring us
Reenter GUIDERIUS
Wheres my brother
I have sent Clotens clotpoll down the stream
In embassy to his mother his bodys hostage
For his return
Solemn music
My ingenious instrument
Hark Polydore it sounds But what occasion
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion Hark
Is he at home
He went hence even now
What does he mean since death of my dearst mother
it did not speak before All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents The matter
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys
Is Cadwal mad
Look here he comes
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Of what we blame him for
Reenter ARVIRAGUS with IMOGEN as dead bearing her in his arms
The bird is dead
That we have made so much on I had rather
Have skippd from sixteen years of age to sixty
To have turnd my leapingtime into a crutch
Than have seen this
O sweetest fairest lily
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
As when thou grewst thyself
O melancholy
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
Might easiliest harbour in Thou blessed thing
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made but I
Thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
How found you him
Stark as you see
Thus smiling as some fly hid tickled slumber
Not as deaths dart being laughd at his
right cheek
Reposing on a cushion
Where
O the floor
His arms thus leagued I thought he slept and put
My clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
Answerd my steps too loud
Why he but sleeps
If he be gone hell make his grave a bed
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted
And worms will not come to thee
With fairest flowers
Whilst summer lasts and I live here Fidele
Ill sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
The flower thats like thy face pale primrose nor
The azured harebell like thy veins no nor
The leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
Outsweetend not thy breath the ruddock would
With charitable billO bill soreshaming
Those richleft heirs that let their fathers lie
Without a monumentbring thee all this
Yea and furrd moss besides when flowers are none
To winterground thy corse
Prithee have done
And do not play in wenchlike words with that
Which is so serious Let us bury him
Is now due debt To the grave
Say where shalls lay him
By good Euriphile our mother
Bet so
And let us Polydore though now our voices
Have got the mannish crack sing him to the ground
As once our mother use like note and words
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele
Cadwal
I cannot sing Ill weep and word it with thee
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie
Well speak it then
Great griefs I see medicine the less for Cloten
Is quite forgot He was a queens son boys
And though he came our enemy remember
He was paid for that though mean and
mighty rotting
Together have one dust yet reverence
That angel of the world doth make distinction
Of place tween high and low Our foe was princely
And though you took his life as being our foe
Yet bury him as a prince
Pray You fetch him hither
Thersites body is as good as Ajax
When neither are alive
If youll go fetch him
Well say our song the whilst Brother begin
Exit BELARIUS
Nay Cadwal we must lay his head to the east
My father hath a reason fort
Tis true
Come on then and remove him
So Begin
SONG
Fear no more the heat o the sun
Nor the furious winters rages
Thou thy worldly task hast done
Home art gone and taen thy wages
Golden lads and girls all must
As chimneysweepers come to dust
Fear no more the frown o the great
Thou art past the tyrants stroke
Care no more to clothe and eat
To thee the reed is as the oak
The sceptre learning physic must
All follow this and come to dust
Fear no more the lightning flash
Nor the alldreaded thunderstone
Fear not slander censure rash
Thou hast finishd joy and moan
All lovers young all lovers must
Consign to thee and come to dust
No exorciser harm thee
Nor no witchcraft charm thee
Ghost unlaid forbear thee
Nothing ill come near thee
Quiet consummation have
And renowned be thy grave
Reenter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN
We have done our obsequies come lay him down
Heres a few flowers but bout midnight more
The herbs that have on them cold dew o the night
Are strewings fittst for graves Upon their faces
You were as flowers now witherd even so
These herblets shall which we upon you strew
Come on away apart upon our knees
The ground that gave them first has them again
Their pleasures here are past so is their pain
Exeunt BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
Awaking  Yes sir to MilfordHaven which is
the way
I thank youBy yond bushPray how far thither
Ods pittikins can it be six mile yet
I have gone all night Faith Ill lie down and sleep
But soft no bedfellowO god s and goddesses
Seeing the body of CLOTEN
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world
This bloody man the care ont I hope I dream
For so I thought I was a cavekeeper
And cook to honest creatures but tis not so
Twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing
Which the brain makes of fumes our very eyes
Are sometimes like our judgments blind Good faith
I tremble stiff with fear but if there be
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
As a wrens eye feard gods a part of it
The dreams here still even when I wake it is
Without me as within me not imagined felt
A headless man The garments of Posthumus
I know the shape ofs leg this is his hand
His foot Mercurial his Martial thigh
The brawns of Hercules but his Jovial face
Murder in heavenHowTis gone Pisanio
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks
And mine to boot be darted on thee Thou
Conspired with that irregulous devil Cloten
Hast here cut off my lord To write and read
Be henceforth treacherous Damnd Pisanio
Hath with his forged lettersdamnd Pisanio
From this most bravest vessel of the world
Struck the maintop O Posthumus alas
Where is thy head wheres that Ay me
wheres that
Pisanio might have killd thee at the heart
And left this head on How should this be Pisanio
Tis he and Cloten malice and lucre in them
Have laid this woe here O tis pregnant pregnant
The drug he gave me which he said was precious
And cordial to me have I not found it
Murderous to the senses That confirms it home
This is Pisanios deed and Clotens O
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood
That we the horrider may seem to those
Which chance to find us O my lord my lord
Falls on the body
Enter LUCIUS a Captain and other Officers and a Soothsayer
To them the legions garrisond in Gailia
After your will have crossd the sea attending
You here at MilfordHaven with your ships
They are in readiness
But what from Rome
The senate hath stirrd up the confiners
And gentlemen of Italy most willing spirits
That promise noble service and they come
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo
Syennas brother
When expect you them
With the next benefit o the wind
This forwardness
Makes our hopes fair Command our present numbers
Be musterd bid the captains look tot Now sir
What have you dreamd of late of this wars purpose
Last night the very gods showd me a vision
I fast and prayd for their intelligencethus
I saw Joves bird the Roman eagle wingd
From the spongy south to this part of the west
There vanishd in the sunbeams which portends
Unless my sins abuse my divination
Success to the Roman host
Dream often so
And never false Soft ho what trunk is here
Without his top The ruin speaks that sometime
It was a worthy building How a page
Or dead or sleeping on him But dead rather
For nature doth abhor to make his bed
With the defunct or sleep upon the dead
Lets see the boys face
Hes alive my lord
Hell then instruct us of this body Young one
Inform us of thy fortunes for it seems
They crave to be demanded Who is this
Thou makest thy bloody pillow Or who was he
That otherwise than noble nature did
Hath alterd that good picture Whats thy interest
In this sad wreck How came it Who is it
What art thou
I am nothing or if not
Nothing to be were better This was my master
A very valiant Briton and a good
That here by mountaineers lies slain Alas
There is no more such masters I may wander
From east to occident cry out for service
Try many all good serve truly never
Find such another master
Lack good youth
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
Thy master in bleeding say his name good friend
Richard du Champ
Aside
If I do lie and do
No harm by it though the gods hear I hope
Theyll pardon itSay you sir
Thy name
Fidele sir
Thou dost approve thyself the very same
Thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name
Wilt take thy chance with me I will not say
Thou shalt be so well masterd but be sure
No less beloved The Roman emperors letters
Sent by a consul to me should not sooner
Than thine own worth prefer thee go with me
Ill follow sir But first ant please the gods
Ill hide my master from the flies as deep
As these poor pickaxes can dig and when
With wild woodleaves and weeds I ha strewd his grave
And on it said a century of prayers
Such as I can twice oer Ill weep and sigh
And leaving so his service follow you
So please you entertain me
Ay good youth
And rather father thee than master thee
My friends
The boy hath taught us manly duties let us
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can
And make him with our pikes and partisans
A grave come arm him Boy he is preferrd
By thee to us and he shall be interrd
As soldiers can Be cheerful wipe thine eyes
Some falls are means the happier to arise
Exeunt
Enter CYMBELINE Lords PISANIO and Attendants
Again and bring me word how tis with her
Exit an Attendant
A fever with the absence of her son
A madness of which her lifes in danger Heavens
How deeply you at once do touch me Imogen
The great part of my comfort gone my queen
Upon a desperate bed and in a time
When fearful wars point at me her son gone
So needful for this present it strikes me past
The hope of comfort But for thee fellow
Who needs must know of her departure and
Dost seem so ignorant well enforce it from thee
By a sharp torture
Sir my life is yours
I humbly set it at your will but for my mistress
I nothing know where she remains why gone
Nor when she purposes return Beseech your highness
Hold me your loyal servant
Good my liege
The day that she was missing he was here
I dare be bound hes true and shall perform
All parts of his subjection loyally For Cloten
There wants no diligence in seeking him
And will no doubt be found
The time is troublesome
To PISANIO
Well slip you for a season but our jealousy
Does yet depend
So please your majesty
The Roman legions all from Gallia drawn
Are landed on your coast with a supply
Of Roman gentlemen by the senate sent
Now for the counsel of my son and queen
I am amazed with matter
Good my liege
Your preparation can affront no less
Than what you hear of come more for more
youre ready
The want is but to put those powers in motion
That long to move
I thank you Lets withdraw
And meet the time as it seeks us We fear not
What can from Italy annoy us but
We grieve at chances here Away
Exeunt all but PISANIO
I heard no letter from my master since
I wrote him Imogen was slain tis strange
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
To yield me often tidings neither know I
What is betid to Cloten but remain
Perplexd in all The heavens still must work
Wherein I am false I am honest not true to be true
These present wars shall find I love my country
Even to the note o the king or Ill fall in them
All other doubts by time let them be cleard
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steerd
Exit
Enter BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
The noise is round about us
Let us from it
What pleasure sir find we in life to lock it
Nay what hope
Have we in hiding us This way the Romans
Must or for Britons slay us or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use and slay us after
Sons
Well higher to the mountains there secure us
To the kings party theres no going newness
Of Clotens deathwe being not known not musterd
Among the bandsmay drive us to a render
Where we have lived and so extort froms that
Which we have done whose answer would be death
Drawn on with torture
This is sir a doubt
In such a time nothing becoming you
Nor satisfying us
It is not likely
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh
Behold their quarterd fires have both their eyes
And ears so cloyd importantly as now
That they will waste their time upon our note
To know from whence we are
O I am known
Of many in the army many years
Though Cloten then but young you see not wore him
From my remembrance And besides the king
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves
Who find in my exile the want of breeding
The certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
To have the courtesy your cradle promised
But to be still hot summers tamings and
The shrinking slaves of winter
Than be so
Better to cease to be Pray sir to the army
I and my brother are not known yourself
So out of thought and thereto so oergrown
Cannot be questiond
By this sun that shines
Ill thither what thing is it that I never
Did see man die scarce ever lookd on blood
But that of coward hares hot goats and venison
Never bestrid a horse save one that had
A rider like myself who neer wore rowel
Nor iron on his heel I am ashamed
To look upon the holy sun to have
The benefit of his blest beams remaining
So long a poor unknown
By heavens Ill go
If you will bless me sir and give me leave
Ill take the better care but if you will not
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
The hands of Romans
So say Iamen
No reason I since of your lives you set
So slight a valuation should reserve
My crackd one to more care Have with you boys
If in your country wars you chance to die
That is my bed too lads an there Ill lie
Lead lead
Aside
The time seems long their blood
thinks scorn
Till it fly out and show them princes born
Exeunt
Enter POSTHUMUS with a bloody handkerchief
Yea bloody cloth Ill keep thee for I wishd
Thou shouldst be colourd thus You married ones
If each of you should take this course how many
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little O Pisanio
Every good servant does not all commands
No bond but to do just ones Gods if you
Should have taen vengeance on my faults I never
Had lived to put on this so had you saved
The noble Imogen to repent and struck
Me wretch more worth your vengeance But alack
You snatch some hence for little faults thats love
To have them fall no more you some permit
To second ills with ills each elder worse
And make them dread it to the doers thrift
But Imogen is your own do your best wills
And make me blest to obey I am brought hither
Among the Italian gentry and to fight
Against my ladys kingdom tis enough
That Britain I have killd thy mistress peace
Ill give no wound to thee Therefore good heavens
Hear patiently my purpose Ill disrobe me
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
As does a Briton peasant so Ill fight
Against the part I come with so Ill die
For thee O Imogen even for whom my life
Is every breath a death and thus unknown
Pitied nor hated to the face of peril
Myself Ill dedicate Let me make men know
More valour in me than my habits show
Gods put the strength o the Leonati in me
To shame the guise o the world I will begin
The fashion less without and more within
Exit
Enter from one side LUCIUS IACHIMO and  the Roman Army from the other side the  British Army POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following  like a poor soldier They march over and go  out Then enter again in skirmish IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO and then leaves him
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood I have belied a lady
The princess of this country and the air ont
Revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl
A very drudge of natures have subdued me
In my profession Knighthoods and honours borne
As I wear mine are titles but of scorn
If that thy gentry Britain go before
This lout as he exceeds our lords the odds
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods
Exit
The battle continues the Britons fly CYMBELINE is  taken then enter to his rescue BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
Stand stand We have the advantage of the ground
The lane is guarded nothing routs us but
The villany of our fears
Stand stand and fight
Reenter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and seconds the  Britons they rescue CYMBELINE and exeunt Then reenter LUCIUS and IACHIMO with IMOGEN
Away boy from the troops and save thyself
For friends kill friends and the disorders such
As war were hoodwinkd
Tis their fresh supplies
It is a day turnd strangely or betimes
Lets reinforce or fly
Exeunt
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord
Camest thou from where they made the stand
I did
Though you it seems come from the fliers
I did
No blame be to you sir for all was lost
But that the heavens fought the king himself
Of his wings destitute the army broken
And but the backs of Britons seen all flying
Through a straight lane the enemy fullhearted
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work
More plentiful than tools to dot struck down
Some mortally some slightly touchd some falling
Merely through fear that the straight pass was dammd
With dead men hurt behind and cowards living
To die with lengthend shame
Where was this lane
Close by the battle ditchd and walld with turf
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
An honest one I warrant who deserved
So long a breeding as his white beard came to
In doing this fors country athwart the lane
He with two striplingslads more like to run
The country base than to commit such slaughter
With faces fit for masks or rather fairer
Than those for preservation cased or shame
Made good the passage cried to those that fled
Our Britain s harts die flying not our men
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards Stand
Or we are Romans and will give you that
Like beasts which you shun beastly and may save
But to look back in frown stand stand
These three
For three performers are the file when all
The rest do nothingwith this word Stand stand
Accommodated by the place more charming
With their own nobleness which could have turnd
A distaff to a lance gilded pale looks
Part shame part spirit renewd that some
turnd coward
But by exampleO a sin in war
Damnd in the first beginnersgan to look
The way that they did and to grin like lions
Upon the pikes o the hunters Then began
A stop i the chaser a retire anon
A rout confusion thick forthwith they fly
Chickens the way which they stoopd eagles slaves
The strides they victors made and now our cowards
Like fragments in hard voyages became
The life o the need having found the backdoor open
Of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound
Some slain before some dying some their friends
Oer borne i the former wave ten chased by one
Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
The mortal bugs o the field
This was strange chance
A narrow lane an old man and two boys
Nay do not wonder at it you are made
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
Than to work any Will you rhyme upont
And vent it for a mockery Here is one
Two boys an old man twice a boy a lane
Preserved the Britons was the Romans bane
Nay be not angry sir
Lack to what end
Who dares not stand his foe Ill be his friend
For if hell do as he is made to do
I know hell quickly fly my friendship too
You have put me into rhyme
Farewell youre angry
Still going
Exit Lord
This is a lord O noble misery
To be i the field and ask what news of me
Today how many would have given their honours
To have saved their carcasses took heel to dot
And yet died too I in mine own woe charmd
Could not find death where I did hear him groan
Nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster
Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds
Sweet words or hath more ministers than we
That draw his knives i the war Well I will find him
For being now a favourer to the Briton
No more a Briton I have resumed again
The part I came in fight I will no more
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
Once touch my shoulder Great the slaughter is
Here made by the Roman great the answer be
Britons must take For me my ransoms death
On either side I come to spend my breath
Which neither here Ill keep nor bear again
But end it by some means for Imogen
Enter two British Captains and Soldiers
Great Jupiter be praised Lucius is taken
Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels
There was a fourth man in a silly habit
That gave the affront with them
So tis reported
But none of em can be found Stand whos there
A Roman
Who had not now been drooping here if seconds
Had answerd him
Lay hands on him a dog
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
What crows have peckd them here He brags
his service
As if he were of note bring him to the king
Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS  PISANIO Soldiers Attendants and Roman Captives  The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to  CYMBELINE who delivers him over to a Gaoler then exeunt omnes
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers
You shall not now be stoln you have locks upon you
So graze as you find pasture
Ay or a stomach
Exeunt Gaolers
Most welcome bondage for thou art away
think to liberty yet am I better
Than one thats sick o the gout since he had rather
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
By the sure physician death who is the key
To unbar these locks My conscience thou art fetterd
More than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt
Then free for ever Ist enough I am sorry
So children temporal fathers do appease
Gods are more full of mercy Must I repent
I cannot do it better than in gyves
Desired more than constraind to satisfy
If of my freedom tis the main part take
No stricter render of me than my all
I know you are more clement than vile men
Who of their broken debtors take a third
A sixth a tenth letting them thrive again
On their abatement thats not my desire
For Imogens dear life take mine and though
Tis not so dear yet tis a life you coind it
Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp
Though light take pieces for the figures sake
You rather mine being yours and so great powers
If you will take this audit take this life
And cancel these cold bonds O Imogen
Ill speak to thee in silence
Sleeps
Solemn music Enter as in an apparition  SICILIUS LEONATUS father to Posthumus Leonatus  an old man attired like a warrior leading in  his hand an ancient matron his wife and mother  to Posthumus Leonatus with music before them  then after other music follow the two young  Leonati brothers to Posthumus Leonatus with  wounds as they died in the wars They circle Posthumus Leonatus round as he lies sleeping
No more thou thundermaster show
Thy spite on mortal flies
With Mars fall out with Juno chide
That thy adulteries
Rates and revenges
Hath my poor boy done aught but well
Whose face I never saw
I died whilst in the womb he stayd
Attending natures law
Whose father then as men report
Thou orphans father art
Thou shouldst have been and shielded him
From this earthvexing smart
Lucina lent not me her aid
But took me in my throes
That from me was Posthumus ript
Came crying mongst his foes
A thing of pity
Great nature like his ancestry
Moulded the stuff so fair
That he deserved the praise o the world
As great Sicilius heir
When once he was mature for man
In Britain where was he
That could stand up his parallel
Or fruitful object be
In eye of Imogen that best
Could deem his dignity
With marriage wherefore was he mockd
To be exiled and thrown
From Leonati seat and cast
From her his dearest one
Sweet Imogen
Why did you suffer Iachimo
Slight thing of Italy
To taint his nobler heart and brain
With needless jealosy
And to become the geck and scorn
O th others villany
For this from stiller seats we came
Our parents and us twain
That striking in our countrys cause
Fell bravely and were slain
Our fealty and Tenantius right
With honour to maintain
Like hardiment Posthumus hath
To Cymbeline performd
Then Jupiter thou king of gods
Why hast thou thus adjournd
The graces for his merits due
Being all to dolours turnd
Thy crystal window ope look out
No longer exercise
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
And potent injuries
Since Jupiter our son is good
Take off his miseries
Peep through thy marble mansion help
Or we poor ghosts will cry
To the shining synod of the rest
Against thy deity
Help Jupiter or we appeal
And from thy justice fly
Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting  upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt The Apparitions fall on their knees
No more you petty spirits of region low
Offend our hearing hush How dare you ghosts
Accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
Skyplanted batters all rebelling coasts
Poor shadows of Elysium hence and rest
Upon your neverwithering banks of flowers
Be not with mortal accidents opprest
No care of yours it is you know tis ours
Whom best I love I cross to make my gift
The more delayd delighted Be content
Your lowlaid son our godhead will uplift
His comforts thrive his trials well are spent
Our Jovial star reignd at his birth and in
Our temple was he married Rise and fade
He shall be lord of lady Imogen
And happier much by his affliction made
This tablet lay upon his breast wherein
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
and so away no further with your din
Express impatience lest you stir up mine
Mount eagle to my palace crystalline
Ascends
He came in thunder his celestial breath
Was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle
Stoopd as to foot us his ascension is
More sweet than our blest fields his royal bird
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
As when his god is pleased
Thanks Jupiter
The marble pavement closes he is enterd
His radiant root Away and to be blest
Let us with care perform his great behest
The Apparitions vanish
Waking  Sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot
A father to me and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers but O scorn
Gone they went hence so soon as they were born
And so I am awake Poor wretches that depend
On greatness favour dream as I have done
Wake and find nothing But alas I swerve
Many dream not to find neither deserve
And yet are steepd in favours so am I
That have this golden chance and know not why
What fairies haunt this ground A book O rare one
Be not as is our fangled world a garment
Nobler than that it covers let thy effects
So follow to be most unlike our courtiers
As good as promise
Reads
When as a lions whelp shall to himself unknown
without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of
tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be
lopped branches which being dead many years
shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and
freshly grow then shall Posthumus end his miseries
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty
Tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
Tongue and brain not either both or nothing
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
As sense cannot untie Be what it is
Ill keep if but for sympathy
Reenter First Gaoler
Come sir are you ready for death
Overroasted rather ready long ago
Hanging is the word sir if
you be ready for that you are well cooked
So if I prove a good repast to the
spectators the dish pays the shot
A heavy reckoning for you sir But the comfort is
you shall be called to no more payments fear no
more tavernbills which are often the sadness of
parting as the procuring of mirth you come in
flint for want of meat depart reeling with too
much drink sorry that you have paid too much and
sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain
both empty the brain the heavier for being too
light the purse too light being drawn of
heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be
quit O the charity of a penny cord It sums up
thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and
creditor but it of whats past is and to come
the discharge your neck sir is pen book and
counters so the acquittance follows
I am merrier to die than thou art to live
Indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the
toothache but a man that were to sleep your
sleep and a hangman to help him to bed I think he
would change places with his officer for look you
sir you know not which way you shall go
Yes indeed do I fellow
Your death has eyes in s head then I have not seen
him so pictured you must either be directed by
some that take upon them to know or do take upon
yourself that which I am sure you do not know or
jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how
you shall speed in your journeys end I think youll
never return to tell one
I tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to
direct them the way I am going but such as wink and
will not use them
What an infinite mock is this that a man should
have the best use of eyes to see the way of
blindness I am sure hangings the way of winking
Enter a Messenger
Knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king
Thou bringst good news I am called to be made free
Ill be hangd then
Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger
Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
gibbets I never saw one so prone Yet on my
conscience there are verier knaves desire to live
for all he be a Roman and there be some of them
too that die against their wills so should I if I
were one I would we were all of one mind and one
mind good O there were desolation of gaolers and
gallowses I speak against my present profit but
my wish hath a preferment in t

Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS PISANIO Lords Officers and Attendants
Stand by my side you whom the gods have made
Preservers of my throne Woe is my heart
That the poor soldier that so richly fought
Whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast
Steppd before larges of proof cannot be found
He shall be happy that can find him if
Our grace can make him so
I never saw
Such noble fury in so poor a thing
Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
But beggary and poor looks
No tidings of him
He hath been searchd among the dead and living
But no trace of him
To my grief I am
The heir of his reward
To BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
which I will add
To you the liver heart and brain of Britain
By whom I grant she lives Tis now the time
To ask of whence you are Report it
Sir
In Cambria are we born and gentlemen
Further to boast were neither true nor modest
Unless I add we are honest
Bow your knees
Arise my knights o the battle I create you
Companions to our person and will fit you
With dignities becoming your estates
Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies
Theres business in these faces Why so sadly
Greet you our victory you look like Romans
And not o the court of Britain
Hail great king
To sour your happiness I must report
The queen is dead
Who worse than a physician
Would this report become But I consider
By medicine life may be prolongd yet death
Will seize the doctor too How ended she
With horror madly dying like her life
Which being cruel to the world concluded
Most cruel to herself What she confessd
I will report so please you these her women
Can trip me if I err who with wet cheeks
Were present when she finishd
Prithee say
First she confessd she never loved you only
Affected greatness got by you not you
Married your royalty was wife to your place
Abhorrd your person
She alone knew this
And but she spoke it dying I would not
Believe her lips in opening it Proceed
Your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
With such integrity she did confess
Was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
But that her flight prevented it she had
Taen off by poison
O most delicate fiend
Who is t can read a woman Is there more
More sir and worse She did confess she had
For you a mortal mineral which being took
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
By inches waste you in which time she purposed
By watching weeping tendance kissing to
Oercome you with her show and in time
When she had fitted you with her craft to work
Her son into the adoption of the crown
But failing of her end by his strange absence
Grew shamelessdesperate opend in despite
Of heaven and men her purposes repented
The evils she hatchd were not effected so
Despairing died
Heard you all this her women
We did so please your highness
Mine eyes
Were not in fault for she was beautiful
Mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
That thought her like her seeming it had
been vicious
To have mistrusted her yet O my daughter
That it was folly in me thou mayst say
And prove it in thy feeling Heaven mend all
Enter LUCIUS IACHIMO the Soothsayer and other  Roman Prisoners guarded POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind and IMOGEN
Thou comest not Caius now for tribute that
The Britons have razed out though with the loss
Of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
Of you their captives which ourself have granted
So think of your estate
Consider sir the chance of war the day
Was yours by accident had it gone with us
We should not when the blood was cool
have threatend
Our prisoners with the sword But since the gods
Will have it thus that nothing but our lives
May be calld ransom let it come sufficeth
A Roman with a Romans heart can suffer
Augustus lives to think ont and so much
For my peculiar care This one thing only
I will entreat my boy a Briton born
Let him be ransomd never master had
A page so kind so duteous diligent
So tender over his occasions true
So feat so nurselike let his virtue join
With my request which I make bold your highness
Cannot deny he hath done no Briton harm

And spare no blood beside
I have surely seen him
His favour is familiar to me Boy
Thou hast lookd thyself into my grace
And art mine own I know not why wherefore
To say live boy neer thank thy master live
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt
Fitting my bounty and thy state Ill give it
Yea though thou do demand a prisoner
The noblest taen
I humbly thank your highness
I do not bid thee beg my life good lad
And yet I know thou wilt
No no alack
Theres other work in hand I see a thing
Bitter to me as death your life good master
Must shuffle for itself
The boy disdains me
He leaves me scorns me briefly die their joys
That place them on the truth of girls and boys
Why stands he so perplexd
What wouldst thou boy
I love thee more and more think more and more
Whats best to ask Knowst him thou lookst on speak
Wilt have him live Is he thy kin thy friend
He is a Roman no more kin to me
Than I to your highness who being born your vassal
Am something nearer
Wherefore eyest him so

To give me hearing
Ay with all my heart
And lend my best attention Whats thy name

Since she is living let the time run on
To good or bad
CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward
Come stand thou by our side
Make thy demand aloud
To IACHIMO
Sir step you forth
Give answer to this boy and do it freely
Or by our greatness and the grace of it
Which is our honour bitter torture shall
Winnow the truth from falsehood On speak to him
My boon is that this gentleman may render
Of whom he had this ring
Aside                 Whats that to him
That diamond upon your finger say
How came it yours
Thoult torture me to leave unspoken that
Which to be spoke would torture thee
How me
I am glad to be constraind to utter that
Which torments me to conceal By villany
I got this ring twas Leonatus jewel
Whom thou didst banish andwhich more may
grieve thee
As it doth mea nobler sir neer lived
Twixt sky and ground Wilt thou hear more my lord
All that belongs to this
That paragon thy daughter
For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
Quail to rememberGive me leave I faint
My daughter what of her Renew thy strength
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
Than die ere I hear more strive man and speak
Upon a timeunhappy was the clock
That struck the hourit was in Romeaccursed
The mansion wheretwas at a feastO would
Our viands had been poisond or at least
Those which I heaved to headthe good Posthumus
What should I say he was too good to be
Where ill men were and was the best of all
Amongst the rarest of good onessitting sadly
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
For beauty that made barren the swelld boast
Of him that best could speak for feature laming
The shrine of Venus or straightpight Minerva
Postures beyond brief nature for condition
A shop of all the qualities that man
Loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
Fairness which strikes the eye
I stand on fire
Come to the matter
All too soon I shall
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly This Posthumus
Most like a noble lord in love and one
That had a royal lover took his hint
And not dispraising whom we praisedtherein
He was as calm as virtuehe began
His mistress picture which by his tongue
being made
And then a mind put int either our brags
Were crackd of kitchentrolls or his description
Proved us unspeaking sots
Nay nay to the purpose
Your daughters chastitythere it begins
He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
And she alone were cold whereat I wretch
Made scruple of his praise and wagerd with him
Pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore
Upon his honourd finger to attain
In suit the place ofs bed and win this ring
By hers and mine adultery He true knight
No lesser of her honour confident
Than I did truly find her stakes this ring
And would so had it been a carbuncle
Of Phoebus wheel and might so safely had it
Been all the worth ofs car Away to Britain
Post I in this design well may you sir
Remember me at court where I was taught
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
Twixt amorous and villanous Being thus quenchd
Of hope not longing mine Italian brain
Gan in your duller Britain operate
Most vilely for my vantage excellent
That I returnd with simular proof enough
To make the noble Leonatus mad
By wounding his belief in her renown
With tokens thus and thus averting notes
Of chamberhanging pictures this her bracelet
O cunning how I got itnay some marks
Of secret on her person that he could not
But think her bond of chastity quite crackd
I having taen the forfeit Whereupon
Methinks I see him now
Advancing             Ay so thou dost
Italian fiend Ay me most credulous fool
Egregious murderer thief any thing
Thats due to all the villains past in being
To come O give me cord or knife or poison
Some upright justicer Thou king send out
For torturers ingenious it is I
That all the abhorred things o the earth amend
By being worse than they I am Posthumus
That killd thy daughtervillainlike I lie
That caused a lesser villain than myself
A sacrilegious thief to dot the temple
Of virtue was she yea and she herself
Spit and throw stone s cast mire upon me set
The dogs o the street to bay me every villain
Be calld Posthumus Leonitus and
Be villany less than twas O Imogen
My queen my life my wife O Imogen

Shalls have a play of this Thou scornful page
There lie thy part
Striking her she falls
O gentlemen help
Mine and your mistress O my lord Posthumus
You neer killd Imogen til now Help help
Mine honourd lady
Does the world go round
How come these staggers on me
Wake my mistress
If this be so the gods do mean to strike me
To death with mortal joy
How fares thy mistress
O get thee from my sight
Thou gavest me poison dangerous fellow hence
Breathe not where princes are
The tune of Imogen
Lady
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing I had it from the queen
New matter still
It poisond me
O gods
I left out one thing which the queen confessd
Which must approve thee honest If Pisanio
Have said she given his mistress that confection
Which I gave him for cordial she is served
As I would serve a rat
Whats this Comelius
The queen sir very oft importuned me
To temper poisons for her still pretending
In killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
Of no esteem I dreading that her purpose
Was of more danger did compound for her
A certain stuff which being taen would cease
The present power of life but in short time
All offices of nature should again
Do their due functions Have you taen of it
Most like I did for I was dead
My boys
There was our error
This is sure Fidele
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you
Think that you are upon a rock and now
Throw me again
Embracing him
Hang there like a fruit my soul
Till the tree die
How now my flesh my child
Wilt thou not speak to me
Kneeling               Your blessing sir
To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS  Though you did love
this youth I blame ye not
You had a motive fort
My tears that fall
Prove holy water on thee Imogen
Thy mothers dead
I am sorry fort my lord
O she was nought and long of her it was
That we meet here so strangely but her son
Is gone we know not how nor where
My lord
Now fear is from me Ill speak troth Lord Cloten
Upon my ladys missing came to me
With his sword drawn foamd at the mouth and swore
If I discoverd not which way she was gone
It was my instant death By accident
had a feigned letter of my masters
Then in my pocket which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford
Where in a frenzy in my masters garments
Which he enforced from me away he posts
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
My ladys honour what became of him
I further know not
Let me end the story
I slew him there
Marry the gods forfend
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a bard sentence prithee valiant youth
Denyt again
I have spoke it and I did it
He was a prince
A most incivil one the wrongs he did me
Were nothing princelike for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea
If it could so roar to me I cut offs head
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine
I am sorry for thee
By thine own tongue thou art condemnd and must
Endure our law thourt dead
That headless man
I thought had been my lord
Bind the offender
And take him from our presence
Stay sir king
This man is better than the man he slew
As well descended as thyself and hath
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Had ever scar for
To the Guard
Let his arms alone
They were not born for bondage
Why old soldier
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
By tasting of our wrath How of descent
As good as we
In that he spake too far
And thou shalt die fort
We will die all three
But I will prove that two ons are as good
As I have given out him My sons I must
For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
Though haply well for you
Your dangers ours
And our good his
Have at it then by leave
Thou hadst great king a subject who
Was calld Belarius
What of him he is
A banishd traitor
He it is that hath
Assumed this age indeed a banishd man
I know not how a traitor
Take him hence
The whole world shall not save him
Not too hot
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons
And let it be confiscate all so soon
As I have received it
Nursing of my sons
I am too blunt and saucy heres my knee
Ere I arise I will prefer my sons
Then spare not the old father Mighty sir
These two young gentlemen that call me father
And think they are my sons are none of mine
They are the issue of your loins my liege
And blood of your begetting
How my issue
So sure as you your fathers I old Morgan
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banishd
Your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
Itself and all my treason that I sufferd
Was all the harm I did These gentle princes
For such and so they arethese twenty years
Have I traind up those arts they have as I
Could put into them my breeding was sir as
Your highness knows Their nurse Euriphile
Whom for the theft I wedded stole these children
Upon my banishment I moved her tot
Having received the punishment before
For that which I did then beaten for loyalty
Excited me to treason their dear loss
The more of you twas felt the more it shaped
Unto my end of stealing them But gracious sir
Here are your sons again and I must lose
Two of the sweetst companions in the world
The benediction of these covering heavens
Fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
To inlay heaven with stars
Thou weepst and speakst
The service that you three have done is more
Unlike than this thou tellst I lost my children
If these be they I know not how to wish
A pair of worthier sons
Be pleased awhile
This gentleman whom I call Polydore
Most worthy prince as yours is true Guiderius
This gentleman my Cadwal Arviragus
Your younger princely son he sir was lappd
In a most curious mantle wrought by the hand
Of his queen mother which for more probation
I can with ease produce
Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
It was a mark of wonder
This is he
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp
It was wise natures end in the donation
To be his evidence now
O what am I
A mother to the birth of three Neer mother
Rejoiced deliverance more Blest pray you be
That after this strange starting from your orbs
may reign in them now O Imogen
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom
No my lord
I have got two worlds by t O my gentle brothers
Have we thus met O never say hereafter
But I am truest speaker you calld me brother
When I was but your sister I you brothers
When ye were so indeed
Did you eer meet
Ay my good lord
And at first meeting loved
Continued so until we thought he died
By the queens dram she swallowd
O rare instinct
When shall I hear all through This fierce
abridgement
Hath to it circumstantial branches which
Distinction should be rich in Where how lived You
And when came you to serve our Roman captive
How parted with your brothers how first met them
Why fled you from the court and whither These
And your three motives to the battle with
I know not how much more should be demanded
And all the other bydependencies
From chance to chance but nor the time nor place
Will serve our long intergatories See
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen
And she like harmless lightning throws her eye
On him her brother me her master hitting
Each object with a joy the counterchange
Is severally in all Lets quit this ground
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices
To BELARIUS
Thou art my brother so well hold thee ever
You are my father too and did relieve me
To see this gracious season
All oerjoyd
Save these in bonds let them be joyful too
For they shall taste our comfort
My good master
I will yet do you service
Happy be you
The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
He would have well becomed this place and graced
The thankings of a king
I am sir
The soldier that did company these three
In poor beseeming twas a fitment for
The purpose I then followd That I was he
Speak Iachimo I had you down and might
Have made you finish
Kneeling          I am down again
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
As then your force did Take that life beseech you
Which I so often owe but your ring first
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
That ever swore her faith
Kneel not to me
The power that I have on you is to spare you
The malice towards you to forgive you live
And deal with others better
Nobly doomd
Well learn our freeness of a soninlaw
Pardons the word to all
You holp us sir
As you did mean indeed to be our brother
Joyd are we that you are
Your servant princes Good my lord of Rome
Call forth your soothsayer as I slept methought
Great Jupiter upon his eagle backd
Appeard to me with other spritely shows
Of mine own kindred when I waked I found
This label on my bosom whose containing
Is so from sense in hardness that I can
Make no collection of it let him show
His skill in the construction
Philarmonus
Here my good lord
Read and declare the meaning
Reads  When as a lions whelp shall to himself
unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a
piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar
shall be lopped branches which being dead many
years shall after revive be jointed to the old
stock and freshly grow then shall Posthumus end
his miseries Britain be fortunate and flourish in
peace and plenty
Thou Leonatus art the lions whelp
The fit and apt construction of thy name
Being Leonatus doth import so much
To CYMBELINE
The piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
Which we call mollis aer and mollis aer
We term it mulier which mulier I divine
Is this most constant wife who even now
Answering the letter of the oracle
Unknown to you unsought were clippd about
With this most tender air
This hath some seeming
The lofty cedar royal Cymbeline
Personates thee and thy loppd branches point
Thy two sons forth who by Belarius stoln
For many years thought dead are now revived
To the majestic cedar joind whose issue
Promises Britain peace and plenty
Well
My peace we will begin And Caius Lucius
Although the victor we submit to Caesar
And to the Roman empire promising
To pay our wonted tribute from the which
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen
Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
Have laid most heavy hand
The fingers of the powers above do tune
The harmony of this peace The vision
Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
Of this yet scarcecold battle at this instant
Is full accomplishd for the Roman eagle
From south to west on wing soaring aloft
Lessend herself and in the beams o the sun
So vanishd which foreshowd our princely eagle
The imperial Caesar should again unite
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline
Which shines here in the west
Laud we the gods
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
From our blest altars Publish we this peace
To all our subjects Set we forward let
A Roman and a British ensign wave
Friendly together so through Ludstown march
And in the temple of great Jupiter
Our peace well ratify seal it with feasts
Set on there Never was a war did cease
Ere bloody hands were washd with such a peace
Exeunt
FRANCISCO at his post Enter to him BERNARDO
Whos there
Nay answer me stand and unfold yourself
Long live the king
Bernardo
He
You come most carefully upon your hour
Tis now struck twelve get thee to bed Francisco
For this relief much thanks tis bitter cold
And I am sick at heart
Have you had quiet guard
Not a mouse stirring
Well good night
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus
The rivals of my watch bid them make haste
I think I hear them Stand ho Whos there
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
Friends to this ground
And liegemen to the Dane
Give you good night
O farewell honest soldier
Who hath relieved you
Bernardo has my place
Give you good night
Exit
Holla Bernardo
Say
What is Horatio there
A piece of him
Welcome Horatio welcome good Marcellus
What has this thing appeard again tonight
I have seen nothing
Horatio says tis but our fantasy
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night
That if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it
Tush tush twill not appear
Sit down awhile
And let us once again assail your ears
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen
Well sit we down
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this
Last night of all
When yond same star thats westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns Marcellus and myself
The bell then beating one
Enter Ghost
Peace break thee off look where it comes again
In the same figure like the king thats dead
Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio
Looks it not like the king  mark it Horatio
Most like it harrows me with fear and wonder
It would be spoke to
Question it Horatio
What art thou that usurpst this time of night
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march by heaven I charge thee speak
It is offended
See it stalks away
Stay speak speak I charge thee speak
Exit Ghost
Tis gone and will not answer
How now Horatio you tremble and look pale
Is not this something more than fantasy
What think you ont
Before my God I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes
Is it not like the king
As thou art to thyself
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated
So frownd he once when in an angry parle
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
Tis strange
Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
In what particular thought to work I know not
But in the gross and scope of my opinion
This bodes some strange eruption to our state
Good now sit down and tell me he that knows
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war
Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week
What might be toward that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night jointlabourer with the day
Who ist that can inform me
That can I
At least the whisper goes so Our last king
Whose image even but now appeard to us
Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride
Dared to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet
For so this side of our known world esteemd him
Well ratified by law and heraldry
Did forfeit with his life all those his lands
Which he stood seized of to the conqueror
Against the which a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king which had returnd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras
Had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant
And carriage of the article designd
His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
Of unimproved mettle hot and full
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes
For food and diet to some enterprise
That hath a stomach int which is no other
As it doth well appear unto our state
But to recover of us by strong hand
And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
So by his father lost and this I take it
Is the main motive of our preparations
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this posthaste and romage in the land
I think it be no other but een so
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars
A mote it is to trouble the minds eye
In the most high and palmy state of Rome
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Disasters in the sun and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
And even the like precurse of fierce events
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen
But soft behold lo where it comes again
Reenter Ghost
Ill cross it though it blast me Stay illusion
If thou hast any sound or use of voice
Speak to me
If there be any good thing to be done
That may to thee do ease and grace to me
Speak to me
Cock crows
If thou art privy to thy countrys fate
Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
For which they say you spirits oft walk in death
Speak of it stay and speak Stop it Marcellus
Shall I strike at it with my partisan
Do if it will not stand
Tis here
Tis here
Tis gone
Exit Ghost
We do it wrong being so majestical
To offer it the show of violence
For it is as the air invulnerable
And our vain blows malicious mockery
It was about to speak when the cock crew
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons I have heard
The cock that is the trumpet to the morn
Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
Awake the god of day and at his warning
Whether in sea or fire in earth or air
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine and of the truth herein
This present object made probation
It faded on the crowing of the cock
Some say that ever gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated
The bird of dawning singeth all night long
And then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
The nights are wholesome then no planets strike
No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
So hallowd and so gracious is the time
So have I heard and do in part believe it
But look the morn in russet mantle clad
Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill
Break we our watch up and by my advice
Let us impart what we have seen tonight
Unto young Hamlet for upon my life
This spirit dumb to us will speak to him
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
As needful in our loves fitting our duty
Lets dot I pray and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently
Exeunt
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE HAMLET  POLONIUS LAERTES VOLTIMAND CORNELIUS Lords and Attendants
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death
The memory be green and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves
Therefore our sometime sister now our queen
The imperial jointress to this warlike state
Have we as twere with a defeated joy
With an auspicious and a dropping eye
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
In equal scale weighing delight and dole
Taken to wife nor have we herein barrd
Your better wisdoms which have freely gone
With this affair along For all our thanks
Now follows that you know young Fortinbras
Holding a weak supposal of our worth
Or thinking by our late dear brothers death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage
He hath not faild to pester us with message
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father with all bonds of law
To our most valiant brother So much for him
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
Thus much the business is we have here writ
To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras
Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
Of this his nephews purposeto suppress
His further gait herein in that the levies
The lists and full proportions are all made
Out of his subject and we here dispatch
You good Cornelius and you Voltimand
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow
Farewell and let your haste commend your duty
In that and all things will we show our duty
We doubt it nothing heartily farewell
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
And now Laertes whats the news with you
You told us of some suit what ist Laertes
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
And loose your voice what wouldst thou beg Laertes
That shall not be my offer not thy asking
The head is not more native to the heart
The hand more instrumental to the mouth
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
What wouldst thou have Laertes
My dread lord
Your leave and favour to return to France
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
To show my duty in your coronation
Yet now I must confess that duty done
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
Have you your fathers leave What says Polonius
He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition and at last
Upon his will I seald my hard consent
I do beseech you give him leave to go
Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine
And thy best graces spend it at thy will
But now my cousin Hamlet and my son
Aside  A little more than kin and less than kind
How is it that the clouds still hang on you
Not so my lord I am too much i the sun
Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust
Thou knowst tis common all that lives must die
Passing through nature to eternity
Ay madam it is common
If it be
Why seems it so particular with thee
Seems madam nay it is I know not seems
Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
Nor customary suits of solemn black
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath
No nor the fruitful river in the eye
Nor the dejected havior of the visage
Together with all forms moods shapes of grief
That can denote me truly these indeed seem
But I have that within which passeth show
These but the trappings and the suits of woe
Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet
To give these mourning duties to your father
But you must know your father lost a father
That father lost lost his and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven
A heart unfortified a mind impatient
An understanding simple and unschoold
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaven
A fault against the dead a fault to nature
To reason most absurd whose common theme
Is death of fathers and who still hath cried
From the first corse till he that died today
This must be so We pray you throw to earth
This unprevailing woe and think of us
As of a father for let the world take note
You are the most immediate to our throne
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son
Do I impart toward you For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg
It is most retrograde to our desire
And we beseech you bend you to remain
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg
I shall in all my best obey you madam
Why tis a loving and a fair reply
Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
And the kings rouse the heavens all bruit again
Respeaking earthly thunder Come away
Exeunt all but HAMLET
O that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew
Or that the Everlasting had not fixd
His canon gainst selfslaughter O God God
How weary stale flat and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world
Fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden
That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely That it should come to this
But two months dead nay not so much not two
So excellent a king that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth
Must I remember why she would hang on him
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on and yet within a month
Let me not think ontFrailty thy name is woman
A little month or ere those shoes were old
With which she followd my poor fathers body
Like Niobe all tearswhy she even she
O God a beast that wants discourse of reason
Would have mournd longermarried with my uncle
My fathers brother but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules within a month
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes
She married O most wicked speed to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets
It is not nor it cannot come to good
But break my heart for I must hold my tongue
Enter HORATIO MARCELLUS and BERNARDO
Hail to your lordship
I am glad to see you well
Horatioor I do forget myself
The same my lord and your poor servant ever
Sir my good friend Ill change that name with you
And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio Marcellus
My good lord
I am very glad to see you Good even sir
But what in faith make you from Wittenberg
A truant disposition good my lord
I would not hear your enemy say so
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself I know you are no truant
But what is your affair in Elsinore
Well teach you to drink deep ere you depart
My lord I came to see your fathers funeral
I pray thee do not mock me fellowstudent
I think it was to see my mothers wedding
Indeed my lord it followd hard upon
Thrift thrift Horatio the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day Horatio
My fathermethinks I see my father
Where my lord
In my minds eye Horatio
I saw him once he was a goodly king
He was a man take him for all in all
I shall not look upon his like again
My lord I think I saw him yesternight
Saw who
My lord the king your father
The king my father
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear till I may deliver
Upon the witness of these gentlemen
This marvel to you
For Gods love let me hear
Two nights together had these gentlemen
Marcellus and Bernardo on their watch
In the dead vast and middle of the night
Been thus encounterd A figure like your father
Appears before them and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd
By their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes
Within his truncheons length whilst they distilled
Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did
And I with them the third night kept the watch
Where as they had deliverd both in time
Form of the thing each word made true and good
The apparition comes I knew your father
These hands are not more like
But where was this
My lord upon the platform where we watchd
Did you not speak to it
My lord I did
But answer made it none yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion like as it would speak
But even then the morning cock crew loud
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And vanishd from our sight
Tis very strange
As I do live my honourd lord tis true
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it
Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
Hold you the watch tonight
We do my lord
Armd say you
Armd my lord
From top to toe
My lord from head to foot
Then saw you not his face
O yes my lord he wore his beaver up
What lookd he frowningly
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger
Pale or red
Nay very pale
And fixd his eyes upon you
Most constantly
I would I had been there
It would have much amazed you
Very like very like Stayd it long
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
Longer longer
Not when I sawt
His beard was grizzledno
It was as I have seen it in his life
A sable silverd
I will watch tonight
Perchance twill walk again
I warrant it will
If it assume my noble fathers person
Ill speak to it though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace I pray you all
If you have hitherto conceald this sight
Let it be tenable in your silence still
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight
Give it an understanding but no tongue
I will requite your loves So fare you well
Upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve
Ill visit you
Our duty to your honour
Your loves as mine to you farewell
Exeunt all but HAMLET
My fathers spirit in arms all is not well
I doubt some foul play would the night were come
Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes
Exit
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
My necessaries are embarkd farewell
And sister as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant do not sleep
But let me hear from you
Do you doubt that
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
A violet in the youth of primy nature
Forward not permanent sweet not lasting
The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more
No more but so
Think it no more
For nature crescent does not grow alone
In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will but you must fear
His greatness weighd his will is not his own
For he himself is subject to his birth
He may not as unvalued persons do
Carve for himself for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
May give his saying deed which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
If with too credent ear you list his songs
Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
To his unmasterd importunity
Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister
And keep you in the rear of your affection
Out of the shot and danger of desire
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty to the moon
Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes
The canker galls the infants of the spring
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent
Be wary then best safety lies in fear
Youth to itself rebels though none else near
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep
As watchman to my heart But good my brother
Do not as some ungracious pastors do
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
Whiles like a puffd and reckless libertine
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
And recks not his own rede
O fear me not
I stay too long but here my father comes
Enter POLONIUS
A double blessing is a double grace
Occasion smiles upon a second leave
Yet here Laertes aboard aboard for shame
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
And you are stayd for There my blessing with thee
And these few precepts in thy memory
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each newhatchd unfledged comrade Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel but being in
Beart that the opposed may beware of thee
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice
Take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
But not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy
For the apparel oft proclaims the man
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that
Neither a borrower nor a lender be
For loan oft loses both itself and friend
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
This above all to thine ownself be true
And it must follow as the night the day
Thou canst not then be false to any man
Farewell my blessing season this in thee
Most humbly do I take my leave my lord
The time invites you go your servants tend
Farewell Ophelia and remember well
What I have said to you
Tis in my memory lockd
And you yourself shall keep the key of it
Farewell
Exit
What ist Ophelia be hath said to you
So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
Marry well bethought
Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous
If it be so as so tis put on me
And that in way of caution I must tell you
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour
What is between you give me up the truth
He hath my lord of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me
Affection pooh you speak like a green girl
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance
Do you believe his tenders as you call them
I do not know my lord what I should think
Marry Ill teach you think yourself a baby
That you have taen these tenders for true pay
Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly
Ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
Running it thusyoull tender me a fool
My lord he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion
Ay fashion you may call it go to go to
And hath given countenance to his speech my lord
With almost all the holy vows of heaven
Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know
When the blood burns how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
Giving more light than heat extinct in both
Even in their promise as it is amaking
You must not take for fire From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet
Believe so much in him that he is young
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you in few Ophelia
Do not believe his vows for they are brokers
Not of that dye which their investments show
But mere implorators of unholy suits
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
The better to beguile This is for all
I would not in plain terms from this time forth
Have you so slander any moment leisure
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
Look tot I charge you come your ways
I shall obey my lord
Exeunt
Enter HAMLET HORATIO and MARCELLUS
The air bites shrewdly it is very cold
It is a nipping and an eager air
What hour now
I think it lacks of twelve
No it is struck
Indeed I heard it not then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
A flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within
What does this mean my lord
The king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels
And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge
Is it a custom
Ay marry ist
But to my mind though I am native here
And to the manner born it is a custom
More honourd in the breach than the observance
This heavyheaded revel east and west
Makes us traduced and taxd of other nations
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition and indeed it takes
From our achievements though performd at height
The pith and marrow of our attribute
So oft it chances in particular men
That for some vicious mole of nature in them
As in their birthwherein they are not guilty
Since nature cannot choose his origin
By the oergrowth of some complexion
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
Or by some habit that too much oerleavens
The form of plausive manners that these men
Carrying I say the stamp of one defect
Being natures livery or fortunes star
Their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace
As infinite as man may undergo
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal
Look my lord it comes
Enter Ghost
Angels and ministers of grace defend us
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
Be thy intents wicked or charitable
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee Ill call thee Hamlet
King father royal Dane O answer me
Let me not burst in ignorance but tell
Why thy canonized bones hearsed in death
Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
To cast thee up again What may this mean
That thou dead corse again in complete steel
Revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon
Making night hideous and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
Say why is this wherefore what should we do
Ghost beckons HAMLET
It beckons you to go away with it
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone
It waves you to a more removed ground
But do not go with it
No by no means
It will not speak then I will follow it
Do not my lord
Why what should be the fear
I do not set my life in a pins fee
And for my soul what can it do to that
Being a thing immortal as itself
It waves me forth again Ill follow it
What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles oer his base into the sea
And there assume some other horrible form
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness think of it
The very place puts toys of desperation
Without more motive into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath
It waves me still
Go on Ill follow thee
You shall not go my lord
Hold off your hands
Be ruled you shall not go
My fate cries out
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lions nerve
Still am I calld Unhand me gentlemen
By heaven Ill make a ghost of him that lets me
I say away Go on Ill follow thee
Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET
He waxes desperate with imagination
Lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him
Have after To what issue will this come
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
Heaven will direct it
Nay lets follow him
Exeunt
Enter GHOST and HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me speak Ill go no further
Mark me
I will
My hour is almost come
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself
Alas poor ghost
Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold
Speak I am bound to hear
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
What
I am thy fathers spirit
Doomd for a certain term to walk the night
And for the day confined to fast in fires
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prisonhouse
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood List list O list
If thou didst ever thy dear father love
O God
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
Murder
Murder most foul as in the best it is
But this most foul strange and unnatural
Haste me to knowt that I with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love
May sweep to my revenge
I find thee apt
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear
Tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
A serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused but know thou noble youth
The serpent that did sting thy fathers life
Now wears his crown
O my prophetic soul My uncle
Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
With witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
So to seducewon to his shameful lust
The will of my most seemingvirtuous queen
O Hamlet what a fallingoff was there
From me whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine
But virtue as it never will be moved
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
So lust though to a radiant angel linkd
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
And prey on garbage
But soft methinks I scent the morning air
Brief let me be Sleeping within my orchard
My custom always of the afternoon
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd like eager droppings into milk
The thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
And a most instant tetter barkd about
Most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
All my smooth body
Thus was I sleeping by a brothers hand
Of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
Unhouseld disappointed unaneld
No reckoning made but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head
O horrible O horrible most horrible
If thou hast nature in thee bear it not
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest
Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
To prick and sting her Fare thee well at once
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire
Adieu adieu Hamlet remember me
Exit
O all you host of heaven O earth what else
And shall I couple hell O fie Hold hold my heart
And you my sinews grow not instant old
But bear me stiffly up Remember thee
Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
Yea from the table of my memory
Ill wipe away all trivial fond records
All saws of books all forms all pressures past
That youth and observation copied there
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain
Unmixd with baser matter yes by heaven
O most pernicious woman
O villain villain smiling damned villain
My tablesmeet it is I set it down
That one may smile and smile and be a villain
At least Im sure it may be so in Denmark
Writing
So uncle there you are Now to my word
It is Adieu adieu remember me
I have sworn t
Within  My lord my lord
WithinLord Hamlet
WithinHeaven secure him
So be it
Within  Hillo ho ho my lord
Hillo ho ho boy come bird come
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
How ist my noble lord

No youll reveal it
Not I my lord by heaven
Nor I my lord
How say you then would heart of man once think it
But youll be secret
Ay by heaven my lord
Theres neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But hes an arrant knave
There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
To tell us this
Why right you are i the right
And so without more circumstance at all
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
You as your business and desire shall point you
For every man has business and desire
Such as it is and for mine own poor part
Look you Ill go pray
These are but wild and whirling words my lord
Im sorry they offend you heartily
Yes faith heartily
Theres no offence my lord
Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio
And much offence too Touching this vision here
It is an honest ghost that let me tell you
For your desire to know what is between us
Oermaster t as you may And now good friends
As you are friends scholars and soldiers
Give me one poor request
What ist my lord we will

Swear by my sword
Beneath  Swear
Hic et ubique then well shift our ground
Come hither gentlemen
And lay your hands again upon my sword
Never to speak of this that you have heard
Swear by my sword
Beneath  Swear
Well said old mole canst work i the earth so fast
A worthy pioner Once more remove good friends
O day and night but this is wondrous strange
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy But come
Here as before never so help you mercy
How strange or odd soeer I bear myself
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on
That you at such times seeing me never shall
With arms encumberd thus or this headshake
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
As Well well we know or We could an if we would
Or If we list to speak or There be an if they might
Or such ambiguous giving out to note
That you know aught of me this not to do
So grace and mercy at your most need help you Swear
Beneath  Swear
Rest rest perturbed spirit
They swear
So gentlemen
With all my love I do commend me to you
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do to express his love and friending to you
God willing shall not lack Let us go in together
And still your fingers on your lips I pray
The time is out of joint O cursed spite
That ever I was born to set it right
Nay come lets go together
Exeunt
Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO
Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
I will my lord
You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo
Before you visit him to make inquire
Of his behavior
My lord I did intend it
Marry well said very well said Look you sir
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris
And how and who what means and where they keep
What company at what expense and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it
Take you as twere some distant knowledge of him
As thus I know his father and his friends
And in part him  do you mark this Reynaldo
Ay very well my lord
And in part him but you may say not well
But ift be he I mean hes very wild
Addicted so and so and there put on him
What forgeries you please marry none so rank
As may dishonour him take heed of that
But sir such wanton wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty
As gaming my lord
Ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
Drabbing you may go so far
My lord that would dishonour him
Faith no as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him
That he is open to incontinency
Thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
A savageness in unreclaimed blood
Of general assault
But my good lord
Wherefore should you do this
Ay my lord
I would know that
Marry sir heres my drift
And I believe it is a fetch of wit
You laying these slight sullies on my son
As twere a thing a little soild i the working Mark you
Your party in converse him you would sound
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty be assured
He closes with you in this consequence
Good sir or so or friend or gentleman
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country
Very good my lord
And then sir does he thishe doeswhat was I
about to say By the mass I was about to say
something where did I leave
At closes in the consequence at friend or so
and gentleman
At closes in the consequence ay marry
He closes thus I know the gentleman
I saw him yesterday or t other day
Or then or then with such or such and as you say
There was a gaming there oertook ins rouse
There falling out at tennis or perchance
I saw him enter such a house of sale
Videlicet a brothel or so forth
See you now
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
With windlasses and with assays of bias
By indirections find directions out
So by my former lecture and advice
Shall you my son You have me have you not
My lord I have
God be wi you fare you well
Good my lord
Observe his inclination in yourself
I shall my lord
And let him ply his music
Well my lord
Farewell
Exit REYNALDO
Enter OPHELIA
How now Ophelia whats the matter
O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted
With what i the name of God
My lord as I was sewing in my closet
Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
No hat upon his head his stockings fould
Ungarterd and downgyved to his ancle
Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrorshe comes before me
Mad for thy love
My lord I do not know
But truly I do fear it
What said he
He took me by the wrist and held me hard
Then goes he to the length of all his arm
And with his other hand thus oer his brow
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it Long stayd he so
At last a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being that done he lets me go
And with his head over his shoulder turnd
He seemd to find his way without his eyes
For out o doors he went without their helps
And to the last bended their light on me
Come go with me I will go seek the king
This is the very ecstasy of love
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures I am sorry
What have you given him any hard words of late
No my good lord but as you did command
I did repel his fetters and denied
His access to me
That hath made him mad
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him I feard he did but trifle
And meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
By heaven it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion Come go we to the king
This must be known which being kept close might
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love
Exeunt
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and Attendants
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Moreover that we much did long to see you
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending Something have you heard
Of Hamlets transformation so call it
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was What it should be
More than his fathers death that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself
I cannot dream of I entreat you both
That being of so young days brought up with him
And sith so neighbourd to his youth and havior
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures and to gather
So much as from occasion you may glean
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
That opend lies within our remedy
Good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile
For the supply and profit of our hope
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a kings remembrance
Both your majesties
Might by the sovereign power you have of us
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty
But we both obey
And here give up ourselves in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet
To be commanded
Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son Go some of you
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
Pleasant and helpful to him
Ay amen

The ambassadors from Norway my good lord
Are joyfully returnd
Thou still hast been the father of good news
Have I my lord I assure my good liege
I hold my duty as I hold my soul
Both to my God and to my gracious king
And I do think or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do that I have found
The very cause of Hamlets lunacy
O speak of that that do I long to hear
Give first admittance to the ambassadors
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
Thyself do grace to them and bring them in
Exit POLONIUS
He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found
The head and source of all your sons distemper
I doubt it is no other but the main
His fathers death and our oerhasty marriage
Well we shall sift him
Reenter POLONIUS with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
Welcome my good friends
Say Voltimand what from our brother Norway
Most fair return of greetings and desires
Upon our first he sent out to suppress
His nephews levies which to him appeard
To be a preparation gainst the Polack
But better lookd into he truly found
It was against your highness whereat grieved
That so his sickness age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys
Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty
Whereon old Norway overcome with joy
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
And his commission to employ those soldiers
So levied as before against the Polack
With an entreaty herein further shown
Giving a paper
That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down
It likes us well
And at our more considerd time well read
Answer and think upon this business
Meantime we thank you for your welltook labour
Go to your rest at night well feast together
Most welcome home
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
This business is well ended
My liege and madam to expostulate
What majesty should be what duty is
Why day is day night night and time is time
Were nothing but to waste night day and time
Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
I will be brief your noble son is mad
Mad call I it for to define true madness
What ist but to be nothing else but mad
But let that go
More matter with less art
Madam I swear I use no art at all
That he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
And pity tis tis true a foolish figure
But farewell it for I will use no art
Mad let us grant him then and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect
Or rather say the cause of this defect
For this effect defective comes by cause
Thus it remains and the remainder thus Perpend
I have a daughterhave while she is mine
Who in her duty and obedience mark
Hath given me this now gather and surmise
Reads
To the celestial and my souls idol the most
beautified Ophelia
Thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is
a vile phrase but you shall hear Thus
Reads
In her excellent white bosom these  and c
Came this from Hamlet to her
Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful
Reads
Doubt thou the stars are fire
Doubt that the sun doth move
Doubt truth to be a liar
But never doubt I love
O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers
I have not art to reckon my groans but that
I love thee best O most best believe it Adieu
Thine evermore most dear lady whilst
this machine is to him HAMLET
This in obedience hath my daughter shown me
And more above hath his solicitings
As they fell out by time by means and place
All given to mine ear
But how hath she
Received his love
What do you think of me
As of a man faithful and honourable
I would fain prove so But what might you think
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
As I perceived it I must tell you that
Before my daughter told mewhat might you
Or my dear majesty your queen here think
If I had playd the desk or tablebook
Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
Or lookd upon this love with idle sight
What might you think No I went round to work
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak
Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star
This must not be and then I precepts gave her
That she should lock herself from his resort
Admit no messengers receive no tokens
Which done she took the fruits of my advice
And he repulseda short tale to make
Fell into a sadness then into a fast
Thence to a watch thence into a weakness
Thence to a lightness and by this declension
Into the madness wherein now he raves
And all we mourn for
Do you think tis this
It may be very likely
Hath there been such a timeId fain know that
That I have positively said Tis so
When it proved otherwise
Not that I know
Pointing to his head and shoulder
Take this from this if this be otherwise
If circumstances lead me I will find
Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
Within the centre
How may we try it further
You know sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby
So he does indeed
At such a time Ill loose my daughter to him
Be you and I behind an arras then
Mark the encounter if he love her not
And be not from his reason falln thereon
Let me be no assistant for a state
But keep a farm and carters
We will try it
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
Away I do beseech you both away
Ill board him presently
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE and Attendants
Enter HAMLET reading
O give me leave
How does my good Lord Hamlet
Well Godamercy
Do you know me my lord
Excellent well you are a fishmonger
Not I my lord
Then I would you were so honest a man
Honest my lord
Ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand
Thats very true my lord
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a
god kissing carrionHave you a daughter
I have my lord
Let her not walk i the sun conception is a
blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
Friend look to t
Aside  How say you by that Still harping on my
daughter yet he knew me not at first he said I
was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love very near this Ill speak to him again
What do you read my lord
Words words words
What is the matter my lord
Between who
I mean the matter that you read my lord
Slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards that their faces are
wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and
plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit together with most weak hams all which sir
though I most powerfully and potently believe yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for
yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab
you could go backward
Aside  Though this be madness yet there is method
in t Will you walk out of the air my lord
Into my grave
Indeed that is out o the air
Aside
How pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness
that often madness hits on which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of I will
leave him and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughterMy honourable
lord I will most humbly take my leave of you
You cannot sir take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal except my life except
my life except my life
Fare you well my lord
These tedious old fools
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet there he is
To POLONIUS  God save you sir
Exit POLONIUS
My honoured lord
My most dear lord
My excellent good friends How dost thou
Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both
As the indifferent children of the earth
Happy in that we are not overhappy
On fortunes cap we are not the very button
Nor the soles of her shoe
Neither my lord
Then you live about her waist or in the middle of
her favours
Faith her privates we
In the secret parts of fortune O most true she
is a strumpet Whats the news
None my lord but that the worlds grown honest
Then is doomsday near but your news is not true
Let me question more in particular what have you
my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune
that she sends you to prison hither
Prison my lord
Denmarks a prison
Then is the world one
A goodly one in which there are many confines
wards and dungeons Denmark being one o the worst
We think not so my lord
Why then tis none to you for there is nothing
either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me
it is a prison
Why then your ambition makes it one tis too
narrow for your mind
O God I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space were it not that I
have bad dreams
Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
A dream itself is but a shadow
Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadows shadow
Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars shadows Shall we
to the court for by my fay I cannot reason
Well wait upon you
No such matter I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants for to speak to you like an honest
man I am most dreadfully attended But in the
beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore
To visit you my lord no other occasion
Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I
thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for Is it
your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come
deal justly with me come come nay speak
What should we say my lord
Why any thing but to the purpose You were sent
for and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
I know the good king and queen have sent for you
To what end my lord
That you must teach me But let me conjure you by
the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of
our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved
love and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal be even and direct with me
whether you were sent for or no
Aside to GUILDENSTERN  What say you
Aside  Nay then I have an eye of youIf you
love me hold not off
My lord we were sent for
I will tell you why so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather I have of latebut
wherefore I know notlost all my mirth forgone all
custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame the
earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most
excellent canopy the air look you this brave
oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire why it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
What a piece of work is a man how noble in reason
how infinite in faculty in form and moving how
in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the
world the paragon of animals And yet to me
what is this quintessence of dust man delights not
me no nor woman neither though by your smiling
you seem to say so
My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
Why did you laugh then when I said man delights not me
To think my lord if you delight not in man what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you we coted them on the way and hither are they
coming to offer you service
He that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty
shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target the lover shall not
sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part
in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall
say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt
fort What players are they
Even those you were wont to take delight in the
tragedians of the city
How chances it they travel their residence both
in reputation and profit was better both ways
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city are they so followed
No indeed are they not
How comes it do they grow rusty
Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but
there is sir an aery of children little eyases
that cry out on the top of question and are most
tyrannically clapped fort these are now the
fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they
call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goosequills and dare scarce come thither
What are they children who maintains em how are
they escoted Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing will they not say
afterwards if they should grow themselves to common
playersas it is most like if their means are no
bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim against their own succession
Faith there has been much to do on both sides and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy there was for a while no money bid
for argument unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question
Ist possible
O there has been much throwing about of brains
Do the boys carry it away
Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too
It is not very strange for mine uncle is king of
Denmark and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived give twenty forty fifty an
hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
Sblood there is something in this more than
natural if philosophy could find it out
Flourish of trumpets within
There are the players
Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands
come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb
lest my extent to the players which I tell you
must show fairly outward should more appear like
entertainment than yours You are welcome but my
unclefather and auntmother are deceived
In what my dear lord
I am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw

You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad
to see thee well Welcome good friends O my old
friend thy face is valenced since I saw thee last
comest thou to beard me in Denmark What my young

nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like
apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the
ring Masters you are all welcome Well een
tot like French falconers fly at any thing we see
well have a speech straight come give us a taste
of your quality come a passionate speech
What speech my lord
I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was
play I remember pleased not the million twas
caviare to the general but it wasas I received
it and others whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of minean excellent play well
modesty as cunning I remember one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation but called it an
honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very
much more handsome than fine One speech in it I
chiefly loved twas Aeneas tale to Dido and
thereabout of it especially where he speaks of
Priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin
at this line let me see let me see
The rugged Pyrrhus like the Hyrcanian beast
it is not soit begins with Pyrrhus
The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms
Black as his purpose did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse
Hath now this dread and black complexion smeard
With heraldry more dismal head to foot
Now is he total gules horridly trickd
With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
Baked and impasted with the parching streets
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lords murder roasted in wrath and fire
And thus oersized with coagulate gore
With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks
So proceed you
Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and
good discretion
Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks his antique sword
Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
Repugnant to command unequal matchd
Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls Then senseless Ilium
Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam seemd i the air to stick
So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
And like a neutral to his will and matter
Did nothing
But as we often see against some storm
A silence in the heavens the rack stand still
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus pause
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork
And never did the Cyclops hammers fall
On Marss armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam
Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods
In general synod take away her power
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
As low as to the fiends
This is too long
It shall to the barbers with your beard Prithee
say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he
sleeps say on come to Hecuba
But who O who had seen the mobled queen
The mobled queen
Thats good mobled queen is good
Run barefoot up and down threatening the flames
With bisson rheum a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood and for a robe
About her lank and all oerteemed loins
A blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
Who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd
Gainst Fortunes state would treason have
pronounced
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husbands limbs
The instant burst of clamour that she made
Unless things mortal move them not at all
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
And passion in the gods
Look whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears ins eyes Pray you no more
Tis well Ill have thee speak out the rest soon
Good my lord will you see the players well
bestowed Do you hear let them be well used for
time after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live
My lord I will use them according to their desert
Gods bodykins man much better use every man
after his desert and who should scape whipping
Use them after your own honour and dignity the less
they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
Take them in
Come sirs
Follow him friends well hear a play tomorrow
Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First
Dost thou hear me old friend can you play the
Murder of Gonzago
Ay my lord
Well hat tomorrow night You could for a need
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which
I would set down and insert int could you not
Ay my lord
Very well Follow that lord and look you mock him
not
Exit First Player
My good friends Ill leave you till night you are
welcome to Elsinore
Good my lord
Ay so God be wi ye
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Now I am alone
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I
Is it not monstrous that this player here
But in a fiction in a dream of passion
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wannd
A broken voice and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit and all for nothing
For Hecuba
Whats Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
That he should weep for her What would he do
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech
Make mad the guilty and appal the free
Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I
A dull and muddymettled rascal peak
Like Johnadreams unpregnant of my cause
And can say nothing no not for a king
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damnd defeat was made Am I a coward
Who calls me villain breaks my pate across
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
Tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
As deep as to the lungs who does me this
Ha
Swounds I should take it for it cannot be
But I am pigeonliverd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
O vengeance
Why what an ass am I This is most brave
That I the son of a dear father murderd
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
Must like a whore unpack my heart with words
And fall acursing like a very drab
A scullion
Fie upont foh About my brain I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Been struck so to the soul that presently
For murder though it have no tongue will speak
With most miraculous organ Ill have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle Ill observe his looks
Ill tent him to the quick if he but blench
I know my course The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy
As he is very potent with such spirits
Abuses me to damn me Ill have grounds
More relative than this the play s the thing
Wherein Ill catch the conscience of the king

And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
But from what cause he will by no means speak
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state
Did he receive you well
Most like a gentleman
But with much forcing of his disposition
Niggard of question but of our demands
Most free in his reply
Did you assay him
To any pastime
Madam it so fell out that certain players
We oerraught on the way of these we told him
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it they are about the court
And as I think they have already order
This night to play before him
Tis most true
And he beseechd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter
With all my heart and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined
Good gentlemen give him a further edge
And drive his purpose on to these delights
We shall my lord
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Sweet Gertrude leave us too
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither
That he as twere by accident may here
Affront Ophelia
Her father and myself lawful espials
Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
We may of their encounter frankly judge
And gather by him as he is behaved
If t be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for
I shall obey you
And for your part Ophelia I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlets wildness so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again
To both your honours
Madam I wish it may

That show of such an exercise may colour

Tis too much provedthat with devotions visage

Aside          O tis too true
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
The harlots cheek beautied with plastering art
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word
O heavy burthen
I hear him coming lets withdraw my lord
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
Enter HAMLET
To be or not to be that is the question
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them To die to sleep
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wishd To die to sleep
To sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause theres the respect
That makes calamity of so long life
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
The pangs of despised love the laws delay
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
To grunt and sweat under a weary life
But that the dread of something after death
The undiscoverd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
Be all my sins rememberd
Good my lord
How does your honour for this many a day
I humbly thank you well well well
My lord I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to redeliver
I pray you now receive them
No not I
I never gave you aught
My honourd lord you know right well you did
And with them words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich their perfume lost
Take these again for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
There my lord
Ha ha are you honest
My lord
Are you fair
What means your lordship
That if you be honest and fair your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty
Could beauty my lord have better commerce than
with honesty
Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the
time gives it proof I did love you once
Indeed my lord you made me believe so
You should not have believed me for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it I loved you not
I was the more deceived

O what a noble mind is here oerthrown
The courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword
The expectancy and rose of the fair state
The glass of fashion and the mould of form
The observed of all observers quite quite down
And I of ladies most deject and wretched
That suckd the honey of his music vows
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason
Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
That unmatchd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me
To have seen what I have seen see what I see
Reenter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
Love his affections do not that way tend
Nor what he spake though it lackd form a little
Was not like madness Theres something in his soul
Oer which his melancholy sits on brood
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger which for to prevent
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down he shall with speed to England
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This somethingsettled matter in his heart
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself What think you ont
It shall do well but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
We heard it all My lord do as you please
But if you hold it fit after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief let her be round with him
And Ill be placed so please you in the ear
Of all their conference If she find him not
To England send him or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think
It shall be so
Madness in great ones must not unwatchd go
Exeunt
Enter HAMLET and Players
Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to
you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it
as many of your players do I had as lief the
towncrier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand thus but use all gently
for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say
the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness O it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to
very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise I would have such
a fellow whipped for oerdoing Termagant it
outherods Herod pray you avoid it
I warrant your honour
Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion
the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing whose end both at the
first and now was and is to hold as twere the
mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
scorn her own image and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure Now this overdone
or come tardy off though it make the unskilful
laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
oerweigh a whole theatre of others O there be
players that I have seen play and heard others
praise and that highly not to speak it profanely
that neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
natures journeymen had made men and not made them
well they imitated humanity so abominably
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us
sir
O reform it altogether And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them
for there be of them that will themselves laugh to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too though in the mean time some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered
thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it Go make you ready

Enter HORATIO
Here sweet lord at your service
Horatio thou art een as just a man
As eer my conversation coped withal
O my dear lord
Nay do not think I flatter
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flatterd
No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish her election
Hath seald thee for herself for thou hast been
As one in suffering all that suffers nothing
A man that fortunes buffets and rewards
Hast taen with equal thanks and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
That they are not a pipe for fortunes finger
To sound what stop she please Give me that man
That is not passions slave and I will wear him
In my hearts core ay in my heart of heart
As I do theeSomething too much of this
There is a play tonight before the king
Which I have told thee of my fathers death
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech
It is a damned ghost that we have seen
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcans stithy Give him heedful note
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming
Well my lord
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
And scape detecting I will pay the theft
They are coming to the play I must be idle
Get you a place

Lying down at OPHELIAs feet

Thats a fair thought to lie between maids legs
What is my lord
Nothing
You are merry my lord

Ay my lord
O God your only jigmaker What should a man do
but be merry for look you how cheerfully my
mother looks and my father died within these two hours
Nay tis twice two months my lord
So long Nay then let the devil wear black for
Ill have a suit of sables O heavens die two
months ago and not forgotten yet Then theres

Ay or any show that youll show him be not you

Exit
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
Tis brief my lord
As womans love
Enter two Players King and Queen
Full thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone round
Neptunes salt wash and Tellus orbed ground
And thirty dozen moons with borrowd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count oer ere love be done
But woe is me you are so sick of late
So far from cheer and from your former state
That I distrust you Yet though I distrust
Discomfort you my lord it nothing must
For womens fear and love holds quantity
In neither aught or in extremity
Now what my love is proof hath made you know
And as my love is sized my fear is so
Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
Where little fears grow great great love grows there
Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too
My operant powers their functions leave to do
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
Honourd beloved and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou
O confound the rest
Such love must needs be treason in my breast
In second husband let me be accurst
None wed the second but who killd the first
Aside  Wormwood wormwood
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift but none of love
A second time I kill my husband dead
When second husband kisses me in bed
I do believe you think what now you speak
But what we do determine oft we break
Purpose is but the slave to memory
Of violent birth but poor validity
Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
But fall unshaken when they mellow be
Most necessary tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
What to ourselves in passion we propose
The passion ending doth the purpose lose
The violence of either grief or joy
Where joy most revels grief doth most lament
Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
This world is not for aye nor tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change
For tis a question left us yet to prove
Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
The great man down you mark his favourite flies
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend
For who not needs shall never lack a friend
And who in want a hollow friend doth try
Directly seasons him his enemy
But orderly to end where I begun
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown
Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
So think thou wilt no second husband wed
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
Sport and repose lock from me day and night
To desperation turn my trust and hope
An anchors cheer in prison be my scope
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
If once a widow ever I be wife
If she should break it now
Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile
My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep
Sleeps
Sleep rock thy brain
And never come mischance between us twain

Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you
Sir a whole history
The king sir
Ay sir what of him
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered
With drink sir
No my lord rather with choler
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor for for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler
Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair
I am tame sir pronounce
The queen your mother in most great affliction of
spirit hath sent me to you
You are welcome
Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right
breed If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer I will do your mothers
commandment if not your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business
Sir I cannot
What my lord
Make you a wholesome answer my wits diseased but
sir such answer as I can make you shall command
or rather as you say my mother therefore no
more but to the matter my mother you say
Then thus she says your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration
O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mothers
admiration Impart
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you
go to bed
We shall obey were she ten times our mother Have
you any further trade with us
My lord you once did love me
So I do still by these pickers and stealers
Good my lord what is your cause of distemper you
do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if
you deny your griefs to your friend
Sir I lack advancement
How can that be when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark
Ay but sir While the grass growsthe proverb

My lord I cannot
I pray you
Believe me I cannot

Tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with
your lingers and thumb give it breath with your
mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
Look you these are the stops
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony I have not the skill
Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of
me You would play upon me you would seem to know
my stops you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass and there is much music
excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot

easier to be played on than a pipe Call me what
instrument you will though you can fret me yet you
cannot play upon me

Methinks it is like a weasel

And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on Soft now to my mother
O heart lose not thy nature let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom

And he to England shall along with you

Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies
We will ourselves provide
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty
The single and peculiar life is bound
With all the strength and armour of the mind
To keep itself from noyance but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many The cease of majesty
Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
Whats near it with it it is a massy wheel
Fixd on the summit of the highest mount
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoind which when it falls
Each small annexment petty consequence
Attends the boisterous ruin Never alone
Did the king sigh but with a general groan
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage
For we will fetters put upon this fear
Which now goes too freefooted
We will haste us

Since nature makes them partial should oerhear
The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege
Ill call upon you ere you go to bed
And tell you what I know
Thanks dear my lord
Exit POLONIUS
O my offence is rank it smells to heaven
It hath the primal eldest curse upont
A brothers murder Pray can I not
Though inclination be as sharp as will
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
And like a man to double business bound
I stand in pause where I shall first begin
And both neglect What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brothers blood
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence
And whats in prayer but this twofold force
To be forestalled ere we come to fall
Or pardond being down Then Ill look up
My fault is past But O what form of prayer
Can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder
That cannot be since I am still possessd
Of those effects for which I did the murder
My crown mine own ambition and my queen
May one be pardond and retain the offence
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offences gilded hand may shove by justice
And oft tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law but tis not so above
In his true nature and we ourselves compelld
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
To give in evidence What then what rests
Try what repentance can what can it not
Yet what can it when one can not repent
O wretched state O bosom black as death
O limed soul that struggling to be free
Art more engaged Help angels Make assay
Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
All may be well
Retires and kneels

Now might I do it pat now he is praying
And now Ill dot And so he goes to heaven
And so am I revenged That would be scannd
A villain kills my father and for that
I his sole son do this same villain send
To heaven
O this is hire and salary not revenge
He took my father grossly full of bread
With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven
But in our circumstance and course of thought
Tis heavy with him and am I then revenged
To take him in the purging of his soul
When he is fit and seasond for his passage
No
Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
When he is drunk asleep or in his rage
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed
That has no relish of salvation int
Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
And that his soul may be as damnd and black
As hell whereto it goes My mother stays
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days

Rising  My words fly up my thoughts remain below
Words without thoughts never to heaven go

Now mother whats the matter
Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
Mother you have my father much offended
Come come you answer with an idle tongue
Go go you question with a wicked tongue
Why how now Hamlet
Whats the matter now
Have you forgot me
No by the rood not so
You are the queen your husbands brothers wife
Andwould it were not soyou are my mother
Nay then Ill set those to you that can speak
Come come and sit you down you shall not budge
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you
What wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me
Help help ho
Behind  What ho help help help
Drawing  How now a rat Dead for a ducat dead
Makes a pass through the arras
Behind  O I am slain
Falls and dies
O me what hast thou done
Nay I know not
Is it the king
O what a rash and bloody deed is this
A bloody deed almost as bad good mother
As kill a king and marry with his brother
As kill a king
Ay lady twas my word
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
I took thee for thy better take thy fortune
Thou findst to be too busy is some danger
Leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
And let me wring your heart for so I shall
If it be made of penetrable stuff
If damned custom have not brassd it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense
What have I done that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty
Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there makes marriagevows
As false as dicers oaths O such a deed
The very soul and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words heavens face doth glow
Yea this solidity and compound mass
With tristful visage as against the doom
That roars so loud and thunders in the index
Look here upon this picture and on this
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers
See what a grace was seated on this brow
Hyperions curls the front of Jove himself
An eye like Mars to threaten and command
A station like the herald Mercury
Newlighted on a heavenkissing hill
A combination and a form indeed
Where every god did seem to set his seal
To give the world assurance of a man
This was your husband Look you now what follows
Here is your husband like a mildewd ear
Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
And batten on this moor Ha have you eyes
You cannot call it love for at your age
The heyday in the blood is tame its humble
And waits upon the judgment and what judgment
Would step from this to this Sense sure you have
Else could you not have motion but sure that sense
Is apoplexd for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstasy was neer so thralld
But it reserved some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference What devil wast
That thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind
Eyes without feeling feeling without sight
Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope
O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell
If thou canst mutine in a matrons bones
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
And melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge
And reason panders will
O Hamlet speak no more
Thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct
Nay but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
Stewd in corruption honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty
O speak to me no more
These words like daggers enter in mine ears
No more sweet Hamlet
A murderer and a villain
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord a vice of kings
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket
No more
A king of shreds and patches
Enter Ghost
Save me and hover oer me with your wings
You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure
Alas hes mad
Do you not come your tardy son to chide
That lapsed in time and passion lets go by
Do not forget this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
But look amazement on thy mother sits
O step between her and her fighting soul
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
Speak to her Hamlet
How is it with you lady
Alas how ist with you
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
And as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm
Your bedded hair like life in excrements
Starts up and stands on end O gentle son
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look
On him on him Look you how pale he glares
His form and cause conjoind preaching to stones
Would make them capable Do not look upon me
My stern effects then what I have to do
Will want true colour tears perchance for blood
To whom do you speak this
Do you see nothing there
Nothing at all yet all that is I see
Nor did you nothing hear
No nothing but ourselves
Why look you there look how it steals away
My father in his habit as he lived
Look where he goes even now out at the portal
Exit Ghost
This the very coinage of your brain
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in
Ecstasy
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
And makes as healthful music it is not madness
That I have utterd bring me to the test
And I the matter will reword which madness
Would gambol from Mother for love of grace
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul
That not your trespass but my madness speaks
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place
Whilst rank corruption mining all within
Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven
Repent whats past avoid what is to come
And do not spread the compost on the weeds
To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
O throw away the worser part of it
And live the purer with the other half
Good night but go not to mine uncles bed
Assume a virtue if you have it not
That monster custom who all sense doth eat
Of habits devil is angel yet in this
He likewise gives a frock or livery
That aptly is put on Refrain tonight
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence the next more easy
For use almost can change the stamp of nature
And either           the devil or throw him out
With wondrous potency Once more good night
And when you are desirous to be blessd
Ill blessing beg of you For this same lord
Pointing to POLONIUS
I do repent but heaven hath pleased it so
To punish me with this and this with me
That I must be their scourge and minister
I will bestow him and will answer well
The death I gave him So again good night
I must be cruel only to be kind
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind
One word more good lady
What shall I do
Not this by no means that I bid you do
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
And let him for a pair of reechy kisses
Or paddling in your neck with his damnd fingers
Make you to ravel all this matter out
That I essentially am not in madness
But mad in craft Twere good you let him know
For who thats but a queen fair sober wise
Would from a paddock from a bat a gib
Such dear concernings hide who would do so
No in despite of sense and secrecy
Unpeg the basket on the houses top
Let the birds fly and like the famous ape
To try conclusions in the basket creep
And break your own neck down
Be thou assured if words be made of breath
And breath of life I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me
I must to England you know that
Alack
I had forgot tis so concluded on
Theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows
Whom I will trust as I will adders fangd
They bear the mandate they must sweep my way
And marshal me to knavery Let it work
For tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines
And blow them at the moon O tis most sweet
When in one line two crafts directly meet
This man shall set me packing
Ill lug the guts into the neighbour room
Mother good night Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still most secret and most grave
Who was in life a foolish prating knave
Come sir to draw toward an end with you
Good night mother

Theres matter in these sighs these profound heaves
You must translate tis fit we understand them
Where is your son
Bestow this place on us a little while
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Ah my good lord what have I seen tonight
What Gertrude How does Hamlet
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Which is the mightier in his lawless fit
Behind the arras hearing something stir
Whips out his rapier cries A rat a rat
And in this brainish apprehension kills
The unseen good old man
O heavy deed
It had been so with us had we been there
His liberty is full of threats to all
To you yourself to us to every one
Alas how shall this bloody deed be answerd
It will be laid to us whose providence
Should have kept short restraind and out of haunt
This mad young man but so much was our love
We would not understand what was most fit
But like the owner of a foul disease
To keep it from divulging let it feed
Even on the pith of Life Where is he gone
To draw apart the body he hath killd
Oer whom his very madness like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base
Shows itself pure he weeps for what is done
O Gertrude come away
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
But we will ship him hence and this vile deed
We must with all our majesty and skill
Both countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern
Reenter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Friends both go join you with some further aid
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
And from his mothers closet hath he draggd him
Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
Into the chapel I pray you haste in this
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Come Gertrude well call up our wisest friends
And let them know both what we mean to do
And whats untimely done O come away
My soul is full of discord and dismay
Exeunt
Enter HAMLET
Safely stowed
ROSENCRANTZ
GUILDENSTERN
Within  Hamlet Lord Hamlet
What noise who calls on Hamlet
O here they come
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
What have you done my lord with the dead body
Compounded it with dust whereto tis kin
Tell us where tis that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel
Do not believe it
Believe what
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own
Besides to be demanded of a sponge what
replication should be made by the son of a king
Take you me for a sponge my lord
Ay sir that soaks up the kings countenance his
rewards his authorities But such officers do the
king best service in the end he keeps them like
an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to
be last swallowed when he needs what you have
gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you
shall be dry again
I understand you not my lord
I am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear
My lord you must tell us where the body is and go
with us to the king
The body is with the king but the king is not with
the body The king is a thing
A thing my lord
Of nothing bring me to him Hide fox and all after
Exeunt
Enter KING CLAUDIUS attended
I have sent to seek him and to find the body
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
Who like not in their judgment but their eyes
And where tis so the offenders scourge is weighd
But never the offence To bear all smooth and even
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved
Or not at all
Enter ROSENCRANTZ
How now what hath befalln
Where the dead body is bestowd my lord
We cannot get from him
But where is he
Without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
Bring him before us
Ho Guildenstern bring in my lord
Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN
Now Hamlet wheres Polonius
At supper
At supper where
Not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain
convocation of politic worms are een at him Your
worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all
creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for
maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service two dishes but to one table
thats the end
Alas alas
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm
What dost you mean by this
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar
Where is Polonius
In heaven send hither to see if your messenger
find him not there seek him i the other place
yourself But indeed if you find him not within
this month you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby
Go seek him there
To some Attendants
He will stay till ye come
Exeunt Attendants
Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety
Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast donemust send thee hence
With fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself
The bark is ready and the wind at help
The associates tend and every thing is bent
For England
For England
Ay Hamlet
Good
So is it if thou knewst our purposes
I see a cherub that sees them But come for
England Farewell dear mother
Thy loving father Hamlet
My mother father and mother is man and wife man
and wife is one flesh and so my mother Come for England
Exit
Follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard
Delay it not Ill have him hence tonight
Away for every thing is seald and done
That else leans on the affair pray you make haste
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
And England if my love thou holdst at aught
As my great power thereof may give thee sense
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword and thy free awe
Pays homage to usthou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process which imports at full
By letters congruing to that effect
The present death of Hamlet Do it England
For like the hectic in my blood he rages
And thou must cure me till I know tis done
Howeer my haps my joys were neer begun
Exit
Enter FORTINBRAS a Captain and Soldiers marching
Go captain from me greet the Danish king
Tell him that by his licence Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom You know the rendezvous
If that his majesty would aught with us
We shall express our duty in his eye
And let him know so
I will dot my lord
Go softly on
Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers
Enter HAMLET ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and others
Good sir whose powers are these
They are of Norway sir
How purposed sir I pray you
Against some part of Poland
Who commands them sir
The nephews to old Norway Fortinbras
Goes it against the main of Poland sir
Or for some frontier
Truly to speak and with no addition
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name
To pay five ducats five I would not farm it
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate should it be sold in fee
Why then the Polack never will defend it
Yes it is already garrisond
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace
That inward breaks and shows no cause without
Why the man dies I humbly thank you sir
God be wi you sir
Exit
Wilt please you go my lord
Ill be with you straight go a little before
Exeunt all except HAMLET
How all occasions do inform against me
And spur my dull revenge What is a man
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
Sure he that made us with such large discourse
Looking before and after gave us not
That capability and godlike reason
To fust in us unused Now whether it be
Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event
A thought which quarterd hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward I do not know
Why yet I live to say This things to do
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To dot Examples gross as earth exhort me
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince
Whose spirit with divine ambition puffd
Makes mouths at the invisible event
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune death and danger dare
Even for an eggshell Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honours at the stake How stand I then
That have a father killd a mother staind
Excitements of my reason and my blood
And let all sleep while to my shame I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men
That for a fantasy and trick of fame
Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain O from this time forth
My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
Exit
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE HORATIO and a Gentleman
I will not speak with her
Her mood will needs be pitied
What would she have
She speaks much of her father says she hears
Theres tricks i the world and hems and beats her heart
Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
That carry but half sense her speech is nothing
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection they aim at it
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
Which as her winks and nods and gestures
yield them
Indeed would make one think there might be thought
Though nothing sure yet much unhappily
Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds
Let her come in
Exit HORATIO
To my sick soul as sins true nature is
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
So full of artless jealousy is guilt
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt
Reenter HORATIO with OPHELIA
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark
How now Ophelia
Sings
How should I your true love know
From another one
By his cockle hat and staff
And his sandal shoon
Alas sweet lady what imports this song
Say you nay pray you mark
Sings
He is dead and gone lady

At his head a grassgreen turf
At his heels a stone
Nay but Ophelia
Pray you mark
Sings
White his shroud as the mountain snow
Enter KING CLAUDIUS
Alas look here my lord
Sings
Larded with sweet flowers
Which bewept to the grave did go
With truelove showers
How do you pretty lady
Well God ild you They say the owl was a bakers

Conceit upon her father

Sings
Tomorrow is Saint Valentines day

Pretty Ophelia

Sings
By Gis and by Saint Charity
Alack and fie for shame
Young men will dot if they come tot
By cock they are to blame
Quoth she before you tumbled me
You promised me to wed
So would I ha done by yonder sun
An thou hadst not come to my bed
How long hath she been thus
I hope all will be well We must be patient but I
cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him
i the cold ground My brother shall know of it
and so I thank you for your good counsel Come my
coach Good night ladies good night sweet ladies
good night good night
Exit
Follow her close give her good watch
I pray you
Exit HORATIO
O this is the poison of deep grief it springs
All from her fathers death O Gertrude Gertrude
When sorrows come they come not single spies
But in battalions First her father slain
Next your son gone and he most violent author
Of his own just remove the people muddied
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
For good Polonius death and we have done but greenly
In huggermugger to inter him poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
Last and as much containing as all these
Her brother is in secret come from France
Feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his fathers death
Wherein necessity of matter beggard
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this
Like to a murderingpiece in many places
Gives me superfluous death
A noise within
Alack what noise is this
Where are my Switzers Let them guard the door
Enter another Gentleman
What is the matter
Save yourself my lord
The ocean overpeering of his list
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than young Laertes in a riotous head
Oerbears your officers The rabble call him lord
And as the world were now but to begin
Antiquity forgot custom not known
The ratifiers and props of every word
They cry Choose we Laertes shall be king
Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
Laertes shall be king Laertes king
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry
O this is counter you false Danish dogs
The doors are broke
Noise within
Enter LAERTES armed Danes following
Where is this king Sirs stand you all without
No lets come in
I pray you give me leave
We will we will
They retire without the door
I thank you keep the door O thou vile king
Give me my father
Calmly good Laertes
That drop of blood thats calm proclaims me bastard
Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother
What is the cause Laertes
That thy rebellion looks so giantlike
Let him go Gertrude do not fear our person
Theres such divinity doth hedge a king
That treason can but peep to what it would
Why thou art thus incensed Let him go Gertrude
Speak man
Where is my father
Dead
But not by him
Let him demand his fill
How came he dead Ill not be juggled with
To hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
I dare damnation To this point I stand
That both the worlds I give to negligence
Let come what comes only Ill be revenged
Most thoroughly for my father
Who shall stay you
My will not all the world
And for my means Ill husband them so well
They shall go far with little
Good Laertes
If you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear fathers death ist writ in your revenge
That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
Winner and loser
None but his enemies
Will you know them then
To his good friends thus wide Ill ope my arms
And like the kind liferendering pelican
Repast them with my blood
Why now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman
That I am guiltless of your fathers death
And am most sensible in grief for it
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye
Within                Let her come in
How now what noise is that
Reenter OPHELIA
O heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May
Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
O heavens ist possible a young maids wits
Should be as moral as an old mans life
Nature is fine in love and where tis fine
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves
Sings
They bore him barefaced on the bier
Hey non nonny nonny hey nonny
And in his grave raind many a tear
Fare you well my dove
Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
It could not move thus
Sings
You must sing adown adown
An you call him adowna
O how the wheel becomes it It is the false
steward that stole his masters daughter
This nothings more than matter
Theres rosemary thats for remembrance pray
love remember and there is pansies thats for thoughts
A document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
Theres fennel for you and columbines theres rue
for you and heres some for me we may call it
herbgrace o Sundays O you must wear your rue with
a difference Theres a daisy I would give you
some violets but they withered all when my father
died they say he made a good end
Sings
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy
Thought and affliction passion hell itself
She turns to favour and to prettiness
Sings
And will he not come again
And will he not come again
No no he is dead
Go to thy deathbed
He never will come again
His beard was as white as snow
All flaxen was his poll
He is gone he is gone
And we cast away moan
God ha mercy on his soul
And of all Christian souls I pray God God be wi ye
Exit
Do you see this O God
Laertes I must commune with your grief
Or you deny me right Go but apart
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
And they shall hear and judge twixt you and me
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us touchd we will our kingdom give
Our crown our life and all that we can ours
Be you content to lend your patience to us
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content
Let this be so
His means of death his obscure funeral
No trophy sword nor hatchment oer his bones
No noble rite nor formal ostentation
Cry to be heard as twere from heaven to earth
That I must callt in question
So you shall
And where the offence is let the great axe fall
I pray you go with me
Exeunt
Enter HORATIO and a Servant
What are they that would speak with me
Sailors sir they say they have letters for you
Let them come in
Exit Servant
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet
Enter Sailors
God bless you sir
Let him bless thee too
He shall sir ant please him Theres a letter for
you sir it comes from the ambassador that was
bound for England if your name be Horatio as I am
let to know it is
Reads  Horatio when thou shalt have overlooked
this give these fellows some means to the king
they have letters for him Ere we were two days old
at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on
a compelled valour and in the grapple I boarded
them on the instant they got clear of our ship so
I alone became their prisoner They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they
did I am to do a good turn for them Let the king
have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter These good fellows will bring thee
where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England of them I have much to tell
thee Farewell
He that thou knowest thine HAMLET
Come I will make you way for these your letters
And dot the speedier that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them
Exeunt
Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal
And you must put me in your heart for friend
Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life
It well appears but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats
So crimeful and so capital in nature
As by your safety wisdom all things else
You mainly were stirrd up
O for two special reasons
Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd
But yet to me they are strong The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks and for myself
My virtue or my plague be it either which
Shes so conjunctive to my life and soul
That as the star moves not but in his sphere
I could not but by her The other motive
Why to a public count I might not go
Is the great love the general gender bear him
Who dipping all his faults in their affection
Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
Too slightly timberd for so loud a wind
Would have reverted to my bow again
And not where I had aimd them
And so have I a noble father lost
A sister driven into desperate terms
Whose worth if praises may go back again
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections but my revenge will come
Break not your sleeps for that you must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more
I loved your father and we love ourself
And that I hope will teach you to imagine
Enter a Messenger
How now what news
Letters my lord from Hamlet
This to your majesty this to the queen
From Hamlet who brought them
Sailors my lord they say I saw them not
They were given me by Claudio he received them
Of him that brought them
Laertes you shall hear them Leave us
Exit Messenger
Reads
High and mighty You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your
pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return                  HAMLET
What should this mean Are all the rest come back
Or is it some abuse and no such thing
Know you the hand
And in a postscript here he says alone
Can you advise me
Im lost in it my lord But let him come
It warms the very sickness in my heart
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
Thus didest thou
If it be so Laertes
As how should it be so how otherwise
Will you be ruled by me
Ay my lord
So you will not oerrule me to a peace
To thine own peace If he be now returnd
As checking at his voyage and that he means
No more to undertake it I will work him
To an exploit now ripe in my device
Under the which he shall not choose but fall
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
And call it accident
My lord I will be ruled
The rather if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ
It falls right
You have been talkd of since your travel much
And that in Hamlets hearing for a quality
Wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one and that in my regard
Of the unworthiest siege
What part is that my lord
A very riband in the cap of youth
Yet needful too for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds
Importing health and graveness Two months since
Here was a gentleman of Normandy
Ive seen myself and served against the French
And they can well on horseback but this gallant
Had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
As he had been incorpsed and deminatured
With the brave beast so far he toppd my thought
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
Come short of what he did
A Norman wast
A Norman
Upon my life Lamond
The very same
I know him well he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation
He made confession of you
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially
That he cried out twould be a sight indeed
If one could match you the scrimers of their nation
He swore had had neither motion guard nor eye
If you opposed them Sir this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming oer to play with him
Now out of this
What out of this my lord
Laertes was your father dear to you
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow
A face without a heart
Why ask you this
Not that I think you did not love your father
But that I know love is begun by time
And that I see in passages of proof
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
And nothing is at a like goodness still
For goodness growing to a plurisy
Dies in his own too much that we would do
We should do when we would for this would changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues are hands are accidents
And then this should is like a spendthrift sigh
That hurts by easing But to the quick o the ulcer
Hamlet comes back what would you undertake
To show yourself your fathers son in deed
More than in words
To cut his throat i the church
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize
Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes
Will you do this keep close within your chamber
Hamlet returnd shall know you are come home
Well put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads he being remiss
Most generous and free from all contriving
Will not peruse the foils so that with ease
Or with a little shuffling you may choose
Requite him for your father
I will dot
And for that purpose Ill anoint my sword
I bought an unction of a mountebank
So mortal that but dip a knife in it
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon can save the thing from death
That is but scratchd withal Ill touch my point
With this contagion that if I gall him slightly
It may be death
Lets further think of this
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape if this should fail
And that our drift look through our bad performance
Twere better not assayd therefore this project
Should have a back or second that might hold
If this should blast in proof Soft let me see
Well make a solemn wager on your cunnings I hat
When in your motion you are hot and dry
As make your bouts more violent to that end
And that he calls for drink Ill have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
If he by chance escape your venomd stuck
Our purpose may hold there
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE
How now sweet queen
One woe doth tread upon anothers heel
So fast they follow your sisters drownd Laertes
Drownd O where
There is a willow grows aslant a brook
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name
But our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them
There on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang an envious sliver broke
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide
And mermaidlike awhile they bore her up
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
As one incapable of her own distress
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element but long it could not be
Till that her garments heavy with their drink
Pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death
Alas then she is drownd
Drownd drownd
Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia
And therefore I forbid my tears but yet
It is our trick nature her custom holds
Let shame say what it will when these are gone
The woman will be out Adieu my lord
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
But that this folly douts it
Exit
Lets follow Gertrude
How much I had to do to calm his rage
Now fear I this will give it start again
Therefore lets follow
Exeunt
Enter two Clowns with spades  and c
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salvation
I tell thee she is and therefore make her grave
straight the crowner hath sat on her and finds it
Christian burial
How can that be unless she drowned herself in her
own defence
Why tis found so
It must be se offendendo it cannot be else For
here lies the point  if I drown myself wittingly
herself wittingly
Nay but hear you goodman delver
Give me leave Here lies the water good here
stands the man good if the man go to this water
and drown himself it is will he nill he he
goesmark you that but if the water come to him
and drown him he drowns not himself argal he
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life
But is this law
Ay marry ist crowners quest law
Will you ha the truth ont If this had not been
a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o
Christian burial
Why there thou sayst and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves more than their even
Christian Come my spade There is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners ditchers and gravemakers
they hold up Adams profession
Was he a gentleman
He was the first that ever bore arms
Why he had none
What art a heathen How dost thou understand the
Scripture The Scripture says Adam digged
could he dig without arms Ill put another
question to thee if thou answerest me not to the
purpose confess thyself
Go to
What is he that builds stronger than either the
mason the shipwright or the carpenter
The gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants
I like thy wit well in good faith the gallows
does well but how does it well it does well to
those that do in now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church argal
the gallows may do well to thee Tot again come
Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or
a carpenter
Ay tell me that and unyoke
Marry now I can tell
Tot
Mass I cannot tell
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO at a distance
Cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull
ass will not mend his pace with beating and when
you are asked this question next say a
gravemaker the houses that he makes last till
doomsday Go get thee to Yaughan fetch me a
stoup of liquor
Exit Second Clown
He digs and sings
In youth when I did love did love
Methought it was very sweet
O methought there was nothing meet
Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he
sings at gravemaking
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
Tis een so the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense
Sings
But age with his stealing steps
Hath clawd me in his clutch
And hath shipped me intil the land
As if I had never been such
Throws up a skull
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were
Cains jawbone that did the first murder It
might be the pate of a politician which this ass
now oerreaches one that would circumvent God
might it not
It might my lord
Or of a courtier which could say Good morrow
sweet lord How dost thou good lord This might
be my lord suchaone that praised my lord
suchaones horse when he meant to beg it might it not
Ay my lord
Why een so and now my Lady Worms chapless and
knocked about the mazzard with a sextons spade
heres fine revolution an we had the trick to
seet Did these bones cost no more the breeding
but to play at loggats with em mine ache to think ont
Sings
A pickaxe and a spade a spade
For and a shrouding sheet
O a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet
Throws up another skull
Theres another why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer Where be his quiddities now his quillets
his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of
ins time a great buyer of land with his statutes
his recognizances his fines his double vouchers
his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and
the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases and double ones too than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha
Not a jot more my lord
Is not parchment made of sheepskins
Ay my lord and of calfskins too
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
in that I will speak to this fellow Whose
graves this sirrah
Mine sir
Sings
O a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet
I think it be thine indeed for thou liest int
You lie out ont sir and therefore it is not
yours for my part I do not lie int and yet it is mine
Thou dost lie int to be int and say it is thine
tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest
Tis a quick lie sir twill away gain from me to
you
What man dost thou dig it for
For no man sir
What woman then
For none neither
Who is to be buried int
One that was a woman sir but rest her soul shes dead
How absolute the knave is we must speak by the
card or equivocation will undo us By the Lord
Horatio these three years I have taken a note of
it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
gaffs his kibe How long hast thou been a
gravemaker
Of all the days i the year I came tot that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
How long is that since
Cannot you tell that every fool can tell that it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that
is mad and sent into England
Ay marry why was he sent into England
Why because he was mad he shall recover his wits
there or if he do not its no great matter there
Why
Twill a not be seen in him there there the men
are as mad as he
How came he mad
Very strangely they say
How strangely
Faith een with losing his wits
Upon what ground
Why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man
and boy thirty years
How long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot
I faith if he be not rotten before he dieas we
have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce
hold the laying inhe will last you some eight year
or nine year a tanner will last you nine year
Why he more than another
Why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that
he will keep out water a great while and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
Heres a skull now this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years
Whose was it
A whoreson mad fellows it was whose do you think it was
Nay I know not
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue a poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once This same skull
sir was Yoricks skull the kings jester
This
Een that
Let me see
Takes the skull
Alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow
of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times and now how
abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rims at
it Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft Where be your gibes now your
gambols your songs your flashes of merriment
that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one
now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen
Now get you to my ladys chamber and tell her let
her paint an inch thick to this favour she must
come make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio tell
me one thing
Whats that my lord
Dost thou think Alexander looked o this fashion i
the earth
Een so
And smelt so pah
Puts down the skull
Een so my lord
To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander
till he find it stopping a bunghole
Twere to consider too curiously to consider so
No faith not a jot but to follow him thither with
modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as
thus Alexander died Alexander was buried
Alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of
earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel
Imperious Caesar dead and turnd to clay
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
O that that earth which kept the world in awe
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw
But soft but soft aside here comes the king
Enter Priest  and c in procession the Corpse of  OPHELIA LAERTES and Mourners following KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE their trains  and c
The queen the courtiers who is this they follow
And with such maimed rites This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life twas of some estate
Couch we awhile and mark
Retiring with HORATIO
What ceremony else
That is Laertes
A very noble youth mark
What ceremony else
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise her death was doubtful
And but that great command oersways the order
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
Yet here she is allowd her virgin crants
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial
Must there no more be done
No more be done
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peaceparted souls
Lay her i the earth
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring I tell thee churlish priest
A ministering angel shall my sister be
When thou liest howling
What the fair Ophelia
Sweets to the sweet farewell
Scattering flowers
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlets wife
I thought thy bridebed to have deckd sweet maid
And not have strewd thy grave
O treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of Hold off the earth awhile
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
Leaps into the grave
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
Till of this flat a mountain you have made
To oertop old Pelion or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus
Advancing     What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
Like wonderwounded hearers This is I
Hamlet the Dane
Leaps into the grave
The devil take thy soul
Grappling with him
Thou prayst not well
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat
For though I am not splenitive and rash
Yet have I something in me dangerous
Which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand
Pluck them asunder
Hamlet Hamlet
Gentlemen
Good my lord be quiet
The Attendants part them and they come out of the grave
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag
O my son what theme
I loved Ophelia forty thousand brothers
Could not with all their quantity of love
Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her
O he is mad Laertes
For love of God forbear him
Swounds show me what thoult do
Woot weep woot fight woot fast woot tear thyself
Woot drink up eisel eat a crocodile
Ill dot Dost thou come here to whine
To outface me with leaping in her grave
Be buried quick with her and so will I
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw
Millions of acres on us till our ground
Singeing his pate against the burning zone
Make Ossa like a wart Nay an thoult mouth
Ill rant as well as thou
This is mere madness
And thus awhile the fit will work on him
Anon as patient as the female dove
When that her golden couplets are disclosed
His silence will sit drooping
Hear you sir
What is the reason that you use me thus
I loved you ever but it is no matter
Let Hercules himself do what he may
The cat will mew and dog will have his day
Exit
I pray you good Horatio wait upon him
Exit HORATIO
To LAERTES
Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech
Well put the matter to the present push
Good Gertrude set some watch over your son
This grave shall have a living monument
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see
Till then in patience our proceeding be
Exeunt
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO
So much for this sir now shall you see the other
You do remember all the circumstance
Remember it my lord
Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes Rashly
And praised be rashness for it let us know
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
When our deep plots do pall and that should teach us
Theres a divinity that shapes our ends
Roughhew them how we will
That is most certain
Up from my cabin
My seagown scarfd about me in the dark
Groped I to find out them had my desire
Fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again making so bold
My fears forgetting manners to unseal
Their grand commission where I found Horatio
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmarks health and Englands too
With ho such bugs and goblins in my life
That on the supervise no leisure bated
No not to stay the grinding of the axe
My head should be struck off
Ist possible
Heres the commission read it at more leisure
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed
I beseech you
Being thus benetted round with villanies
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains
They had begun the playI sat me down
Devised a new commission wrote it fair
I once did hold it as our statists do
A baseness to write fair and labourd much
How to forget that learning but sir now
It did me yeomans service wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote
Ay good my lord
An earnest conjuration from the king
As England was his faithful tributary
As love between them like the palm might flourish
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma tween their amities
And many suchlike Ases of great charge
That on the view and knowing of these contents
Without debatement further more or less
He should the bearers put to sudden death
Not shrivingtime allowd
How was this seald
Why even in that was heaven ordinant
I had my fathers signet in my purse
Which was the model of that Danish seal
Folded the writ up in form of the other
Subscribed it gavet the impression placed it safely
The changeling never known Now the next day
Was our seafight and what to this was sequent
Thou knowst already
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go tot
Why man they did make love to this employment
They are not near my conscience their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites
Why what a king is this
Does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon
He that hath killd my king and whored my mother
Poppd in between the election and my hopes
Thrown out his angle for my proper life
And with such cozenageist not perfect conscience
To quit him with this arm and ist not to be damnd
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there
It will be short the interim is mine
And a mans lifes no more than to say One
But I am very sorry good Horatio
That to Laertes I forgot myself
For by the image of my cause I see
The portraiture of his Ill court his favours
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion
Peace who comes here
Enter OSRIC
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
I humbly thank you sir Dost know this waterfly
No my good lord
Thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to
know him He hath much land and fertile let a
beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at
the kings mess tis a chough but as I say
spacious in the possession of dirt
Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I
should impart a thing to you from his majesty
I will receive it sir with all diligence of
spirit Put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head
I thank your lordship it is very hot
No believe me tis very cold the wind is
northerly
It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion
Exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas
twereI cannot tell how But my lord his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head sir this is the matter
I beseech you remember
HAMLET moves him to put on his hat
Nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe
me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent
differences of very soft society and great showing
indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or
calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see
Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you
though I know to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw
neither in respect of his quick sail But in the
verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of
great article and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness as to make true diction of him his
semblable is his mirror and who else would trace
him his umbrage nothing more
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
The concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath
Sir
Ist not possible to understand in another tongue
You will dot sir really
What imports the nomination of this gentleman
Of Laertes
His purse is empty already alls golden words are spent
Of him sir
I know you are not ignorant
I would you did sir yet in faith if you did
it would not much approve me Well sir
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with
him in excellence but to know a man well were to
know himself
I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation
laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowed
Whats his weapon
Rapier and dagger
Thats two of his weapons but well
The king sir hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses against the which he has imponed as I take
it six French rapiers and poniards with their
assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the
carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very
responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages
and of very liberal conceit
What call you the carriages
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done
The carriages sir are the hangers
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we
could carry cannon by our sides I would it might
be hangers till then But on six Barbary horses
against six French swords their assigns and three
liberalconceited carriages thats the French bet
against the Danish Why is this imponed as you call it
The king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him he shall not exceed you
three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it
would come to immediate trial if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer
How if I answer no
I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
Sir I will walk here in the hall if it please his
majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let
the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the
king hold his purpose I will win for him an I can
if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
Shall I redeliver you een so
To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
I commend my duty to your lordship
Yours yours
Exit OSRIC
He does well to commend it himself there are no
tongues else fors turn
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
He did comply with his dug before he sucked it
Thus has heand many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of
yesty collection which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do
but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
Enter a Lord
My lord his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes or that you will take longer time
I am constant to my purpose they follow the kings
pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now
or whensoever provided I be so able as now
The king and queen and all are coming down
In happy time
The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play
She well instructs me
Exit Lord
You will lose this wager my lord
I do not think so since he went into France I
odds But thou wouldst not think how ill alls here
about my heart but it is no matter
Nay good my lord
It is but foolery but it is such a kind of
gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman
If your mind dislike any thing obey it I will
forestall their repair hither and say you are not
fit
Not a whit we defy augury theres a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be now
tis not to come if it be not to come it will be
now if it be not now yet it will come the
readiness is all since no man has aught of what he
leaves what ist to leave betimes
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE LAERTES Lords OSRIC and Attendants with foils  and c
Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES hand into HAMLETs
Give me your pardon sir Ive done you wrong
But pardont as you are a gentleman
This presence knows
And you must needs have heard how I am punishd
That might your nature honour and exception
Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness
Wast Hamlet wrongd Laertes Never Hamlet
If Hamlet from himself be taen away
And when hes not himself does wrong Laertes
Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it
Who does it then His madness ift be so
His madness is poor Hamlets enemy
Sir in this audience
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
That I have shot mine arrow oer the house
And hurt my brother
I am satisfied in nature
Whose motive in this case should stir me most
To my revenge but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof and will no reconcilement
Till by some elder masters of known honour
I have a voice and precedent of peace
To keep my name ungored But till that time
I do receive your offerd love like love
And will not wrong it
I embrace it freely
And will this brothers wager frankly play
Give us the foils Come on
Come one for me
Ill be your foil Laertes in mine ignorance
Your skill shall like a star i the darkest night
Stick fiery off indeed
You mock me sir
No by this hand
Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet
You know the wager
Very well my lord
Your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side
I do not fear it I have seen you both
But since he is betterd we have therefore odds
This is too heavy let me see another
This likes me well These foils have all a length
They prepare to play
Ay my good lord
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table
If Hamlet give the first or second hit
Or quit in answer of the third exchange
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
The king shall drink to Hamlets better breath
And in the cup an union shall he throw
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmarks crown have worn Give me the cups
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak
The trumpet to the cannoneer without
The cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth
Now the king dunks to Hamlet Come begin
And you the judges bear a wary eye
Come on sir
Come my lord
They play
One
No
Judgment
A hit a very palpable hit
Well again
Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine
Heres to thy health
Trumpets sound and cannon shot off within
Give him the cup
Ill play this bout first set it by awhile Come
They play
Another hit what say you
A touch a touch I do confess
Our son shall win
Hes fat and scant of breath
Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
The queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet
Good madam
Gertrude do not drink
I will my lord I pray you pardon me
Aside  It is the poisond cup it is too late
I dare not drink yet madam by and by
Come let me wipe thy face
My lord Ill hit him now
I do not thinkt
Aside  And yet tis almost gainst my conscience
Come for the third Laertes you but dally
I pray you pass with your best violence
I am afeard you make a wanton of me
Say you so come on
They play
Nothing neither way
Have at you now
LAERTES wounds HAMLET then in scuffling they change rapiers and HAMLET wounds LAERTES
Part them they are incensed
Nay come again
QUEEN GERTRUDE falls
Look to the queen there ho
They bleed on both sides How is it my lord
How ist Laertes
Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric
I am justly killd with mine own treachery
How does the queen
She swounds to see them bleed
No no the drink the drinkO my dear Hamlet
The drink the drink I am poisond
Dies
O villany Ho let the door be lockd
Treachery Seek it out
It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain
No medicine in the world can do thee good
In thee there is not half an hour of life
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
Hath turnd itself on me lo here I lie
Never to rise again thy mothers poisond
I can no more the king the kings to blame
The pointenvenomd too
Then venom to thy work
Stabs KING CLAUDIUS
Treason treason
O yet defend me friends I am but hurt
Here thou incestuous murderous damned Dane
Drink off this potion Is thy union here
Follow my mother
KING CLAUDIUS dies
He is justly served
It is a poison temperd by himself
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
Mine and my fathers death come not upon thee
Nor thine on me
Dies
Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee
I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu
You that look pale and tremble at this chance
Had I but timeas this fell sergeant death
Is strict in his arrestO I could tell you
But let it be Horatio I am dead
Thou livest report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied
Never believe it
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
Heres yet some liquor left
As thourt a man
Give me the cup let go by heaven Ill havet
O good Horatio what a wounded name
Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
To tell my story
March afar off and shot within
What warlike noise is this
Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley
O I die Horatio
The potent poison quite oercrows my spirit
I cannot live to hear the news from England
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras he has my dying voice
So tell him with the occurrents more and less
Which have solicited The rest is silence
Dies
Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
Why does the drum come hither
March within
Enter FORTINBRAS the English Ambassadors and others
Where is this sight
What is it ye would see
If aught of woe or wonder cease your search
This quarry cries on havoc O proud death
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck
The sight is dismal
And our affairs from England come too late
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
To tell him his commandment is fulfilld
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Where should we have our thanks
Not from his mouth
Had it the ability of life to thank you
He never gave commandment for their death
But since so jump upon this bloody question
You from the Polack wars and you from England
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about so shall you hear
Of accidental judgments casual slaughters
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
And in this upshot purposes mistook
Falln on the inventors reads all this can I
Truly deliver
Let us haste to hear it
And call the noblest to the audience
For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
Of that I shall have also cause to speak
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
But let this same be presently performd
Even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance
On plots and errors happen
Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
For he was likely had he been put on
To have proved most royally and for his passage
The soldiers music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him
Take up the bodies such a sight as this
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss
Go bid the soldiers shoot
A dead march Exeunt bearing off the dead bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
O for a Muse of fire that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention
Then should the warlike Harry like himself
Assume the port of Mars and at his heels
Leashd in like hounds should famine sword and fire
Crouch for employment But pardon and gentles all
The flat unraised spirits that have dared
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
So great an object can this cockpit hold
The vasty fields of France or may we cram
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt
O pardon since a crooked figure may
Attest in little place a million
And let us ciphers to this great accompt
On your imaginary forces work
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Are now confined two mighty monarchies
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts
Into a thousand parts divide on man
And make imaginary puissance
Think when we talk of horses that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i the receiving earth
For tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings
Carry them here and there jumping oer times
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Into an hourglass for the which supply
Admit me Chorus to this history
Who prologuelike your humble patience pray
Gently to hear kindly to judge our play
Exit
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP OF ELY
My lord Ill tell you that self bill is urged
Which in the eleventh year of the last kings reign
Was like and had indeed against us passd
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question
But how my lord shall we resist it now
It must be thought on If it pass against us
We lose the better half of our possession
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Would they strip from us being valued thus
As much as would maintain to the kings honour
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires
And to relief of lazars and weak age
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
A hundred almshouses right well supplied
And to the coffers of the king beside
A thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill
This would drink deep
Twould drink the cup and all
But what prevention
The king is full of grace and fair regard
And a true lover of the holy church
The courses of his youth promised it not
The breath no sooner left his fathers body
But that his wildness mortified in him
Seemd to die too yea at that very moment
Consideration like an angel came
And whippd the offending Adam out of him
Leaving his body as a paradise
To envelop and contain celestial spirits
Never was such a sudden scholar made
Never came reformation in a flood
With such a heady currance scouring faults
Nor never Hydraheaded wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king
We are blessed in the change
Hear him but reason in divinity
And alladmiring with an inward wish
You would desire the king were made a prelate
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
You would say it hath been all in all his study
List his discourse of war and you shall hear
A fearful battle renderd you in music
Turn him to any cause of policy
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
Familiar as his garter that when he speaks
The air a charterd libertine is still
And the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears
To steal his sweet and honeyd sentences
Must be the mistress to this theoric
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it
Since his addiction was to courses vain
His companies unletterd rude and shallow
His hours filld up with riots banquets sports
And never noted in him any study
Any retirement any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighbourd by fruit of baser quality
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness which no doubt
Grew like the summer grass fastest by night
Unseen yet crescive in his faculty
It must be so for miracles are ceased
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected
But my good lord
How now for mitigation of this bill
Urged by the commons Doth his majesty
Incline to it or no
He seems indifferent
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us
For I have made an offer to his majesty
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand
Which I have opend to his grace at large
As touching France to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal
How did this offer seem received my lord
With good acceptance of his majesty
Save that there was not time enough to hear
As I perceived his grace would fain have done
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward his greatgrandfather
What was the impediment that broke this off
The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience and the hour I think is come
To give him hearing is it four oclock
It is
Then go we in to know his embassy
Which I could with a ready guess declare
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it
Ill wait upon you and I long to hear it
Exeunt
Enter KING HENRY V GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER WARWICK WESTMORELAND and Attendants
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury
Not here in presence
Send for him good uncle
Shall we call in the ambassador my liege
Not yet my cousin we would be resolved
Before we hear him of some things of weight
That task our thoughts concerning us and France
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP of ELY
God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it
Sure we thank you
My learned lord we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should or should not bar us in our claim
And God forbid my dear and faithful lord
That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate whose right
Suits not in native colours with the truth
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person
How you awake our sleeping sword of war
We charge you in the name of God take heed
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe a sore complaint
Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
That make such waste in brief mortality
Under this conjuration speak my lord
For we will hear note and believe in heart
That what you speak is in your conscience washd
As pure as sin with baptism
Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
That owe yourselves your lives and services
To this imperial throne There is no bar
To make against your highness claim to France
But this which they produce from Pharamond
In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant
No woman shall succeed in Salique land
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe
Where Charles the Great having subdued the Saxons
There left behind and settled certain French
Who holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life
Establishd then this law to wit no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land
Which Salique as I said twixt Elbe and Sala
Is at this day in Germany calld Meisen
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond
Idly supposed the founder of this law
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twentysix and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala in the year
Eight hundred five Besides their writers say
King Pepin which deposed Childeric
Did as heir general being descended
Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair
Make claim and title to the crown of France
Hugh Capet also who usurped the crown
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great
To find his title with some shows of truth
Through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
Conveyd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare
Daughter to Charlemain who was the son
To Lewis the emperor and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet
Could not keep quiet in his conscience
Wearing the crown of France till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was reunited to the crown of France
So that as clear as is the summers sun
King Pepins title and Hugh Capets claim
To hold in right and title of the female
So do the kings of France unto this day
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurpd from you and your progenitors
May I with right and conscience make this claim
The sin upon my head dread sovereign
For in the book of Numbers is it writ
When the man dies let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord
Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
Look back into your mighty ancestors
Go my dread lord to your greatgrandsires tomb
From whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
And your greatuncles Edward the Black Prince
Who on the French ground playd a tragedy
Making defeat on the full power of France
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lions whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility
O noble English that could entertain
With half their forces the full Pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats
You are their heir you sit upon their throne
The blood and courage that renowned them
Runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege
Is in the very Maymorn of his youth
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
As did the former lions of your blood
They know your grace hath cause and means and might
So hath your highness never king of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie paviliond in the fields of France
O let their bodies follow my dear liege
With blood and sword and fire to win your right
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors
We must not only arm to invade the French
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot who will make road upon us
With all advantages
They of those marches gracious sovereign
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only
But fear the main intendment of the Scot
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
For you shall read that my greatgrandfather
Never went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his unfurnishd kingdom
Came pouring like the tide into a breach
With ample and brim fulness of his force
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns
That England being empty of defence
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood
She hath been then more feard than harmd my liege
For hear her but exampled by herself
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots whom she did send to France
To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner kings
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries
But theres a saying very old and true
If that you will France win
Then with Scotland first begin
For once the eagle England being in prey
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat
To tear and havoc more than she can eat
It follows then the cat must stay at home
Yet that is but a crushd necessity
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad
The advised head defends itself at home
For government though high and low and lower
Put into parts doth keep in one consent
Congreeing in a full and natural close
Like music
Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions
Setting endeavour in continual motion
To which is fixed as an aim or butt
Obedience for so work the honeybees
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
They have a king and officers of sorts
Where some like magistrates correct at home
Others like merchants venture trade abroad
Others like soldiers armed in their stings
Make boot upon the summers velvet buds
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tentroyal of their emperor
Who busied in his majesty surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold
The civil citizens kneading up the honey
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
The sadeyed justice with his surly hum
Delivering oer to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone I this infer
That many things having full reference
To one consent may work contrariously
As many arrows loosed several ways
Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
As many lines close in the dials centre
End in one purpose and be all well borne
Without defeat Therefore to France my liege
Divide your happy England into four
Whereof take you one quarter into France
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake
If we with thrice such powers left at home
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
Exeunt some Attendants
Now are we well resolved and by Gods help
And yours the noble sinews of our power
France being ours well bend it to our awe
Or break it all to pieces or there well sit
Ruling in large and ample empery
Oer France and all her almost kingly dukedoms
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
Tombless with no remembrance over them
Either our history shall with full mouth
Like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
Not worshippd with a waxen epitaph
Enter Ambassadors of France
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
Of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear
Your greeting is from him not from the king
Mayt please your majesty to give us leave
Freely to render what we have in charge
Or shall we sparingly show you far off
The Dauphins meaning and our embassy
We are no tyrant but a Christian king
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
As are our wretches fetterd in our prisons
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Tell us the Dauphins mind
Thus then in few
Your highness lately sending into France
Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third
In answer of which claim the prince our master
Says that you savour too much of your youth
And bids you be advised theres nought in France
That can be with a nimble galliard won
You cannot revel into dukedoms there
He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
This tun of treasure and in lieu of this
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks
What treasure uncle
Tennisballs my liege
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us
His present and your pains we thank you for
When we have marchd our rackets to these balls
We will in France by Gods grace play a set
Shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturbd
With chaces And we understand him well
How he comes oer us with our wilder days
Not measuring what use we made of them
We never valued this poor seat of England
And therefore living hence did give ourself
To barbarous licence as tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
When I do rouse me in my throne of France
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for workingdays
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France
Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Hath turnd his balls to gunstones and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphins scorn
But this lies all within the will of God
To whom I do appeal and in whose name
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightful hand in a wellhallowd cause
So get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it
Convey them with safe conduct Fare you well
Exeunt Ambassadors
This was a merry message
We hope to make the sender blush at it
Therefore my lords omit no happy hour
That may give furtherance to our expedition
For we have now no thought in us but France
Save those to God that run before our business
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness add
More feathers to our wings for God before
Well chide this Dauphin at his fathers door
Therefore let every man now task his thought
Exeunt Flourish
PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
Now all the youth of England are on fire
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
Now thrive the armourers and honours thought
Reigns solely in the breast of every man
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse
Following the mirror of all Christian kings
With winged heels as English Mercuries
For now sits Expectation in the air
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
With crowns imperial crowns and coronets
Promised to Harry and his followers
The French advised by good intelligence
Of this most dreadful preparation
Shake in their fear and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes
O England model to thy inward greatness
Like little body with a mighty heart
What mightst thou do that honour would thee do
Were all thy children kind and natural
But see thy fault France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
With treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third
Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland
Have for the gilt of FranceO guilt indeed
Confirmd conspiracy with fearful France
And by their hands this grace of kings must die
If hell and treason hold their promises
Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton
Linger your patience on and well digest
The abuse of distance force a play
The sum is paid the traitors are agreed
Is now transported gentles to Southampton
There is the playhouse now there must you sit
And thence to France shall we convey you safe
And bring you back charming the narrow seas
To give you gentle pass for if we may
Well not offend one stomach with our play
But till the king come forth and not till then

Well then thats the humour oft
Reenter Hostess
As ever you came of women come in quickly to Sir
John Ah poor heart he is so shaked of a burning
quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to
behold Sweet men come to him
The king hath run bad humours on the knight thats
the even of it
Nym thou hast spoke the right
The king is a good king but it must be as it may
he passes some humours and careers
Let us condole the knight for lambkins we will live
Enter EXETER BEDFORD and WESTMORELAND
Fore God his grace is bold to trust these traitors
They shall be apprehended by and by
How smooth and even they do bear themselves
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty
The king hath note of all that they intend
By interception which they dream not of
Nay but the man that was his bedfellow
Whom he hath dulld and cloyd with gracious favours
That he should for a foreign purse so sell
His sovereigns life to death and treachery
Trumpets sound Enter KING HENRY V SCROOP CAMBRIDGE GREY and Attendants
Now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham
And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France
For which we have in head assembled them
No doubt my liege if each man do his best
I doubt not that since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Success and conquest to attend on us
Never was monarch better feard and loved
Than is your majesty theres not I think a subject
That sits in heartgrief and uneasiness
Under the sweet shade of your government
True those that were your fathers enemies
Have steepd their galls in honey and do serve you
With hearts create of duty and of zeal
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness
And shall forget the office of our hand
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
According to the weight and worthiness
So service shall with steeled sinews toil
And labour shall refresh itself with hope
To do your grace incessant services
We judge no less Uncle of Exeter
Enlarge the man committed yesterday
That raild against our person we consider
it was excess of wine that set him on
And on his more advice we pardon him
Thats mercy but too much security
Let him be punishd sovereign lest example
Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
O let us yet be merciful
So may your highness and yet punish too
Sir
You show great mercy if you give him life
After the taste of much correction
Alas your too much love and care of me
Are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
If little faults proceeding on distemper
Shall not be winkd at how shall we stretch our eye
When capital crimes chewd swallowd and digested
Appear before us Well yet enlarge that man
Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care
And tender preservation of our person
Would have him punished And now to our French causes
Who are the late commissioners
I one my lord
Your highness bade me ask for it today
So did you me my liege
And I my royal sovereign
Then Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours
There yours Lord Scroop of Masham and sir knight
Grey of Northumberland this same is yours
Read them and know I know your worthiness
My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter
We will aboard to night Why how now gentlemen
What see you in those papers that you lose
So much complexion Look ye how they change
Their cheeks are paper Why what read you there
That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
Out of appearance
I do confess my fault
And do submit me to your highness mercy
To which we all appeal
The mercy that was quick in us but late
By your own counsel is suppressd and killd
You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
As dogs upon their masters worrying you
See you my princes and my noble peers
These English monsters My Lord of Cambridge here
You know how apt our love was to accord
To furnish him with all appertinents
Belonging to his honour and this man
Hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired
To kill us here in Hampton to the which
This knight no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O
What shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel
Ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
That knewst the very bottom of my soul
That almost mightst have coind me into gold
May it be possible that foreign hire
That might annoy my finger tis so strange
That though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white my eye will scarcely see it
Treason and murder ever kept together
As two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose
Working so grossly in a natural cause
That admiration did not whoop at them
But thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence
All other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches colours and with forms being fetchd
From glistering semblances of piety
But he that temperd thee bade thee stand up
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
If that same demon that hath gulld thee thus
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world
He might return to vasty Tartar back
And tell the legions I can never win
A soul so easy as that Englishmans
O how hast thou with jealousy infected
The sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful
Why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
Why so didst thou come they of noble family
Why so didst thou seem they religious
Why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
Constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
Garnishd and deckd in modest complement
Not working with the eye without the ear
And but in purged judgment trusting neither
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
To mark the fullfraught man and best indued
With some suspicion I will weep for thee
For this revolt of thine methinks is like
Another fall of man Their faults are open
Arrest them to the answer of the law
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of
Richard Earl of Cambridge
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of
Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland
Our purposes God justly hath discoverd
And I repent my fault more than my death
Which I beseech your highness to forgive
Although my body pay the price of it
For me the gold of France did not seduce
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended
But God be thanked for prevention
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice
Beseeching God and you to pardon me
Never did faithful subject more rejoice
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Than I do at this hour joy oer myself
Prevented from a damned enterprise
My fault but not my body pardon sovereign
God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence
You have conspired against our royal person
Joind with an enemy proclaimd and from his coffers
Received the golden earnest of our death
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
His princes and his peers to servitude
His subjects to oppression and contempt
And his whole kingdom into desolation
Touching our person seek we no revenge
But we our kingdoms safety must so tender
Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
We do deliver you Get you therefore hence
Poor miserable wretches to your death
The taste whereof God of his mercy give
You patience to endure and true repentance
Of all your dear offences Bear them hence
Exeunt CAMBRIDGE SCROOP and GREY guarded
Now lords for France the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you as us like glorious
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings We doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way
Then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
Our puissance into the hand of God
Putting it straight in expedition
Cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
No king of England if not king of France
Exeunt
Enter PISTOL Hostess NYM BARDOLPH and Boy
Prithee honeysweet husband let me bring thee to Staines
No for my manly heart doth yearn
Bardolph be blithe Nym rouse thy vaunting veins
Boy bristle thy courage up for Falstaff he is dead
And we must yearn therefore
Would I were with him wheresomeer he is either in
heaven or in hell
Nay sure hes not in hell hes in Arthurs
bosom if ever man went to Arthurs bosom A made
a finer end and went away an it had been any
christom child a parted even just between twelve
and one even at the turning o the tide for after
I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
flowers and smile upon his fingers ends I knew
there was but one way for his nose was as sharp as
a pen and a babbled of green fields How now
sir John quoth Iwhat man be o good
cheer So a cried out God God God three or
four times Now I to comfort him bid him a
should not think of God I hoped there was no need
to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet So
a bade me lay more clothes on his feet I put my
hand into the bed and felt them and they were as
cold as any stone then I felt to his knees and
they were as cold as any stone and so upward and
upward and all was as cold as any stone
They say he cried out of sack
Ay that a did
And of women
Nay that a did not
Yes that a did and said they were devils
incarnate
A could never abide carnation twas a colour he
never liked
A said once the devil would have him about women
A did in some sort indeed handle women but then
he was rheumatic and talked of the whore of Babylon
Do you not remember a saw a flea stick upon
Bardolphs nose and a said it was a black soul
burning in hellfire
Well the fuel is gone that maintained that fire
thats all the riches I got in his service
Shall we shog the king will be gone from
Southampton
Come lets away My love give me thy lips
Look to my chattels and my movables
Let senses rule the word is Pitch and Pay
Trust none
For oaths are straws mens faiths are wafercakes
And holdfast is the only dog my duck
Therefore Caveto be thy counsellor
Go clear thy c rystals Yokefellows in arms
Let us to France like horseleeches my boys
To suck to suck the very blood to suck
And thats but unwholesome food they say
Touch her soft mouth and march
Farewell hostess
Kissing her
I cannot kiss that is the humour of it but adieu
Let housewifery appear keep close I thee command
Farewell adieu
Exeunt
Flourish Enter the FRENCH KING the DAUPHIN the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE the Constable and others
Thus comes the English with full power upon us
And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne
Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth
And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch
To line and new repair our towns of war
With men of courage and with means defendant
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf
It fits us then to be as provident
As fear may teach us out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields
My most redoubted father
It is most meet we arm us gainst the foe
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question
But that defences musters preparations
Should be maintaind assembled and collected
As were a war in expectation
Therefore I say tis meet we all go forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France
And let us do it with no show of fear
No with no more than if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance
For my good liege she is so idly kingd
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
That fear attends her not
O peace Prince Dauphin
You are too much mistaken in this king
Question your grace the late ambassadors
With what great state he heard their embassy
How well supplied with noble counsellors
How modest in exception and withal
How terrible in constant resolution
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus
Covering discretion with a coat of folly
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate
Well tis not so my lord high constable
But though we think it so it is no matter
In cases of defence tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems
So the proportions of defence are filld
Which of a weak or niggardly projection
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth
Think we King Harry strong
And princes look you strongly arm to meet him
The kindred of him hath been fleshd upon us
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
That haunted us in our familiar paths
Witness our too much memorable shame
When Cressy battle fatally was struck
And all our princes captivd by the hand
Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales
Whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
Up in the air crownd with the golden sun
Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him
Mangle the work of nature and deface
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
Had twenty years been made This is a stem
Of that victorious stock and let us fear
The native mightiness and fate of him
Enter a Messenger
Ambassadors from Harry King of England
Do crave admittance to your majesty
Well give them present audience Go and bring them
Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords
You see this chase is hotly followd friends
Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them Good my sovereign
Take up the English short and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head
Selflove my liege is not so vile a sin
As selfneglecting
Reenter Lords with EXETER and train
From our brother England
From him and thus he greets your majesty
He wills you in the name of God Almighty
That you divest yourself and lay apart
The borrowd glories that by gift of heaven
By law of nature and of nations long
To him and to his heirs namely the crown
And all widestretched honours that pertain
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France That you may know
Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
Pickd from the wormholes of longvanishd days
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked
He sends you this most memorable line
In every branch truly demonstrative
Willing to overlook this pedigree
And when you find him evenly derived
From his most famed of famous ancestors
Edward the Third he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom indirectly held
From him the native and true challenger
Or else what follows
Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts there will he rake for it
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove
That if requiring fail he will compel
And bids you in the bowels of the Lord
Deliver up the crown and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws and on your head
Turning the widows tears the orphans cries
The dead mens blood the pining maidens groans
For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
That shall be swallowd in this controversy
This is his claim his threatening and my message
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here
To whom expressly I bring greeting too
For us we will consider of this further
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
Back to our brother England
For the Dauphin
I stand here for him what to him from England
Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
And any thing that may not misbecome
The mighty sender doth he prize you at
Thus says my king an if your fathers highness
Do not in grant of all demands at large
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty
Hell call you to so hot an answer of it
That caves and womby vaultages of France
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordnance
Say if my father render fair return
It is against my will for I desire
Nothing but odds with England to that end
As matching to his youth and vanity
I did present him with the Paris balls
Hell make your Paris Louvre shake for it
Were it the mistresscourt of mighty Europe
And be assured youll find a difference
As we his subjects have in wonder found
Between the promise of his greener days
And these he masters now now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain that you shall read
In your own losses if he stay in France
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
Come here himself to question our delay
For he is footed in this land already
You shall be soon dispatchs with fair conditions
A night is but small breath and little pause
To answer matters of this consequence
Flourish Exeunt
PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought Suppose that you have seen
The wellappointed king at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning
Play with your fancies and in them behold
Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
To sounds confused behold the threaden sails
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowd sea
Breasting the lofty surge O do but think
You stand upon the ravage and behold
A city on the inconstant billows dancing
For so appears this fleet majestical
Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
And leave your England as dead midnight still
Guarded with grandsires babies and old women
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance
For who is he whose chin is but enrichd
With one appearing hair that will not follow
These culld and choicedrawn cavaliers to France
Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
Behold the ordnance on their carriages
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Katharine his daughter and with her to dowry
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
The offer likes not and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches
Alarum and chambers go off
And down goes all before them Still be kind
And eke out our performance with your mind
Exit
Alarum Enter KING HENRY EXETER BEDFORD GLOUCESTER and Soldiers with scalingladders
Once more unto the breach dear friends once more
Or close the wall up with our English dead
In peace theres nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility
But when the blast of war blows in our ears
Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
Disguise fair nature with hardfavourd rage
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect
Let pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon let the brow oerwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
Oerhang and jutty his confounded base
Swilld with the wild and wasteful ocean
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height On on you noblest English
Whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof
Fathers that like so many Alexanders
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument
Dishonour not your mothers now attest
That those whom you calld fathers did beget you
Be copy now to men of grosser blood
And teach them how to war And you good yeoman
Whose limbs were made in England show us here
The mettle of your pasture let us swear
That you are worth your breeding which I doubt not
For there is none of you so mean and base
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
Straining upon the start The games afoot
Follow your spirit and upon this charge
Cry God for Harry England and Saint George
Exeunt Alarum and chambers go off
Enter NYM BARDOLPH PISTOL and Boy
On on on on on to the breach to the breach
Pray thee corporal stay the knocks are too hot
and for mine own part I have not a case of lives
the humour of it is too hot that is the very
plainsong of it
The plainsong is most just for humours do abound
Knocks go and come Gods vassals drop and die
And sword and shield
In bloody field
Doth win immortal fame
Would I were in an alehouse in London I would give
all my fame for a pot of ale and safety
And I
If wishes would prevail with me
My purpose should not fail with me
But thither would I hie
As duly but not as truly
As bird doth sing on bough
Enter FLUELLEN
Up to the breach you dogs avaunt you cullions
Driving them forward
Be merciful great duke to men of mould
Abate thy rage abate thy manly rage
Abate thy rage great duke
Good bawcock bate thy rage use lenity sweet chuck
These be good humours your honour wins bad humours
Exeunt all but Boy
As young as I am I have observed these three
swashers I am boy to them all three but all they
three though they would serve me could not be man
to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man For Bardolph he is whitelivered and
redfaced by the means whereof a faces it out but
fights not For Pistol he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks
words and keeps whole weapons For Nym he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a
should be thought a coward but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds for a never
broke any mans head but his own and that was
against a post when he was drunk They will steal
any thing and call it purchase Bardolph stole a
lutecase bore it twelve leagues and sold it for
three half pence Nym and Bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a
fireshovel I knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals They would have me as
familiar with mens pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers which makes much against my manhood
if I should take from anothers pocket to put into
mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I
must leave them and seek some better service
their villany goes against my weak stomach and
therefore I must cast it up
Exit
Reenter FLUELLEN GOWER following
Captain Fluellen you must come presently to the
mines the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you
To the mines tell you the duke it is not so good

The Duke of Gloucester to whom the order of the
siege is given is altogether directed by an
Irishman a very valiant gentleman i faith
It is Captain Macmorris is it not

By Cheshu he is an ass as in the world I will
verify as much in his beard be has no more

Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY
Here a comes and the Scots captain Captain Jamy with him
Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman
that is certain and of great expedition and
knowledge in th aunchient wars upon my particular
knowledge of his directions by Cheshu he will
maintain his argument as well as any military man in
the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars
of the Romans

the military discipline that is the point
It sall be vary gud gud feith gud captains bath

other particularities
I do not know you so good a man as myself so

bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war
and there is an end
Exeunt
The Governor and some Citizens on the walls the English forces below Enter KING HENRY and his train
How yet resolves the governor of the town
This is the latest parle we will admit
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
Or like to men proud of destruction
Defy us to our worst for as I am a soldier
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best
If I begin the battery once again
I will not leave the halfachieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie buried
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up
And the fleshd soldier rough and hard of heart
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
Your freshfair virgins and your flowering infants
What is it then to me if impious war
Arrayd in flames like to the prince of fiends
Do with his smirchd complexion all fell feats
Enlinkd to waste and desolation
What ist to me when you yourselves are cause
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the leviathan
To come ashore Therefore you men of Harfleur
Take pity of your town and of your people
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
Oerblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder spoil and villany
If not why in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters
Your fathers taken by the silver beards
And their most reverend heads dashd to the walls
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry
At Herods bloodyhunting slaughtermen
What say you will you yield and this avoid
Or guilty in defence be thus destroyd
Our expectation hath this day an end
The Dauphin whom of succors we entreated
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
To raise so great a siege Therefore great king
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
Enter our gates dispose of us and ours
For we no longer are defensible
Open your gates Come uncle Exeter
Go you and enter Harfleur there remain
And fortify it strongly gainst the French
Use mercy to them all For us dear uncle
The winter coming on and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers we will retire to Calais
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest
Tomorrow for the march are we addrest

Exeunt
Enter the KING OF FRANCE the DAUPHIN the DUKE oF BOURBON the Constable Of France and others
Tis certain he hath passd the river Somme
And if he be not fought withal my lord
Let us not live in France let us quit all
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people
O Dieu vivant shall a few sprays of us
The emptying of our fathers luxury
Our scions put in wild and savage stock
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
And overlook their grafters
Normans but bastard Normans Norman bastards
Mort de ma vie if they march along
Unfought withal but I will sell my dukedom
To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
In that nookshotten isle of Albion
Dieu de batailles where have they this mettle
Is not their climate foggy raw and dull
On whom as in despite the sun looks pale
Killing their fruit with frowns Can sodden water
A drench for surreind jades their barleybroth
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
And shall our quick blood spirited with wine
Seem frosty O for honour of our land
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Upon our houses thatch whiles a more frosty people
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields
Poor we may call them in their native lords
By faith and honour
Our madams mock at us and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
To newstore France with bastard warriors
They bid us to the English dancingschools
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos
Saying our grace is only in our heels
And that we are most lofty runaways
Where is Montjoy the herald speed him hence
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance
Up princes and with spirit of honour edged
More sharper than your swords hie to the field
Charles Delabreth high constable of France
You Dukes of Orleans Bourbon and of Berri
Alencon Brabant Bar and Burgundy
Jaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont
Beaumont Grandpre Roussi and Fauconberg
Foix Lestrale Bouciqualt and Charolois
High dukes great princes barons lords and knights
For your great seats now quit you of great shames
Bar Harry England that sweeps through our land
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur
Rush on his host as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys whose low vassal seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
Go down upon him you have power enough
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner
This becomes the great
Sorry am I his numbers are so few
His soldiers sick and famishd in their march
For I am sure when he shall see our army
Hell drop his heart into the sink of fear
And for achievement offer us his ransom
Therefore lord constable haste on Montjoy
And let him say to England that we send
To know what willing ransom he will give
Prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Rouen
Not so I do beseech your majesty
Be patient for you shall remain with us
Now forth lord constable and princes all
And quickly bring us word of Englands fall
Exeunt
Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN meeting
How now Captain Fluellen come you from the bridge
I assure you there is very excellent services
committed at the bridge
Is the Duke of Exeter safe
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon
and a man that I love and honour with my soul and my
heart and my duty and my life and my living and
my uttermost power he is notGod be praised and
blessedany hurt in the world but keeps the
bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
pridge I think in my very conscience he is as
valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is a man of no
estimation in the world but did see him do as
gallant service
What do you call him
He is called Aunchient Pistol
I know him not
Enter PISTOL
Here is the man
Captain I thee beseech to do me favours
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well
Ay I praise God and I have merited some love at
his hands
Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
And giddy Fortunes furious fickle wheel
That goddess blind
That stands upon the rolling restless stone
By your patience Aunchient Pistol Fortune is
painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to
signify to you that Fortune is blind and she is
painted also with a wheel to signify to you which
is the moral of it that she is turning and
inconstant and mutability and variation and her
foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone
which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth
the poet makes a most excellent description of it
Fortune is an excellent moral
Fortune is Bardolphs foe and frowns on him
For he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be
A damned death
Let gallows gape for dog let man go free
And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
For pax of little price
Therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice
And let not Bardolphs vital thread be cut
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach
Speak captain for his life and I will thee requite
Aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaning
Why then rejoice therefore
Certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice
at for if look you he were my brother I would
desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put
him to execution for discipline ought to be used
Die and be damnd and figo for thy friendship
It is well
The fig of Spain
Exit
Very good
Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I
remember him now a bawd a cutpurse
Ill assure you a uttered as brave words at the
bridge as you shall see in a summers day But it
is very well what he has spoke to me that is well
I warrant you when time is serve
Why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then
goes to the wars to grace himself at his return
into London under the form of a soldier And such
fellows are perfect in the great commanders names
and they will learn you by rote where services were
done at such and such a sconce at such a breach
at such a convoy who came off bravely who was
shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war
which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what
a beard of the generals cut and a horrid suit of
the camp will do among foaming bottles and
alewashed wits is wonderful to be thought on But
you must learn to know such slanders of the age or
else you may be marvellously mistook
I tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is
not the man that he would gladly make show to the
world he is if I find a hole in his coat I will
tell him my mind
Drum heard
Hark you the king is coming and I must speak with
him from the pridge
Drum and colours Enter KING HENRY GLOUCESTER and Soldiers
God pless your majesty
How now Fluellen camest thou from the bridge
Ay so please your majesty The Duke of Exeter has
very gallantly maintained the pridge the French is
gone off look you and there is gallant and most
prave passages marry th athversary was have
possession of the pridge but he is enforced to
retire and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
pridge I can tell your majesty the duke is a
prave man
What men have you lost Fluellen
The perdition of th athversary hath been very
great reasonable great marry for my part I
think the duke hath lost never a man but one that
is like to be executed for robbing a church one
Bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is
all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o
fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like
a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red
but his nose is executed and his fires out
We would have all such offenders so cut off and we
give express charge that in our marches through the
country there be nothing compelled from the
villages nothing taken but paid for none of the
French upbraided or abused in disdainful language
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner
Tucket Enter MONTJOY
You know me by my habit
Well then I know thee what shall I know of thee
My masters mind
Unfold it
Thus says my king Say thou to Harry of England
Though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage
is a better soldier than rashness Tell him we
could have rebuked him at Harfleur but that we
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice
is imperial England shall repent his folly see
his weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him
therefore consider of his ransom which must
proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we
have lost the disgrace we have digested which in
weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under
For our losses his exchequer is too poor for the
effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too
faint a number and for our disgrace his own
person kneeling at our feet but a weak and
tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
followers whose condemnation is pronounced So far
my king and master so much my office
What is thy name I know thy quality
Montjoy
Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back
And tell thy king I do not seek him now
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment for to say the sooth
Though tis no wisdom to confess so much
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage
My people are with sickness much enfeebled
My numbers lessened and those few I have
Almost no better than so many French
Who when they were in health I tell thee herald
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God
That I do brag thus This your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me I must repent
Go therefore tell thy master here I am
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
My army but a weak and sickly guard
Yet God before tell him we will come on
Though France himself and such another neighbour
Stand in our way Theres for thy labour Montjoy
Go bid thy master well advise himself
If we may pass we will if we be hinderd
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well
The sum of all our answer is but this
We would not seek a battle as we are
Nor as we are we say we will not shun it
So tell your master
I shall deliver so Thanks to your highness
Exit
I hope they will not come upon us now
We are in Gods hand brother not in theirs
March to the bridge it now draws toward night
Beyond the river well encamp ourselves
And on tomorrow bid them march away
Exeunt
Enter the Constable of France the LORD RAMBURES ORLEANS DAUPHIN with others
Tut I have the best armour of the world Would it were day
You have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due
It is the best horse of Europe
Will it never be morning
My lord of Orleans and my lord high constable you
talk of horse and armour
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world
What a long night is this I will not change my
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns
Ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his
entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus
chez les narines de feu When I bestride him I
soar I am a hawk he trots the air the earth
sings when he touches it the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes
Hes of the colour of the nutmeg
And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for
Perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him but
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
may call beasts
Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse
It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
No more cousin
Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary
deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as
fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent
tongues and my horse is argument for them all
tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for
a sovereigns sovereign to ride on and for the
world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
their particular functions and wonder at him I
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus
Wonder of nature
I have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistress
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
courser for my horse is my mistress
Your mistress bears well
Me well which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress
Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
shook your back
So perhaps did yours
Mine was not bridled
O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode
like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in
your straight strossers
You have good judgment in horsemanship
Be warned by me then they that ride so and ride
not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have
my horse to my mistress
I had as lief have my mistress a jade
I tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow
to my mistress
Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et
la truie lavee au bourbier thou makest use of any thing
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any
such proverb so little kin to the purpose
My lord constable the armour that I saw in your tent
tonight are those stars or suns upon it
Stars my lord
Some of them will fall tomorrow I hope
And yet my sky shall not want
That may be for you bear a many superfluously and
twere more honour some were away
Even as your horse bears your praises who would
trot as well were some of your brags dismounted
Would I were able to load him with his desert Will
it never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile and
my way shall be paved with English faces
I will not say so for fear I should be faced out of
my way but I would it were morning for I would
fain be about the ears of the English
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them
Tis midnight Ill go arm myself
Exit
The Dauphin longs for morning
He longs to eat the English
I think he will eat all he kills
By the white hand of my lady hes a gallant prince
Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
He never did harm that I heard of
Nor will do none tomorrow he will keep that good name still
I know him to be valiant
I was told that  by one that knows him better than
you
Whats he
Marry he told me so himself and he said he cared
not who knew it
He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
By my faith sir but it is never any body saw it
but his lackey tis a hooded valour and when it
appears it will bate
Ill will never said well
I will cap that proverb with There is flattery in friendship
And I will take up that with Give the devil his due
Well placed there stands your friend for the
devil have at the very eye of that proverb with A
pox of the devil
You are the better at proverbs by how much A
fools bolt is soon shot
You have shot over
Tis not the first time you were overshot
Enter a Messenger
My lord high constable the English lie within
fifteen hundred paces of your tents
Who hath measured the ground
The Lord Grandpre
A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were
day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for
the dawning as we do
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
England to mope with his fatbrained followers so
far out of his knowledge
If the English had any apprehension they would run away
That they lack for if their heads had any
intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy
headpieces
That island of England breeds very valiant
creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like
rotten apples You may as well say thats a
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion
Just just and the men do sympathize with the
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving
their wits with their wives and then give them
great meals of beef and iron and steel they will
eat like wolves and fight like devils
Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs
to eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm

We shall have each a hundred Englishmen

PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
The hum of either army stilly sounds
That the fixed sentinels almost receive
The secret whispers of each others watch
Fire answers fire and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the others umberd face
Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents
The armourers accomplishing the knights
With busy hammers closing rivets up
Give dreadful note of preparation
The country cocks do crow the clocks do toll
And the third hour of drowsy morning name
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul
The confident and overlusty French
Do the lowrated English play at dice
And chide the cripple tardygaited night
Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
So tediously away The poor condemned English
Like sacrifices by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The mornings danger and their gesture sad
Investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold
The royal captain of this ruind band
Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
Let him cry Praise and glory on his head
For forth he goes and visits all his host
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
And calls them brothers friends and countrymen
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Unto the weary and allwatched night
But freshly looks and overbears attaint
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
That every wretch pining and pale before
Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
A largess universal like the sun
His liberal eye doth give to every one
Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
Behold as may unworthiness define
A little touch of Harry in the night
WhereO for pitywe shall much disgrace
With four or five most vile and ragged foils
Right illdisposed in brawl ridiculous
The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see
Minding true things by what their mockeries be
Exit
Enter KING HENRY BEDFORD and GLOUCESTER
Gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
The greater therefore should our courage be
Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty
There is some soul of goodness in things evil
Would men observingly distil it out
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
Which is both healthful and good husbandry
Besides they are our outward consciences
And preachers to us all admonishing
That we should dress us fairly for our end
Thus may we gather honey from the weed
And make a moral of the devil himself
Enter ERPINGHAM
Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France
Not so my liege this lodging likes me better
Since I may say Now lie I like a king
Tis good for men to love their present pains
Upon example so the spirit is eased
And when the mind is quickend out of doubt
The organs though defunct and dead before
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move
With casted slough and fresh legerity
Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both
Commend me to the princes in our camp
Do my good morrow to them and anon
Desire them an to my pavilion
We shall my liege
Shall I attend your grace
No my good knight
Go with my brothers to my lords of England
I and my bosom must debate awhile
And then I would no other company
The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry

Captain Fluellen
So in the name of Jesu Christ speak lower It is
the greatest admiration of the universal world when
the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the Great you shall
find I warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle
nor pibble pabble in Pompeys camp I warrant you
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the
cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety
of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
Why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also
look you be an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb in your own conscience now
I will speak lower
I pray you and beseech you that you will
Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN
Though it appear a little out of fashion
There is much care and valour in this Welshman
Enter three soldiers JOHN BATES ALEXANDER COURT and MICHAEL WILLIAMS
Brother John Bates is not that the morning which
breaks yonder
I think it be but we have no great cause to desire
the approach of day
We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think
we shall never see the end of it Who goes there
A friend
Under what captain serve you
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I
pray you what thinks he of our estate
Even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be
washed off the next tide
He hath not told his thought to the king
No nor it is not meet he should For though I
speak it to you I think the king is but a man as I
am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the
element shows to him as it doth to me all his
senses have but human conditions his ceremonies
laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and
though his affections are higher mounted than ours
yet when they stoop they stoop with the like
wing Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we
do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
as ours are yet in reason no man should possess
him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing
it should dishearten his army
He may show what outward courage he will but I
believe as cold a night as tis he could wish
himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he
were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here
By my troth I will speak my conscience of the king
I think he would not wish himself any where but
where he is
Then I would he were here alone so should he be
sure to be ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens
minds methinks I could not die any where so
contented as in the kings company his cause being
just and his quarrel honourable
Thats more than we know
Ay or more than we should seek after for we know
enough if we know we are the kings subjects if
his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes
the crime of it out of us
But if the cause be not good the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and
arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join
together at the latter day and cry all We died at
such a place some swearing some crying for a
surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind
them some upon the debts they owe some upon their
children rawly left I am afeard there are few die
well that die in a battle for how can they
charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their
argument Now if these men do not die well it
will be a black matter for the king that led them to
it whom to disobey were against all proportion of
subjection
So if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the
imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be
imposed upon his father that sent him or if a
servant under his masters command transporting a
sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
many irreconciled iniquities you may call the
business of the master the author of the servants
damnation but this is not so the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers the father of his son nor the master of
his servant for they purpose not their death when
they purpose their services Besides there is no
king be his cause never so spotless if it come to
the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all
unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder
some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
perjury some making the wars their bulwark that
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
pillage and robbery Now if these men have
defeated the law and outrun native punishment
though they can outstrip men they have no wings to
fly from God war is his beadle war is vengeance
so that here men are punished for beforebreach of
the kings laws in now the kings quarrel where
they feared the death they have borne life away
and where they would be safe they perish then if
they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited Every
subjects duty is the kings but every subjects
soul is his own Therefore should every soldier in
the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every
mote out of his conscience and dying so death
is to him advantage or not dying the time was
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained
and in him that escapes it were not sin to think
that making God so free an offer He let him
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare
Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon
his own head the king is not to answer it
But I do not desire he should answer for me and
yet I determine to fight lustily for him
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed
Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but
when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we
neer the wiser
If I live to see it I will never trust his word after
You pay him then Thats a perilous shot out of an
eldergun that a poor and private displeasure can
do against a monarch you may as well go about to
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
peacocks feather Youll never trust his word
after come tis a foolish saying
Your reproof is something too round I should be
angry with you if the time were convenient
Let it be a quarrel between us if you live
I embrace it
How shall I know thee again
Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my
bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it I
will make it my quarrel
Heres my glove give me another of thine
There
This will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come
to me and say after tomorrow This is my glove
by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear
If ever I live to see it I will challenge it
Thou darest as well be hanged
Well I will do it though I take thee in the
kings company
Keep thy word fare thee well
Be friends you English fools be friends we have
French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to
one they will beat us for they bear them on their
shoulders but it is no English treason to cut
French crowns and tomorrow the king himself will
be a clipper
Exeunt soldiers
Upon the king let us our lives our souls
Our debts our careful wives
Our children and our sins lay on the king
We must bear all O hard condition
Twinborn with greatness subject to the breath
Of every fool whose sense no more can feel
But his own wringing What infinite heartsease
Must kings neglect that private men enjoy
And what have kings that privates have not too
Save ceremony save general ceremony
And what art thou thou idle ceremony
What kind of god art thou that sufferst more
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
What are thy rents what are thy comings in
O ceremony show me but thy worth
What is thy soul of adoration
Art thou aught else but place degree and form
Creating awe and fear in other men
Wherein thou art less happy being feard
Than they in fearing
What drinkst thou oft instead of homage sweet
But poisond flattery O be sick great greatness
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure
Thinkst thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation
Will it give place to flexure and low bending
Canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee
Command the health of it No thou proud dream
That playst so subtly with a kings repose
I am a king that find thee and I know
Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
The sword the mace the crown imperial
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl
The farced title running fore the king
The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world
No not all these thricegorgeous ceremony
Not all these laid in bed majestical
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
Who with a body filld and vacant mind
Gets him to rest crammd with distressful bread
Never sees horrid night the child of hell
But like a lackey from the rise to set
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse
And follows so the everrunning year
With profitable labour to his grave
And but for ceremony such a wretch
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
Had the forehand and vantage of a king
The slave a member of the countrys peace
Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
Whose hours the peasant best advantages

And on it have bestowd more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay
Who twice aday their witherd hands hold up
Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built

The English are embattled you French peers
To horse you gallant princes straight to horse
Do but behold yon poor and starved band
And your fair show shall suck away their souls
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men
There is not work enough for all our hands
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
To give each naked curtleaxe a stain
That our French gallants shall today draw out
And sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on them
The vapour of our valour will oerturn them
Tis positive gainst all exceptions lords
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
About our squares of battle were enow
To purge this field of such a hilding foe
Though we upon this mountains basis by
Took stand for idle speculation
But that our honours must not Whats to say

Why do you stay so long my lords of France
Yon island carrions desperate of their bones
Illfavouredly become the morning field
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
And our air shakes them passing scornfully
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggard host
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
With torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades
Lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
The gum downroping from their paledead eyes
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
Lies foul with chewd grass still and motionless
And their executors the knavish crows
Fly oer them all impatient for their hour
Description cannot suit itself in words
To demonstrate the life of such a battle
In life so lifeless as it shows itself
They have said their prayers and they stay for death
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
And give their fasting horses provender
And after fight with them
I stay but for my guidon to the field
I will the banner from a trumpet take
And use it for my haste Come come away

O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work today
Whats he that wishes so
My cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin
If we are markd to die we are enow
To do our country loss and if to live
The fewer men the greater share of honour
Gods will I pray thee wish not one man more
By Jove I am not covetous for gold
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost
It yearns me not if men my garments wear
Such outward things dwell not in my desires
But if it be a sin to covet honour
I am the most offending soul alive
No faith my coz wish not a man from England
Gods peace I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more methinks would share from me
For the best hope I have O do not wish one more
Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host
That he which hath no stomach to this fight
Let him depart his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse
We would not die in that mans company
That fears his fellowship to die with us
This day is called the feast of Crispian
He that outlives this day and comes safe home
Will stand a tiptoe when the day is named
And rouse him at the name of Crispian
He that shall live this day and see old age
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
And say Tomorrow is Saint Crispian
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
And say These wounds I had on Crispins day
Old men forget yet all shall be forgot
But hell remember with advantages
What feats he did that day then shall our names
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king Bedford and Exeter
Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester
Be in their flowing cups freshly rememberd
This story shall the good man teach his son
And Crispin Crispian shall neer go by
From this day to the ending of the world
But we in it shall be rememberd
We few we happy few we band of brothers
For he today that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother be he neer so vile
This day shall gentle his condition
And gentlemen in England now abed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispins day
Reenter SALISBURY
My sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
The French are bravely in their battles set
And will with all expedience charge on us

Perish the man whose mind is backward now
Thou dost not wish more help from England coz

Without more help could fight this royal battle
Why now thou hast unwishd five thousand men
Which likes me better than to wish us one
You know your places God be with you all
Tucket Enter MONTJOY
Once more I come to know of thee King Harry
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
Before thy most assured overthrow
For certainly thou art so near the gulf
Thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy
The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
Thy followers of repentance that their souls
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
Must lie and fester
Who hath sent thee now
The Constable of France
I pray thee bear my former answer back
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
Good God why should they mock poor fellows thus
The man that once did sell the lions skin
While the beast lived was killed with hunting him
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves upon the which I trust
Shall witness live in brass of this days work
And those that leave their valiant bones in France
Dying like men though buried in your dunghills
They shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France
Mark then abounding valour in our English
That being dead like to the bullets grazing
Break out into a second course of mischief
Killing in relapse of mortality
Let me speak proudly tell the constable
We are but warriors for the workingday
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirchd
With rainy marching in the painful field
Theres not a piece of feather in our host
Good argument I hope we will not fly
And time hath worn us into slovenry
But by the mass our hearts are in the trim
And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
Theyll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
The gay new coats oer the French soldiers heads
And turn them out of service If they do this
As if God please they shallmy ransom then
Will soon be levied Herald save thou thy labour
Come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
They shall have none I swear but these my joints
Which if they have as I will leave em them
Shall yield them little tell the constable
I shall King Harry And so fare thee well
Thou never shalt hear herald any more

Well have we done thrice valiant countrymen
But alls not done yet keep the French the field
The Duke of York commends him to your majesty
Lives he good uncle thrice within this hour
I saw him down thrice up again and fighting
From helmet to the spur all blood he was
In which array brave soldier doth he lie
Larding the plain and by his bloody side
Yokefellow to his honourowing wounds
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies
Suffolk first died and York all haggled over
Comes to him where in gore he lay insteepd
And takes him by the beard kisses the gashes
That bloodily did spawn upon his face
And cries aloud Tarry dear cousin Suffolk
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven
Tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast
As in this glorious and wellfoughten field
We kept together in our chivalry
Upon these words I came and cheerd him up
He smiled me in the face raught me his hand
And with a feeble gripe says Dear my lord
Commend my service to me sovereign
So did he turn and over Suffolks neck
He threw his wounded arm and kissd his lips
And so espoused to death with blood he seald
A testament of nobleending love
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
Those waters from me which I would have stoppd
But I had not so much of man in me
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears
I blame you not

cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha done
this slaughter besides they have burned and

Why I pray you is not pig great the pig or the

father was called Philip of Macedon as I take it
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn I

between Macedon and Monmouth that the situations
look you is both alike There is a river in
Macedon and there is also moreover a river at
Monmouth it is called Wye at Monmouth but it is
out of my prains what is the name of the other
river but tis all one tis alike as my fingers is
to my fingers and there is salmons in both If you
mark Alexanders life well Harry of Monmouths life
is come after it indifferent well for there is
figures in all things Alexander God knows and
you know in his rages and his furies and his
wraths and his cholers and his moods and his
displeasures and his indignations and also being a
little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and

Our king is not like him in that he never killed

It is not well done mark you now take the tales out
of my mouth ere it is made and finished I speak

Alexander killed his friend Cleitus being in his

Enforced from the old Assyrian slings
Besides well cut the throats of those we have
And not a man of them that we shall take
Shall taste our mercy Go and tell them so
Enter MONTJOY
Here comes the herald of the French my liege
His eyes are humbler than they used to be
How now what means this herald knowst thou not
That I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom
Comest thou again for ransom
No great king
I come to thee for charitable licence
That we may wander oer this bloody field
To look our dead and then to bury them
To sort our nobles from our common men
For many of our princeswoe the while
Lie drownd and soakd in mercenary blood
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
In blood of princes and their wounded steeds
Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters
Killing them twice O give us leave great king
To view the field in safety and dispose
Of their dead bodies
I tell thee truly herald
I know not if the day be ours or no
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
And gallop oer the field
The day is yours
Praised be God and not our strength for it
What is this castle calld that stands hard by
They call it Agincourt
Then call we this the field of Agincourt
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus

Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
That I may prompt them and of such as have
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
Of time of numbers and due course of things
Which cannot in their huge and proper life
Be here presented Now we bear the king
Toward Calais grant him there there seen
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
Athwart the sea Behold the English beach
Pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouthd sea
Which like a mighty whiffler fore the king
Seems to prepare his way so let him land
And solemnly see him set on to London
So swift a pace hath thought that even now
You may imagine him upon Blackheath
Where that his lords desire him to have borne
His bruised helmet and his bended sword
Before him through the city he forbids it
Being free from vainness and selfglorious pride
Giving full trophy signal and ostent
Quite from himself to God But now behold
In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought
How London doth pour out her citizens
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort
Like to the senators of the antique Rome
With the plebeians swarming at their heels
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in
As by a lower but loving likelihood
Were now the general of our gracious empress
As in good time he may from Ireland coming
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword
How many would the peaceful city quit
To welcome him much more and much more cause
Did they this Harry Now in London place him
As yet the lamentation of the French
Invites the King of Englands stay at home
The emperors coming in behalf of France
To order peace between them and omit
All the occurrences whatever chanced
Till Harrys backreturn again to France
There must we bring him and myself have playd
The interim by remembering you tis past
Then brook abridgment and your eyes advance
After your thoughts straight back again to France

Enter at one door KING HENRY EXETER BEDFORD  GLOUCESTER WARWICK WESTMORELAND and other Lords  at another the FRENCH KING QUEEN ISABEL the  PRINCESS KATHARINE ALICE and other Ladies the DUKE of BURGUNDY and his train
Peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
Unto our brother France and to our sister
Health and fair time of day joy and good wishes
To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine
And as a branch and member of this royalty
By whom this great assembly is contrived
We do salute you Duke of Burgundy
And princes French and peers health to you all
Right joyous are we to behold your face
Most worthy brother England fairly met
So are you princes English every one
So happy be the issue brother England
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting
As we are now glad to behold your eyes
Your eyes which hitherto have borne in them
Against the French that met them in their bent
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks
The venom of such looks we fairly hope
Have lost their quality and that this day
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
To cry amen to that thus we appear
You English princes all I do salute you
My duty to you both on equal love
Great Kings of France and England That I have labourd
With all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
To bring your most imperial majesties
Unto this bar and royal interview
Your mightiness on both parts best can witness
Since then my office hath so far prevaild
That face to face and royal eye to eye
You have congreeted let it not disgrace me
If I demand before this royal view
What rub or what impediment there is
Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace
Dear nurse of arts and joyful births
Should not in this best garden of the world
Our fertile France put up her lovely visage
Alas she hath from France too long been chased
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
Corrupting in its own fertility
Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
Unpruned dies her hedges evenpleachd
Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
Put forth disorderd twigs her fallow leas
The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
That should deracinate such savagery
The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
Losing both beauty and utility
And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
Defective in their natures grow to wildness
Even so our houses and ourselves and children
Have lost or do not learn for want of time
The sciences that should become our country
But grow like savagesas soldiers will
That nothing do but meditate on blood
To swearing and stern looks diffused attire
And every thing that seems unnatural
Which to reduce into our former favour
You are assembled and my speech entreats
That I may know the let why gentle Peace
Should not expel these inconveniences
And bless us with her former qualities
If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace
Whose want gives growth to the imperfections
Which you have cited you must buy that peace
With full accord to all our just demands
Whose tenors and particular effects
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands
The king hath heard them to the which as yet
There is no answer made
Well then the peace
Which you before so urged lies in his answer
I have but with a cursorary eye
Oerglanced the articles pleaseth your grace
To appoint some of your council presently
To sit with us once more with better heed
To resurvey them we will suddenly
Pass our accept and peremptory answer
Brother we shall Go uncle Exeter
And brother Clarence and you brother Gloucester
Warwick and Huntingdon go with the king
And take with you free power to ratify
Augment or alter as your wisdoms best
Shall see advantageable for our dignity
Any thing in or out of our demands
And well consign thereto Will you fair sister
Go with the princes or stay here with us
Our gracious brother I will go with them
Haply a womans voice may do some good
When articles too nicely urged be stood on
Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us
She is our capital demand comprised
Within the forerank of our articles
She hath good leave
Exeunt all except HENRY KATHARINE and ALICE
Fair Katharine and most fair
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
Such as will enter at a ladys ear
And plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart
Your majesty shall mock at me I cannot speak your England
O fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with
your French heart I will be glad to hear you
confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do
you like me Kate
Pardonnezmoi I cannot tell vat is like me
An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
Que ditil que je suis semblable a les anges
Oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi ditil
I said so dear Katharine and I must not blush to
affirm it
O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
tromperies
What says she fair one that the tongues of men
are full of deceits
Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
deceits dat is de princess
The princess is the better Englishwoman I faith
Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am
glad thou canst speak no better English for if
thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king
that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
crown I know no ways to mince it in love but
directly to say I love you then if you urge me
farther than to say do you in faith I wear out
my suit Give me your answer i faith do and so
clap hands and a bargain how say you lady
Sauf votre honneur me understand vell
Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I
have neither words nor measure and for the other I
have no strength in measure yet a reasonable
measure in strength If I could win a lady at
leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my
armour on my back under the correction of bragging
be it spoken I should quickly leap into a wife
Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse
for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jackanapes never off But before God
Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
eloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation
only downright oaths which I never use till urged
nor never break for urging If thou canst love a
fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth
sunburning that never looks in his glass for love
of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy
cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou canst
love me for this take me if not to say to thee
that I shall die is true but for thy love by the
Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou
livest dear Kate take a fellow of plain and
uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee
right because he hath not the gift to woo in other
places for these fellows of infinite tongue that
can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do
always reason themselves out again What a
speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A
good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a
black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow
bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax
hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the
moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it
shines bright and never changes but keeps his
course truly If thou would have such a one take
me and take me take a soldier take a soldier
take a king And what sayest thou then to my love
speak my fair and fairly I pray thee
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
No it is not possible you should love the enemy of
France Kate but in loving me you should love
the friend of France for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it I will have it
all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am
yours then yours is France and you are mine
I cannot tell vat is dat
No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am
sure will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried
wife about her husbands neck hardly to be shook
off Je quand sur le possession de France et quand
vous avez le possession de moilet me see what
then Saint Denis be my speeddonc votre est
France et vous etes mienne It is as easy for me
Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
more French I shall never move thee in French
unless it be to laugh at me
Sauf votre honneur le Francois que vous parlez il
est meilleur que lAnglois lequel je parle
No faith ist not Kate but thy speaking of my
tongue and I thine most trulyfalsely must needs
be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou
understand thus much English canst thou love me
I cannot tell
Can any of your neighbours tell Kate Ill ask
them Come I know thou lovest me and at night
when you come into your closet youll question this
gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
your heart but good Kate mock me mercifully the
rather gentle princess because I love thee
cruelly If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get
thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs
prove a good soldierbreeder shall not thou and I
between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a
boy half French half English that shall go to
Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard
shall we not what sayest thou my fair
flowerdeluce
I do not know dat
No tis hereafter to know but now to promise do
but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your
French part of such a boy and for my English moiety
take the word of a king and a bachelor How answer
you la plus belle Katharine du monde mon tres cher
et devin deesse
Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
most sage demoiselle dat is en France
Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in
true English I love thee Kate by which honour I
dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to
flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor
and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew
my fathers ambition he was thinking of civil wars
when he got me therefore was I created with a
stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when
I come to woo ladies I fright them But in faith
Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear
my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of
beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou
hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou
shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better
and therefore tell me most fair Katharine will you
have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress
take me by the hand and say Harry of England I am
thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
ear withal but I will tell thee aloud England is
thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Harry
Plantagenet is thine who though I speak it before
his face if he be not fellow with the best king
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows
Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is
music and thy English broken therefore queen of
all Katharine break thy mind to me in broken
English wilt thou have me
Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere
Nay it will please him well Kate it shall please
him Kate
Den it sall also content me
Upon that I kiss your hand and I call you my queen
Laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez ma foi je
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en
baisant la main dune de votre seigeurie indigne
serviteur excusezmoi je vous supplie mon
trespuissant seigneur
Then I will kiss your lips Kate
Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
leur noces il nest pas la coutume de France
Madam my interpreter what says she
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
FranceI cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish
To kiss
Your majesty entendre bettre que moi
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
before they are married would she say
Oui vraiment
O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear
Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak
list of a countrys fashion we are the makers of
manners Kate and the liberty that follows our
places stops the mouth of all findfaults as I will
do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your
country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently
and yielding
Kissing her
You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
tongues of the French council and they should
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general
petition of monarchs Here comes your father
Reenter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN BURGUNDY and other Lords
God save your majesty my royal cousin teach you
our princess English
I would have her learn my fair cousin how
perfectly I love her and that is good English
Is she not apt
Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
smooth so that having neither the voice nor the
heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up
the spirit of love in her that he will appear in
his true likeness
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you
for that If you would conjure in her you must
make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true
likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you
blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the
virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid
to consign to
Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces
They are then excused my lord when they see not
what they do
Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking
I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will
teach her to know my meaning for maids well
summered and warm kept are like flies at
Bartholomewtide blind though they have their
eyes and then they will endure handling which
before would not abide looking on
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer
and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the
latter end and she must be blind too
As love is my lord before it loves
It is so and you may some of you thank love for
my blindness who cannot see many a fair French city
for one fair French maid that stands in my way
Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
turned into a maid for they are all girdled with
maiden walls that war hath never entered
Shall Kate be my wife
So please you
I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may
wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for
my wish shall show me the way to my will
We have consented to all terms of reason
Ist so my lords of England
The king hath granted every article
His daughter first and then in sequel all
According to their firm proposed natures
Only he hath not yet subscribed this
Where your majesty demands that the King of France
having any occasion to write for matter of grant
shall name your highness in this form and with this
addition in French Notre trescher fils Henri Roi
dAngleterre Heritier de France and thus in
Latin Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus Rex
Angliae et Haeres Franciae
Nor this I have not brother so denied
But your request shall make me let it pass
I pray you then in love and dear alliance
Let that one article rank with the rest
And thereupon give me your daughter
Take her fair son and from her blood raise up
Issue to me that the contending kingdoms
Of France and England whose very shores look pale
With envy of each others happiness
May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
Plant neighbourhood and Christianlike accord
In their sweet bosoms that never war advance
His bleeding sword twixt England and fair France
Amen
Now welcome Kate and bear me witness all
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen
Flourish
God the best maker of all marriages
Combine your hearts in one your realms in one
As man and wife being two are one in love
So be there twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
That never may ill office or fell jealousy
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
To make divorce of their incorporate league
That English may as French French Englishmen
Receive each other God speak this Amen
Amen
Prepare we for our marriageon which day
My Lord of Burgundy well take your oath
And all the peers for surety of our leagues
Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be

EPILOGUE
Enter Chorus
Thus far with rough and allunable pen
Our bending author hath pursued the story
In little room confining mighty men
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory
Small time but in that small most greatly lived
This star of England Fortune made his sword
By which the worlds best garden be achieved
And of it left his son imperial lord
Henry the Sixth in infant bands crownd King
Of France and England did this king succeed
Whose state so many had the managing
That they lost France and made his England bleed
Which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake
In your fair minds let this acceptance take

PROLOGUE
I come no more to make you laugh things now
That bear a weighty and a serious brow
Sad high and working full of state and woe
We now present Those that can pity here
May if they think it well let fall a tear
The subject will deserve it Such as give
Their money out of hope they may believe
May here find truth too Those that come to see
Only a show or two and so agree
The play may pass if they be still and willing
Ill undertake may see away their shilling
Richly in two short hours Only they
That come to hear a merry bawdy play
A noise of targets or to see a fellow
In a long motley coat guarded with yellow
Will be deceived for gentle hearers know
To rank our chosen truth with such a show
As fool and fight is beside forfeiting
Our own brains and the opinion that we bring
To make that only true we now intend
Will leave us never an understanding friend
Therefore for goodness sake and as you are known
The first and happiest hearers of the town
Be sad as we would make ye think ye see
The very persons of our noble story
As they were living think you see them great
And followd with the general throng and sweat
Of thousand friends then in a moment see
How soon this mightiness meets misery
And if you can be merry then Ill say
A man may weep upon his weddingday
Enter NORFOLK at one door at the other BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY
Good morrow and well met How have ye done
Since last we saw in France
I thank your grace
Healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
Of what I saw there
An untimely ague
Stayd me a prisoner in my chamber when
Those suns of glory those two lights of men
Met in the vale of Andren
Twixt Guynes and Arde
I was then present saw them salute on horseback
Beheld them when they lighted how they clung
In their embracement as they grew together
Which had they what four throned ones could have weighd
Such a compounded one
All the whole time
I was my chambers prisoner
Then you lost
The view of earthly glory men might say
Till this time pomp was single but now married
To one above itself Each following day
Became the next days master till the last
Made former wonders its Today the French
All clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
Shone down the English and tomorrow they
Made Britain India every man that stood
Showd like a mine Their dwarfish pages were
As cherubins all guilt the madams too
Not used to toil did almost sweat to bear
The pride upon them that their very labour
Was to them as a painting now this masque
Was cried incomparable and the ensuing night
Made it a fool and beggar The two kings
Equal in lustre were now best now worst
As presence did present them him in eye
Still him in praise and being present both
Twas said they saw but one and no discerner
Durst wag his tongue in censure When these suns
For so they phrase emby their heralds challenged
The noble spirits to arms they did perform
Beyond thoughts compass that former fabulous story
Being now seen possible enough got credit
That Bevis was believed
O you go far
As I belong to worship and affect
Would by a good discourser lose some life
To the disposing of it nought rebelld
Order gave each thing view the office did
Distinctly his full function
Who did guide
I mean who set the body and the limbs
Of this great sport together as you guess
One certes that promises no element
In such a business
I pray you who my lord
All this was orderd by the good discretion
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York
The devil speed him no mans pie is freed
From his ambitious finger What had he
To do in these fierce vanities I wonder
That such a keech can with his very bulk
Take up the rays o the beneficial sun
And keep it from the earth
Surely sir
Theres in him stuff that puts him to these ends
For being not proppd by ancestry whose grace
Chalks successors their way nor calld upon
For high feats done to the crown neither allied
For eminent assistants but spiderlike
Out of his selfdrawing web he gives us note
The force of his own merit makes his way
A gift that heaven gives for him which buys
A place next to the king
I cannot tell
What heaven hath given himlet some graver eye
Pierce into that but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him whence has he that
If not from hell the devil is a niggard
Or has given all before and he begins
A new hell in himself
Why the devil
Upon this French going out took he upon him
Without the privity o the king to appoint
Who should attend on him He makes up the file
Of all the gentry for the most part such
To whom as great a charge as little honour
He meant to lay upon and his own letter
The honourable board of council out
Must fetch him in the papers
I do know
Kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
By this so sickened their estates that never
They shall abound as formerly
O many
Have broke their backs with laying manors on em
For this great journey What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poor issue
Grievingly I think
The peace between the French and us not values
The cost that did conclude it
Every man
After the hideous storm that followd was
A thing inspired and not consulting broke
Into a general prophecy That this tempest
Dashing the garment of this peace aboded
The sudden breach ont
Which is budded out
For France hath flawd the league and hath attachd
Our merchants goods at Bourdeaux
Is it therefore
The ambassador is silenced
Marry ist
A proper title of a peace and purchased
At a superfluous rate
Why all this business
Our reverend cardinal carried
Like it your grace
The state takes notice of the private difference
Betwixt you and the cardinal I advise you
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Honour and plenteous safetythat you read
The cardinals malice and his potency
Together to consider further that
What his high hatred would effect wants not
A minister in his power You know his nature
That hes revengeful and I know his sword
Hath a sharp edge its long and t may be said
It reaches far and where twill not extend
Thither he darts it Bosom up my counsel
Youll find it wholesome Lo where comes that rock
That I advise your shunning
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY the purse borne before him  certain of the Guard and two Secretaries with  papers CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM and BUCKINGHAM on him both full of disdain
The Duke of Buckinghams surveyor ha
Wheres his examination
Here so please you
Is he in person ready
Ay please your grace
Well we shall then know more and Buckingham
Shall lessen this big look
Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train
This butchers cur is venommouthd and I
Have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
Not wake him in his slumber A beggars book
Outworths a nobles blood
What are you chafed
Ask God for temperance thats the appliance only
Which your disease requires
I read ins looks
Matter against me and his eye reviled
Me as his abject object at this instant
He bores me with some trick hes gone to the king
Ill follow and outstare him
Stay my lord
And let your reason with your choler question
What tis you go about to climb steep hills
Requires slow pace at first anger is like
A fullhot horse who being allowd his way
Selfmettle tires him Not a man in England
Can advise me like you be to yourself
As you would to your friend
Ill to the king
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
This Ipswich fellows insolence or proclaim
Theres difference in no persons
Be advised
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
That it do singe yourself we may outrun
By violent swiftness that which we run at
And lose by overrunning Know you not
The fire that mounts the liquor til run oer
In seeming to augment it wastes it Be advised
I say again there is no English soul
More stronger to direct you than yourself
If with the sap of reason you would quench
Or but allay the fire of passion
Sir
I am thankful to you and Ill go along
By your prescription but this topproud fellow
Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
From sincere motions by intelligence
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
We see each grain of gravel I do know
To be corrupt and treasonous
Say not treasonous
To the king Ill sayt and make my vouch as strong
As shore of rock Attend This holy fox
Or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravenous
As he is subtle and as prone to mischief
As able to performt his mind and place
Infecting one another yea reciprocally
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home suggests the king our master
To this last costly treaty the interview
That swallowd so much treasure and like a glass
Did break i the rinsing
Faith and so it did
Pray give me favour sir This cunning cardinal
The articles o the combination drew
As himself pleased and they were ratified
As he cried Thus let be to as much end
As give a crutch to the dead but our countcardinal
Has done this and tis well for worthy Wolsey
Who cannot err he did it Now this follows
Which as I take it is a kind of puppy
To the old dam treasonCharles the emperor
Under pretence to see the queen his aunt
For twas indeed his colour but he came
To whisper Wolseyhere makes visitation
His fears were that the interview betwixt
England and France might through their amity
Breed him some prejudice for from this league
Peepd harms that menaced him he privily
Deals with our cardinal and as I trow
Which I do well for I am sure the emperor
Paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted
Ere it was askd but when the way was made
And paved with gold the emperor thus desired
That he would please to alter the kings course
And break the foresaid peace Let the king know
As soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
And for his own advantage
I am sorry
To hear this of him and could wish he were
Something mistaken int
No not a syllable
I  do pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appear in proof
Enter BRANDON a Sergeantatarms before him and two or three of the Guard
Your office sergeant execute it

The king to attach Lord Montacute and the bodies
Of the dukes confessor John de la Car
One Gilbert Peck his chancellor
So so
These are the limbs o the plot no more I hope
A monk o the Chartreux
O Nicholas Hopkins

Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on
By darkening my clear sun My lord farewell
Exeunt
Cornets Enter KING HENRY VIII leaning on  CARDINAL WOLSEYs shoulder the Nobles and LOVELL  CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIIIs feet on his right side
My life itself and the best heart of it
Thanks you for this great care I stood i the level
Of a fullcharged confederacy and give thanks
To you that choked it Let be calld before us
That gentleman of Buckinghams in person
Ill hear him his confessions justify
And point by point the treasons of his master
He shall again relate
A noise within crying Room for the Queen Enter  QUEEN KATHARINE ushered by NORFOLK and SUFFOLK  she kneels KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state takes her up kisses and placeth her by him
Nay we must longer kneel I am a suitor
Arise and take place by us half your suit
Never name to us you have half our power
The other moiety ere you ask is given
Repeat your will and take it
Thank your majesty
That you would love yourself and in that love
Not unconsiderd leave your honour nor
The dignity of your office is the point
Of my petition
Lady mine proceed
I am solicited not by a few
And those of true condition that your subjects
Are in great grievance there have been commissions
Sent down among em which hath flawd the heart
Of all their loyalties wherein although
My good lord cardinal they vent reproaches
Most bitterly on you as putter on
Whose honour heaven shield from soileven he
escapes not
Language unmannerly yea such which breaks
The sides of loyalty and almost appears
In loud rebellion
Not almost appears
It doth appear for upon these taxations
The clothiers all not able to maintain
The many to them longing have put off
The spinsters carders fullers weavers who
Unfit for other life compelld by hunger
And lack of other means in desperate manner
Daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar
And danger serves among then
Taxation
Wherein and what taxation My lord cardinal
You that are blamed for it alike with us
Know you of this taxation
Please you sir
I know but of a single part in aught
Pertains to the state and front but in that file
Where others tell steps with me
No my lord
You know no more than others but you frame
Things that are known alike which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them and yet must
Whereof my sovereign would have note they are
Most pestilent to the bearing and to bear em
The back is sacrifice to the load They say
They are devised by you or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation
The nature of it in what kind lets know
I am much too venturous
In tempting of your patience but am boldend
Under your promised pardon The subjects grief
Comes through commissions which compel from each
The sixth part of his substance to be levied
Without delay and the pretence for this
Is named your wars in France this makes bold mouths
Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them their curses now
Live where their prayers did and its come to pass
To each incensed will I would your highness
Would give it quick consideration for
There is no primer business
By my life
This is against our pleasure
And for me
I have no further gone in this than by
A single voice and that not passd me but
By learned approbation of the judges If I am
Traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know
My faculties nor person yet will be
The chronicles of my doing let me say
Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake
That virtue must go through We must not stint
To cope malicious censurers which ever
As ravenous fishes do a vessel follow
That is newtrimmd but benefit no further
Than vainly longing What we oft do best
By sick interpreters once weak ones is
Not ours or not allowd what worst as oft
Hitting a grosser quality is cried up
In fear our motion will be mockd or carpd at
We should take root here where we sit or sit
Statestatues only
Things done well
And with a care exempt themselves from fear
Things done without example in their issue
Are to be feard Have you a precedent
Of this commission I believe not any
We must not rend our subjects from our laws
And stick them in our will Sixth part of each
A trembling contribution Why we take
From every tree lop bark and part o the timber
And though we leave it with a root thus hackd
The air will drink the sap To every county
Where this is questiond send our letters with
Free pardon to each man that has denied
The force of this commission pray look tot
I put it to your care
A word with you
To the Secretary
Let there be letters writ to every shire
Of the kings grace and pardon The grieved commons
Hardly conceive of me let it be noised
That through our intercession this revokement
And pardon comes I shall anon advise you
Further in the proceeding
Exit Secretary
Enter Surveyor
I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Is run in your displeasure
It grieves many
The gentleman is learnd and a most rare speaker
To nature none more bound his training such
That he may furnish and instruct great teachers
And never seek for aid out of himself Yet see
When these so noble benefits shall prove
Not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt
They turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
Than ever they were fair This man so complete
Who was enrolld mongst wonders and when we
Almost with ravishd listening could not find
His hour of speech a minute he my lady
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
That once were his and is become as black
As if besmeard in hell Sit by us you shall hear
This was his gentleman in trustof him
Things to strike honour sad Bid him recount
We cannot feel too little hear too much
Stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
Most like a careful subject have collected
Out of the Duke of Buckingham
Speak freely
First it was usual with him every day
It would infect his speech that if the king
Should without issue die hell carry it so
To make the sceptre his these very words
Ive heard him utter to his soninlaw
Lord Abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced
Revenge upon the cardinal
Please your highness note
This dangerous conception in this point
Not friended by by his wish to your high person
His will is most malignant and it stretches
Beyond you to your friends
My learnd lord cardinal
Deliver all with charity
Speak on
How grounded he his title to the crown
Upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him
At any time speak aught
He was brought to this
By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins
What was that Hopkins
Sir a Chartreux friar
His confessor who fed him every minute
With words of sovereignty
How knowst thou this
Not long before your highness sped to France
The duke being at the Rose within the parish
Saint Lawrence Poultney did of me demand
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French journey I replied
Men feard the French would prove perfidious
To the kings danger Presently the duke
Said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
Twould prove the verity of certain words
Spoke by a holy monk that oft says he
Hath sent to me wishing me to permit
John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour
To hear from him a matter of some moment
Whom after under the confessions seal
He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
My chaplain to no creature living but
To me should utter with demure confidence
This pausingly ensued neither the king nors heirs
Tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive
To gain the love o the commonalty the duke
Shall govern England
If I know you well
You were the dukes surveyor and lost your office
On the complaint o the tenants take good heed
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul I say take heed
Yes heartily beseech you
Let him on
Go forward
On my soul Ill speak but truth
I told my lord the duke by the devils illusions
The monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him
To ruminate on this so far until
It forged him some design which being believed
It was much like to do he answerd Tush
It can do me no damage adding further
That had the king in his last sickness faild
The cardinals and Sir Thomas Lovells heads
Should have gone off
Ha what so rank Ah ha
Theres mischief in this man canst thou say further
I can my liege
Proceed
Being at Greenwich
After your highness had reproved the duke
About Sir William Blomer
I remember
Of such a time being my sworn servant
The duke retaind him his But on what hence
If quoth he I for this had been committed
As to the Tower I thought I would have playd
The usurper Richard who being at Salisbury
Made suit to come ins presence which if granted
As he made semblance of his duty would
Have put his knife to him
A giant traitor
Now madam may his highness live in freedom
and this man out of prison
God mend all
Theres something more would out of thee what sayst
After the duke his father with the knife
He stretchd him and with one hand on his dagger
Another spread ons breast mounting his eyes
He did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor
Waswere he evil used he would outgo
His father by as much as a performance
Does an irresolute purpose
Theres his period
To sheathe his knife in us He is attachd
Call him to present trial if he may
Find mercy in the law tis his if none
Let him not seek t of us by day and night
Hes traitor to the height
Exeunt
Enter Chamberlain and SANDS
Ist possible the spells of France should juggle
Men into such strange mysteries
New customs
Though they be never so ridiculous
Nay let em be unmanly yet are followd
As far as I see all the good our English
Have got by the late voyage is but merely
A fit or two o the face but they are shrewd ones
For when they hold em you would swear directly
Their very noses had been counsellors
To Pepin or Clotharius they keep state so
They have all new legs and lame ones one would take it
That never saw em pace before the spavin
Or springhalt reignd among em
Death my lord
Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too
That sure theyve worn out Christendom
Enter LOVELL
How now
What news Sir Thomas Lovell
Faith my lord
I hear of none but the new proclamation
Thats clappd upon the courtgate
What ist for
The reformation of our travelld gallants
That fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors
Im glad tis there now I would pray our monsieurs
To think an English courtier may be wise
And never see the Louvre
They must either
For so run the conditions leave those remnants
Of fool and feather that they got in France
With all their honourable point of ignorance
Pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks
Abusing better men than they can be
Out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean
The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings
Short blisterd breeches and those types of travel
And understand again like honest men
Or pack to their old playfellows there I take it
They may cum privilegio wear away
The lag end of their lewdness and be laughd at
Tis time to give em physic their diseases
Are grown so catching
What a loss our ladies
Will have of these trim vanities
Ay marry
There will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresons
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow
The devil fiddle em I am glad they are going
For sure theres no converting of em now
An honest country lord as I am beaten
A long time out of play may bring his plainsong
And have an hour of hearing and byr lady
Held current music too
Well said Lord Sands
Your colts tooth is not cast yet
No my lord
Nor shall not while I have a stump
Sir Thomas
Whither were you agoing
To the cardinals
Your lordship is a guest too
O tis true
This night he makes a supper and a great one
To many lords and ladies there will be
The beauty of this kingdom Ill assure you
That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us
His dews fall every where
No doubt hes noble
He had a black mouth that said other of him
He may my lord has wherewithal in him
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine
Men of his way should be most liberal
They are set here for examples
True they are so
But few now give so great ones My barge stays

We shall be late else which I would not be
For I was spoke to with Sir Henry Guildford
This night to be comptrollers

A noble company what are their pleasures
Because they speak no English thus they prayd
To tell your grace that having heard by fame

To drink to these fair ladies and a measure
To lead em once again and then lets dream
Whos best in favour Let the music knock it
Exeunt with trumpets
Enter two Gentlemen meeting
Whither away so fast
O God save ye
Even to the hall to hear what shall become
Of the great Duke of Buckingham
Ill save you
That labour sir Alls now done but the ceremony
Of bringing back the prisoner
Were you there
Yes indeed was I
Pray speak what has happend
You may guess quickly what
Is he found guilty
Yes truly is he and condemnd upont
I am sorry fort
So are a number more
But pray how passd it
Ill tell you in a little The great duke
Came to the bar where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law
The kings attorney on the contrary
Urged on the examinations proofs confessions
Of divers witnesses which the duke desired
To have brought viva voce to his face
At which appeard against him his surveyor
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Car
Confessor to him with that devilmonk
Hopkins that made this mischief
That was he
That fed him with his prophecies
The same
All these accused him strongly which he fain
Would have flung from him but indeed he could not
And so his peers upon this evidence
Have found him guilty of high treason Much
He spoke and learnedly for life but all
Was either pitied in him or forgotten
After all this how did he bear himself
When he was brought again to the bar to hear
His knell rung out his judgment he was stirrd
With such an agony he sweat extremely
And something spoke in choler ill and hasty
But he fell to himself again and sweetly
In all the rest showd a most noble patience
I do not think he fears death
Sure he does not
He never was so womanish the cause
He may a little grieve at
Certainly
The cardinal is the end of this
Tis likely
By all conjectures first Kildares attainder
Then deputy of Ireland who removed
Earl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too
Lest he should help his father
That trick of state
Was a deep envious one
At his return
No doubt he will requite it This is noted
And generally whoever the king favours
The cardinal instantly will find employment
And far enough from court too
All the commons
Hate him perniciously and o my conscience
Wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
They love and dote on call him bounteous Buckingham
The mirror of all courtesy
Stay there sir
And see the noble ruind man you speak of
Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment tipstaves  before him the axe with the edge towards him  halberds on each side accompanied with LOVELL VAUX SANDS and common people
Lets stand close and behold him
All good people
You that thus far have come to pity me
Hear what I say and then go home and lose me
I have this day received a traitors judgment
And by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
And if I have a co nscience let it sink me
Even as the axe falls if I be not faithful
The law I bear no malice for my death
T has done upon the premises but justice
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians
Be what they will I heartily forgive em
Yet let em look they glory not in mischief
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men
For then my guiltless blood must cry against em
For further life in this world I neer hope
Nor will I sue although the king have mercies
More than I dare make faults You few that loved me
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham
His noble friends and fellows whom to leave
Is only bitter to him only dying
Go with me like good angels to my end
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
And lift my soul to heaven Lead on o Gods name
I do beseech your grace for charity
If ever any malice in your heart
Were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
Sir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you
As I would be forgiven I forgive all
There cannot be those numberless offences
Gainst me that I cannot take peace with
no black envy
Shall mark my grave Commend me to his grace
And if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him
You met him half in heaven my vows and prayers
Yet are the kings and till my soul forsake
Shall cry for blessings on him may he live
Longer than I have time to tell his years
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be
And when old time shall lead him to his end
Goodness and he fill up one monument
To the water side I must conduct your grace
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux
Who undertakes you to your end
Prepare there
The duke is coming see the barge be ready
And fit it with such furniture as suits
The greatness of his person
Nay Sir Nicholas
Let it alone my state now will but mock me
When I came hither I was lord high constable
And Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun
Yet I am richer than my base accusers
That never knew what truth meant I now seal it
And with that blood will make em one day groan fort
My noble father Henry of Buckingham
Who first raised head against usurping Richard
Flying for succor to his servant Banister
Being distressd was by that wretch betrayd
And without trial fell Gods peace be with him
Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying
My fathers loss like a most royal prince
Restored me to my honours and out of ruins
Made my name once more noble Now his son
Henry the Eighth life honour name and all
That made me happy at one stroke has taken
For ever from the world I had my trial
And must needs say a noble one which makes me
A little happier than my wretched father
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
Fell by our servants by those men we loved most
A most unnatural and faithless service
Heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
This from a dying man receive as certain
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
And give your hearts to when they once perceive
The least rub in your fortunes fall away
Like water from ye never found again
But where they mean to sink ye All good people
Pray for me I must now forsake ye the last hour
Of my long weary life is come upon me Farewell
And when you would say something that is sad
Speak how I fell I have done and God forgive me
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train
O this is full of pity Sir it calls
I fear too many curses on their beads
That were the authors
If the duke be guiltless
Tis full of woe yet I can give you inkling
Of an ensuing evil if it fall
Greater than this
Good angels keep it from us
What may it be You do not doubt my faith sir
This secret is so weighty twill require
A strong faith to conceal it
Let me have it
I do not talk much
I am confident
You shall sir did you not of late days hear
A buzzing of a separation
Between the king and Katharine
Yes but it held not
For when the king once heard it out of anger
He sent command to the lord mayor straight
To stop the rumor and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it
But that slander sir
Is found a truth now for it grows again
Fresher than eer it was and held for certain
The king will venture at it Either the cardinal
Or some about him near have out of malice
To the good queen possessd him with a scruple
That will undo her to confirm this too
Cardinal Campeius is arrived and lately
As all think for this business
Tis the cardinal
And merely to revenge him on the emperor
For not bestowing on him at his asking
The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed
I think you have hit the mark but ist not cruel
That she should feel the smart of this The cardinal
Will have his will and she must fall
Tis woful
We are too open here to argue this
Lets think in private more
Exeunt
Enter Chamberlain reading a letter
My lord the horses your lordship sent for with
all the care I had I saw well chosen ridden and
furnished They were young and handsome and of the
best breed in the north When they were ready to
set out for London a man of my lord cardinals by
commission and main power took em from me with
this reason His master would be served before a
subject if not before the king which stopped our
mouths sir
I fear he will indeed well let him have them
He will have all I think
Enter to Chamberlain NORFOLK and SUFFOLK
Well met my lord chamberlain
Good day to both your graces
How is the king employd
I left him private
Full of sad thoughts and troubles
Whats the cause
It seems the marriage with his brothers wife
Has crept too near his conscience
No his conscience
Has crept too near another lady
Tis so
This is the cardinals doing the kingcardinal
That blind priest like the eldest son of fortune
Turns what he list The king will know him one day
Pray God he do hell never know himself else
How holily he works in all his business
And with what zeal for now he has crackd the league
Between us and the emperor the queens great nephew
He dives into the kings soul and there scatters
Dangers doubts wringing of the conscience
Fears and despairs and all these for his marriage
And out of all these to restore the king
He counsels a divorce a loss of her
That like a jewel has hung twenty years
About his neck yet never lost her lustre
Of her that loves him with that excellence
That angels love good men with even of her
That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls
Will bless the king and is not this course pious
Heaven keep me from such counsel Tis most true
These news are every where every tongue speaks em
And every true heart weeps fort all that dare
Look into these affairs see this main end
The French kings sister Heaven will one day open
The kings eyes that so long have slept upon
This bold bad man
And free us from his slavery
We had need pray
And heartily for our deliverance
Or this imperious man will work us all
From princes into pages all mens honours
Lie like one lump before him to be fashiond
Into what pitch he please
For me my lords
I love him not nor fear him theres my creed
As I am made without him so Ill stand
If the king please his curses and his blessings
Touch me alike theyre breath I not believe in
I knew him and I know him so I leave him
To him that made him proud the pope
Lets in
And with some other business put the king
From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him
My lord youll bear us company
Excuse me
The king has sent me otherwhere besides
Youll find a most unfit time to disturb him
Health to your lordships
Thanks my good lord chamberlain
Exit Chamberlain and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain and sits reading pensively
How sad he looks sure he is much afflicted
Whos there ha
Pray God he be not angry
Whos there I say How dare you thrust yourselves
Into my private meditations

Malice neer meant our breach of duty this way

Aside to NORFOLK          I another
Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK
Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom
Above all princes in committing freely
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom
Who can be angry now what envy reach you
The Spaniard tied blood and favour to her
Must now confess if they have any goodness
The trial just and noble All the clerks
I mean the learned ones in Christian kingdoms
Have their free voices Rome the nurse of judgment
Invited by your noble self hath sent
One general tongue unto us this good man
This just and learned priest Cardinal Campeius
Whom once more I present unto your highness
And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome
And thank the holy conclave for their loves
They have sent me such a man I would have wishd for
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers loves
You are so noble To your highness hand
I tender my commission by whose virtue
The court of Rome commanding you my lord
Cardinal of York are joind with me their servant
In the unpartial judging of this business
Two equal men The queen shall be acquainted
Forthwith for what you come Wheres Gardiner
I know your majesty has always loved her
So dear in heart not to deny her that
A woman of less place might ask by law
Scholars allowd freely to argue for her
Ay and the best she shall have and my favour
To him that does best God forbid else Cardinal
Prithee call Gardiner to me my new secretary
I find him a fit fellow
Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY
Reenter CARDINAL WOLSEY with GARDINER
Aside to GARDINER  Give me your hand much joy and
favour to you
You are the kings now
Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY
But to be commanded
For ever by your grace whose hand has raised me
Come hither Gardiner
Walks and whispers
My Lord of York was not one Doctor Pace
In this mans place before him
Yes he was
Was he not held a learned man
Yes surely
Believe me theres an ill opinion spread then
Even of yourself lord cardinal
How of me
They will not stick to say you envied him
And fearing he would rise he was so virtuous
Kept him a foreign man still which so grieved him
That he ran mad and died
Heavens peace be with him
Thats Christian care enough for living murmurers
Theres places of rebuke He was a fool
For he would needs be virtuous that good fellow
If I command him follows my appointment
I will have none so near else Learn this brother
We live not to be gripd by meaner persons
Deliver this with modesty to the queen
Exit GARDINER
The most convenient place that I can think of
For such receipt of learning is BlackFriars
There ye shall meet about this weighty business
My Wolsey see it furnishd O my lord
Would it not grieve an able man to leave
So sweet a bedfellow But conscience conscience
O tis a tender place and I must leave her
Exeunt
Enter ANNE and an Old Lady
Not for that neither heres the pang that pinches
His highness having lived so long with her and she
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her by my life
She never knew harmdoing O now after
So many courses of the sun enthroned
Still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
To leave a thousandfold more bitter than
Tis sweet at first to acquireafter this process
To give her the avaunt it is a pity
Would move a monster
Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her
O Gods will much better
She neer had known pomp thought be temporal
Yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce
It from the bearer tis a sufferance panging
As soul and bodys severing
Alas poor lady
Shes a stranger now again
So much the more
Must pity drop upon her Verily
I swear tis better to be lowly born
And range with humble livers in content
Than to be perkd up in a glistering grief
And wear a golden sorrow
Our content
Is our best having
By my troth and maidenhead
I would not be a queen
Beshrew me I would
And venture maidenhead fort and so would you
For all this spice of your hypocrisy
You that have so fair parts of woman on you
Have too a womans heart which ever yet
Affected eminence wealth sovereignty
Which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts
Saving your mincing the capacity
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
If you might please to stretch it
Nay good troth
Yes troth and troth you would not be a queen
No not for all the riches under heaven
Old LadyTis strange a threepence bowd would hire me
Old as I am to queen it but I pray you
What think you of a duchess have you limbs
To bear that load of title
No in truth
Then you are weakly made pluck off a little
I would not be a young count in your way
For more than blushing comes to if your back
Cannot vouchsafe this burthentis too weak
Ever to get a boy
How you do talk
I swear again I would not be a queen
For all the world
In faith for little England
Yould venture an emballing I myself
Would for Carnarvonshire although there longd
No more to the crown but that Lo who comes here
Enter Chamberlain
Good morrow ladies What weret worth to know
The secret of your conference
My good lord
Not your demand it values not your asking
Our mistress sorrows we were pitying
It was a gentle business and becoming
All will be well
Now I pray God amen
You bear a gentle mind and heavenly blessings
Follow such creatures That you may fair lady
Perceive I speak sincerely and high notes
Taen of your many virtues the kings majesty
Commends his good opinion of you and
Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
Than Marchioness of Pembroke to which title
A thousand pound a year annual support
Out of his grace he adds
I do not know
What kind of my obedience I should tender
More than my all is nothing nor my prayers
Are not words duly hallowd nor my wishes
More worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes
Are all I can return Beseech your lordship
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience
As from a blushing handmaid to his highness
Whose health and royalty I pray for
Lady
I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
The king hath of you
Aside
I have perused her well
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
That they have caught the king and who knows yet
But from this lady may proceed a gem
To lighten all this isle Ill to the king
And say I spoke with you
Exit Chamberlain
My honourd lord
Why this it is see see
I have been begging sixteen years in court
Am yet a courtier beggarly nor could
Come pat betwixt too early and too late
For any suit of pounds and you O fate
A very freshfish herefie fie fie upon
This compelld fortunehave your mouth filld up
Before you open it
This is strange to me
How tastes it is it bitter forty pence no
There was a lady once tis an old story
That would not be a queen that would she not
For all the mud in Egypt have you heard it
Come you are pleasant
With your theme I could
Oermount the lark The Marchioness of Pembroke
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect
No other obligation By my life
That promises moe thousands honours train
Is longer than his foreskirt By this time
I know your back will bear a duchess say
Are you not stronger than you were
Good lady
Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy
And leave me out ont Would I had no being
If this salute my blood a jot it faints me
To think what follows
The queen is comfortless and we forgetful
In our long absence pray do not deliver
What here youve heard to her
What do you think me

Sir I desire you do me right and justice
And to bestow your pity on me for
I am a most poor woman and a stranger
Born out of your dominions having here
No judge indifferent nor no more assurance
Of equal friendship and proceeding Alas sir
In what have I offended you what cause
Hath my behavior given to your displeasure
That thus you should proceed to put me off
And take your good grace from me Heaven witness
I have been to you a true and humble wife
At all times to your will conformable
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike
Yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry
As I saw it inclined when was the hour
I ever contradicted your desire
Or made it not mine too Or which of your friends
Have I not strove to love although I knew
He were mine enemy what friend of mine
That had to him derived your anger did I
Continue in my liking nay gave notice
He was from thence discharged Sir call to mind
That I have been your wife in this obedience
Upward of twenty years and have been blest
With many children by you if in the course
And process of this time you can report
And prove it too against mine honour aught
My bond to wedlock or my love and duty
Against your sacred person in Gods name
Turn me away and let the foulst contempt
Shut door upon me and so give me up
To the sharpst kind of justice Please you sir
The king your father was reputed for
A prince most prudent of an excellent
And unmatchd wit and judgment Ferdinand
My father king of Spain was reckond one
The wisest prince that there had reignd by many
A year before it is not to be questiond
That they had gatherd a wise council to them
Of every realm that did debate this business
Who deemd our marriage lawful wherefore I humbly
Beseech you sir to spare me till I may
Be by my friends in Spain advised whose counsel
I will implore if not i the name of God
Your pleasure be fulfilld
You have here lady
And of your choice these reverend fathers men
Of singular integrity and learning
Yea the elect o the land who are assembled
To plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless
That longer you desire the court as well
For your own quiet as to rectify
What is unsettled in the king
His grace
Hath spoken well and justly therefore madam
Its fit this royal session do proceed
And that without delay their arguments
Be now produced and heard
Lord cardinal
To you I speak
Your pleasure madam
Sir
I am about to weep but thinking that
We are a queen or long have dreamd so certain
The daughter of a king my drops of tears
Ill turn to sparks of fire
Be patient yet
I will when you are humble nay before
Or God will punish me I do believe
Induced by potent circumstances that
You are mine enemy and make my challenge
You shall not be my judge for it is you
Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me
Which Gods dew quench Therefore I say again
I utterly abhor yea from my soul
Refuse you for my judge whom yet once more
I hold my most malicious foe and think not
At all a friend to truth
I do profess
You speak not like yourself who ever yet
Have stood to charity and displayd the effects
Of disposition gentle and of wisdom
Oertopping womans power Madam you do me wrong
I have no spleen against you nor injustice
For you or any how far I have proceeded
Or how far further shall is warranted
By a commission from the consistory
Yea the whole consistory of Rome You charge me
That I have blown this coal I do deny it
The king is present if it be known to him
That I gainsay my deed how may he wound
And worthily my falsehood yea as much
As you have done my truth If he know
That I am free of your report he knows
I am not of your wrong Therefore in him
It lies to cure me and the cure is to
Remove these thoughts from you the which before
His highness shall speak in I do beseech
You gracious madam to unthink your speaking
And to say so no more
My lord my lord
I am a simple woman much too weak
To oppose your cunning Youre meek and
humblemouthd
You sign your place and calling in full seeming
With meekness and humility but your heart
Is crammd with arrogancy spleen and pride
You have by fortune and his highness favours
Gone slightly oer low steps and now are mounted
Where powers are your retainers and your words
Domestics to you serve your will ast please
Yourself pronounce their office I must tell you
You tender more your persons honour than
Your high profession spiritual that again
I do refuse you for my judge and here
Before you all appeal unto the pope
To bring my whole cause fore his holiness
And to be judged by him
She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII and offers to depart
The queen is obstinate
Stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and
Disdainful to be tried byt tis not well
Shes going away
Call her again
Katharine Queen of England come into the court
Madam you are calld back
What need you note it pray you keep your way
When you are calld return Now the Lord help
They vex me past my patience Pray you pass on
I will not tarry no nor ever more
Upon this business my appearance make
In any of their courts
Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her Attendants
Go thy ways Kate
That man i the world who shall report he has
A better wife let him in nought be trusted
For speaking false in that thou art alone
If thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
Thy meekness saintlike wifelike government
Obeying in commanding and thy parts
Sovereign and pious else could speak thee out
The queen of earthly queens shes noble born
And like her true nobility she has
Carried herself towards me
Most gracious sir
In humblest manner I require your highness
That it shall please you to declare in hearing
Of all these earsfor where I am robbd and bound
There must I be unloosed although not there
At once and fully satisfiedwhether ever I
Did broach this business to your highness or
Laid any scruple in your way which might
Induce you to the question ont or ever
Have to you but with thanks to God for such
A royal lady spake one the least word that might
Be to the prejudice of her present state
Or touch of her good person
My lord cardinal
I do excuse you yea upon mine honour
I free you fromt You are not to be taught
That you have many enemies that know not
Why they are so but like to villagecurs
Bark when their fellows do by some of these
The queen is put in anger Youre excused
But will you be more justified You ever
Have wishd the sleeping of this business never desired
It to be stirrd but oft have hinderd oft
The passages made toward it on my honour
I speak my good lord cardinal to this point
And thus far clear him Now what moved me tot
I will be bold with time and your attention
Then mark the inducement Thus it came give heed tot
My conscience first received a tenderness
Scruple and prick on certain speeches utterd
By the Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador
Who had been hither sent on the debating
A marriage twixt the Duke of Orleans and
Our daughter Mary i the progress of this business
Ere a determinate resolution he
I mean the bishop did require a respite
Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
Whether our daughter were legitimate
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager
Sometimes our brothers wife This respite shook
The bosom of my conscience enterd me
Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
The region of my breast which forced such way
That many mazed considerings did throng
And pressd in with this caution First methought
I stood not in the smile of heaven who had
Commanded nature that my ladys womb
If it conceived a male child by me should
Do no more offices of life tot than
The grave does to the dead for her male issue
Or died where they were made or shortly after
This world had aird them hence I took a thought
This was a judgment on me that my kingdom
Well worthy the best heir o the world should not
Be gladded int by me then follows that
I weighd the danger which my realms stood in
By this my issues fail and that gave to me
Many a groaning throe Thus hulling in
The wild sea of my conscience I did steer
Toward this remedy whereupon we are
Now present here together thats to say
I meant to rectify my consciencewhich
I then did feel full sick and yet not well
By all the reverend fathers of the land
And doctors learnd first I began in private
With you my Lord of Lincoln you remember
How under my oppression I did reek
When I first moved you
Very well my liege
I have spoke long be pleased yourself to say
How far you satisfied me
So please your highness
The question did at first so stagger me
Bearing a state of mighty moment int
And consequence of dread that I committed
The daringst counsel which I had to doubt
And did entreat your highness to this course
Which you are running here
I then moved you
My Lord of Canterbury and got your leave
To make this present summons unsolicited
I left no reverend person in this court
But by particular consent proceeded
Under your hands and seals therefore go on
For no dislike i the world against the person
Of the good queen but the sharp thorny points
Of my alleged reasons drive this forward
Prove but our marriage lawful by my life
And kingly dignity we are contented
To wear our mortal state to come with her
Katharine our queen before the primest creature
Thats paragond o the world
So please your highness
The queen being absent tis a needful fitness
That we adjourn this court till further day
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Made to the queen to call back her appeal
She intends unto his holiness
AsideI may perceive
These cardinals trifle with me I abhor
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome
My learnd and wellbeloved servant Cranmer
Prithee return with thy approach I know
My comfort comes along Break up the court
I say set on
Exeunt in manner as they entered
Enter QUEEN KATHARINE and her Women as at work
Take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles
Sing and disperse em if thou canst leave working
SONG
Orpheus with his lute made trees
And the mountain tops that freeze
Bow themselves when he did sing
To his music plants and flowers
Ever sprung as sun and showers
There had made a lasting spring
Every thing that heard him play
Even the billows of the sea
Hung their heads and then lay by
In sweet music is such art
Killing care and grief of heart
Fall asleep or hearing die
Enter a Gentleman
How now
Ant please your grace the two great cardinals
Wait in the presence
Would they speak with me
They willd me say so madam
Pray their graces
To come near
Exit Gentleman
What can be their business
With me a poor weak woman falln from favour
I do not like their coming Now I think ont
They should be good men their affairs as righteous
But all hoods make not monks
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
Peace to your highness
Your graces find me here part of a housewife
I would be all against the worst may happen
What are your pleasures with me reverend lords
May it please you noble madam to withdraw
Into your private chamber we shall give you
The full cause of our coming
Speak it here
Theres nothing I have done yet o my conscience
Deserves a corner would all other women
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do
My lords I care not so much I am happy
Were tried by every tongue every eye saw em
Envy and base opinion set against em
I know my life so even If your business
Seek me out and that way I am wife in
Out with it boldly truth loves open dealing
Tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina
serenissima
O good my lord no Latin
I am not such a truant since my coming
As not to know the language I have lived in
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange
suspicious
Pray speak in English here are some will thank you
If you speak truth for their poor mistress sake
Believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal
The willingst sin I ever yet committed
May be absolved in English
Noble lady
I am sorry my integrity should breed
And service to his majesty and you
So deep suspicion where all faith was meant
We come not by the way of accusation
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow
You have too much good lady but to know
How you stand minded in the weighty difference
Between the king and you and to deliver
Like free and honest men our just opinions
And comforts to your cause
Most honourd madam
My Lord of York out of his noble nature
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace
Forgetting like a good man your late censure
Both of his truth and him which was too far
Offers as I do in a sign of peace
His service and his counsel
AsideTo betray me
My lords I thank you both for your good wills
Ye speak like honest men pray God ye prove so
But how to make ye suddenly an answer
In such a point of weight so near mine honour
More near my life I fearwith my weak wit
And to such men of gravity and learning
In truth I know not I was set at work
Among my maids full little God knows looking
Either for such men or such business
For her sake that I have beenfor I feel
The last fit of my greatnessgood your graces
Let me have time and counsel for my cause
Alas I am a woman friendless hopeless
Madam you wrong the kings love with these fears
Your hopes and friends are infinite
In England
But little for my profit can you think lords
That any Englishman dare give me counsel
Or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest
And live a subject Nay forsooth my friends
They that must weigh out my afflictions
They that my trust must grow to live not here
They are as all my other comforts far hence
In mine own country lords
I would your grace
Would leave your griefs and take my counsel
How sir
Put your main cause into the kings protection
Hes loving and most gracious twill be much
Both for your honour better and your cause
For if the trial of the law oertake ye
Youll part away disgraced
He tells you rightly
Ye tell me what ye wish for bothmy ruin
Is this your Christian counsel out upon ye
Heaven is above all yet there sits a judge
That no king can corrupt
Your rage mistakes us
The more shame for ye holy men I thought ye
Upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye
Mend em for shame my lords Is this your comfort
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
A woman lost among ye laughd at scornd
I will not wish ye half my miseries
I have more charity but say I warnd ye
Take heed for heavens sake take heed lest at once
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye
You turn the good we offer into envy
Ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye
And all such false professors would you have me
If you have any justice any pity
If ye be any thing but churchmens habits
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
Alas has banishd me his bed already
His love too long ago I am old my lords
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Is only my obedience What can happen
To me above this wretchedness all your studies
Make me a curse like this
Your fears are worse
Have I lived thus longlet me speak myself
Since virtue finds no friendsa wife a true one
A woman I dare say without vainglory
Never yet branded with suspicion
Have I with all my full affections
Still met the king loved him next heaven
obeyd him
Been out of fondness superstitious to him
Almost forgot my prayers to content him
And am I thus rewarded tis not well lords
Bring me a constant woman to her husband
One that neer dreamd a joy beyond his pleasure
And to that woman when she has done most
Yet will I add an honour a great patience
Madam you wander from the good we aim at
My lord I dare not make myself so guilty
To give up willingly that noble title
Your master wed me to nothing but death
Shall eer divorce my dignities
Pray hear me
Would I had never trod this English earth
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
Ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts
What will become of me now wretched lady
I am the most unhappy woman living
Alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes
Shipwreckd upon a kingdom where no pity
No friend no hope no kindred weep for me
Almost no grave allowd me like the lily
That once was mistress of the field and flourishd
Ill hang my head and perish
If your grace
Could but be brought to know our ends are honest
Yould feel more comfort why should we good lady
Upon what cause wrong you alas our places
The way of our profession is against it
We are to cure such sorrows not to sow em
For goodness sake consider what you do
How you may hurt yourself ay utterly
Grow from the kings acquaintance by this carriage
The hearts of princes kiss obedience
So much they love it but to stubborn spirits
They swell and grow as terrible as storms
I know you have a gentle noble temper
A soul as even as a calm pray think us
Those we profess peacemakers friends and servants
Madam youll find it so You wrong your virtues
With these weak womens fears a noble spirit
As yours was put into you ever casts
Such doubts as false coin from it The king loves you
Beware you lose it not for us if you please
To trust us in your business we are ready
To use our utmost  studies in your service
Do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me
If I have used myself unmannerly
You know I am a woman lacking wit
To make a seemly answer to such persons
Pray do my service to his majesty
He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
While I shall have my life Come reverend fathers
Bestow your counsels on me she now begs
That little thought when she set footing here
She should have bought her dignities so dear
Exeunt
Enter NORFOLK SUFFOLK SURREY and Chamberlain
If you will now unite in your complaints
And force them with a constancy the cardinal
Cannot stand under them if you omit
The offer of this time I cannot promise
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces
With these you bear already
I am joyful
To meet the least occasion that may give me
Remembrance of my fatherinlaw the duke
To be revenged on him
Which of the peers
Have uncontemnd gone by him or at least
Strangely neglected when did he regard
The stamp of nobleness in any person
Out of himself
My lords you speak your pleasures
What he deserves of you and me I know
What we can do to him though now the time
Gives way to us I much fear If you cannot
Bar his access to the king never attempt
Any thing on him for he hath a witchcraft
Over the king ins tongue
O fear him not
His spell in that is out the king hath found
Matter against him that for ever mars
The honey of his language No hes settled
Not to come off in his displeasure
Sir
I should be glad to hear such news as this
Once every hour
Believe it this is true
In the divorce his contrary proceedings
Are all unfolded wherein he appears
As I would wish mine enemy
How came
Most strangely
O how how
The cardinals letters to the pope miscarried
And came to the eye o the king wherein was read
How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
To stay the judgment o the divorce for if
It did take place I do quoth he perceive
My king is tangled in affection to
A creature of the queens Lady Anne Bullen
Has the king this
Believe it
Will this work
The king in this perceives him how he coasts
And hedges his own way But in this point
All his tricks founder and he brings his physic
After his patients death the king already
Hath married the fair lady
Would he had
May you be happy in your wish my lord
For I profess you have it
Now all my joy
Trace the conjunction
My amen tot
All mens
Theres order given for her coronation
Marry this is yet but young and may be left
To some ears unrecounted But my lords
She is a gallant creature and complete
In mind and feature I persuade me from her
Will fall some blessing to this land which shall
In it be memorised
But will the king
Digest this letter of the cardinals
The Lord forbid
Marry amen
No no
There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
Will make this sting the sooner Cardinal Campeius
Is stoln away to Rome hath taen no leave
Has left the cause o the king unhandled and
Is posted as the agent of our cardinal
To second all his plot I do assure you
The king cried Ha at this
Now God incense him
And let him cry Ha louder
But my lord
When returns Cranmer
He is returnd in his opinions which
Have satisfied the king for his divorce
Together with all famous colleges
Almost in Christendom shortly I believe
His second marriage shall be publishd and
Her coronation Katharine no more
Shall be calld queen but princess dowager
And widow to Prince Arthur
This same Cranmers
A worthy fellow and hath taen much pain
In the kings business
He has and we shall see him
For it an archbishop
So I hear
Tis so
The cardinal
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL
Observe observe hes moody
The packet Cromwell
Gavet you the king
To his own hand ins bedchamber
Lookd he o the inside of the paper
Presently
He did unseal them and the first he viewd
He did it with a serious mind a heed
Was in his countenance You he bade
Attend him here this morning
Is he ready
To come abroad
I think by this he is
Leave me awhile
Exit CROMWELL
Aside
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon
The French kings sister he shall marry her
Anne Bullen No Ill no Anne Bullens for him
Theres more int than fair visage Bullen
No well no Bullens Speedily I wish
To hear from Rome The Marchioness of Pembroke
Hes discontented
May be he hears the king
Does whet his anger to him
Sharp enough
Lord for thy justice
Aside  The late queens gentlewoman
a knights daughter
To be her mistress mistress the queens queen
This candle burns not clear tis I must snuff it
Then out it goes What though I know her virtuous
And well deserving yet I know her for
A spleeny Lutheran and not wholesome to
Our cause that she should lie i the bosom of
Our hardruled king Again there is sprung up
An heretic an arch one Cranmer one
Hath crawld into the favour of the king
And is his oracle
He is vexd at something
I would twere something that would fret the string
The mastercord ons heart
Enter KING HENRY VIII reading of a schedule and LOVELL
The king the king
What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
To his own portion and what expense by the hour
Seems to flow from him How i the name of thrift
Does he rake this together Now my lords
Saw you the cardinal
My lord we have
Stood here observing him some strange commotion
Is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
Stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
Then lays his finger on his temple straight
Springs out into fast gait then stops again
Strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
His eye against the moon in most strange postures
We have seen him set himself
It may well be
There is a mutiny ins mind This morning
Papers of state he sent me to peruse
As I required and wot you what I found
Thereon my conscience put unwittingly
Forsooth an inventory thus importing
The several parcels of his plate his treasure
Rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
Possession of a subject
Its heavens will
Some spirit put this paper in the packet
To bless your eye withal
If we did think
His contemplation were above the earth
And fixd on spiritual object he should still
Dwell in his musings but I am afraid
His thinkings are below the moon not worth
His serious considering
King HENRY VIII takes his seat whispers LOVELL who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY
Heaven forgive me
Ever God bless your highness
Good my lord
You are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
Of your best graces in your mind the which
You were now running oer you have scarce time
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
To keep your earthly audit sure in that
I deem you an ill husband and am glad
To have you therein my companion
Sir
For holy offices I have a time a time
To think upon the part of business which
I bear i the state and nature does require
Her times of preservation which perforce
I her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
Must give my tendence to
You have said well
And ever may your highness yoke together
As I will lend you cause my doing well
With my well saying
Tis well said again
And tis a kind of good deed to say well
And yet words are no deeds My father loved you
His said he did and with his deed did crown
His word upon you Since I had my office
I have kept you next my heart have not alone
Employd you where high profits might come home
But pared my present havings to bestow
My bounties upon you
Aside             What should this mean
Aside  The Lord increase this business
Have I not made you
The prime man of the state I pray you tell me
If what I now pronounce you have found true
And if you may confess it say withal
If you are bound to us or no What say you
My sovereign I confess your royal graces
Showerd on me daily have been more than could
My studied purposes requite which went
Beyond all mans endeavours my endeavours
Have ever come too short of my desires
Yet filed with my abilities mine own ends
Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
To the good of your most sacred person and
The profit of the state For your great graces
Heapd upon me poor undeserver I
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks
My prayers to heaven for you my loyalty
Which ever has and ever shall be growing
Till death that winter kill it
Fairly answerd
A loyal and obedient subject is
Therein illustrated the honour of it
The foulness is the punishment I presume
That as my hand has opend bounty to you
My heart droppd love my power raind honour more
On you than any so your hand and heart
Your brain and every function of your power
Should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
As twere in loves particular be more
To me your friend than any
I do profess
That for your highness good I ever labourd
More than mine own that am have and will be
Though all the world should crack their duty to you
And throw it from their soul though perils did
Abound as thick as thought could make em and
Appear in forms more horridyet my duty
As doth a rock against the chiding flood
Should the approach of this wild river break
And stand unshaken yours
Tis nobly spoken
Take notice lords he has a loyal breast
For you have seen him opent Read oer this
Giving him papers
And after this and then to breakfast with
What appetite you have
Exit KING HENRY VIII frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY the Nobles throng after him smiling and whispering
What should this mean
What sudden angers this how have I reapd it
He parted frowning from me as if ruin
Leapd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
Upon the daring huntsman that has galld him
Then makes him nothing I must read this paper
I fear the story of his anger Tis so
This paper has undone me tis the account
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
For mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
And fee my friends in Rome O negligence
Fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil
Made me put this main secret in the packet
I sent the king Is there no way to cure this
No new device to beat this from his brains
I know twill stir him strongly yet I know
A way if it take right in spite of fortune
Will bring me off again Whats this To the Pope
The letter as I live with all the business
I writ tos holiness Nay then farewell
I have touchd the highest point of all my greatness
And from that full meridian of my glory
I haste now to my setting I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation m the evening
And no man see me more
Reenter to CARDINAL WOLSEY NORFOLK and SUFFOLK SURREY and the Chamberlain
Hear the kings pleasure cardinal who commands you
To render up the great seal presently
Into our hands and to confine yourself
To Asher House my Lord of Winchesters
Till you hear further from his highness
Stay
Wheres your commission lords words cannot carry
Authority so weighty
Who dare cross em
Bearing the kings will from his mouth expressly
Till I find more than will or words to do it
I mean your malice know officious lords
I dare and must deny it Now I feel
Of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces
As if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
Follow your envious courses men of malice
You have Christian warrant for em and no doubt
In time will find their fit rewards That seal
You ask with such a violence the king
Mine and your master with his own hand gave me
Bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
During my life and to confirm his goodness
Tied it by letterspatents now wholl take it
The king that gave it
It must be himself then
Thou art a proud traitor priest
Proud lord thou liest
Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Have burnt that tongue than said so
Thy ambition
Thou scarlet sin robbd this bewailing land
Of noble Buckingham my fatherinlaw
The heads of all thy brother cardinals
With thee and all thy best parts bound together
Weighd not a hair of his Plague of your policy
You sent me deputy for Ireland
Far from his succor from the king from all
That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him
Whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
Absolved him with an axe
This and all else
This talking lord can lay upon my credit
I answer is most false The duke by law
Found his deserts how innocent I was
From any private malice in his end
His noble jury and foul cause can witness
If I loved many words lord I should tell you
You have as little honesty as honour
That in the way of loyalty and truth
Toward the king my ever royal master
Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be
And all that love his follies
By my soul
Your long coat priest protects you thou
shouldst feel
My sword i the lifeblood of thee else My lords
Can ye endure to hear this arrogance
And from this fellow if we live thus tamely
To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
Farewell nobility let his grace go forward
And dare us with his cap like larks
All goodness
Is poison to thy stomach
Yes that goodness
Of gleaning all the lands wealth into one
Into your own hands cardinal by extortion
The goodness of your intercepted packets
You writ to the pope against the king your goodness
Since you provoke me shall be most notorious
My Lord of Norfolk as you are truly noble
As you respect the common good the state
Of our despised nobility our issues
Who if he live will scarce be gentlemen
Produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
Collected from his life Ill startle you
Worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench
Lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal
How much methinks I could despise this man
But that I am bound in charity against it
Those articles my lord are in the kings hand
But thus much they are foul ones
So much fairer
And spotless shall mine innocence arise
When the king knows my truth
This cannot save you
I thank my memory I yet remember
Some of these articles and out they shall
Now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal
Youll show a little honesty
Speak on sir
I dare your worst objections if I blush
It is to see a nobleman want manners
I had rather want those than my head Have at you
First that without the kings assent or knowledge
You wrought to be a legate by which power
You maimd the jurisdiction of all bishops
Then that in all you writ to Rome or else
To foreign princes Ego et Rex meus
Was still inscribed in which you brought the king
To be your servant
Then that without the knowledge
Either of king or council when you went
Ambassador to the emperor you made bold
To carry into Flanders the great seal
Item you sent a large commission
To Gregory de Cassado to conclude
Without the kings will or the states allowance
A league between his highness and Ferrara
That out of mere ambition you have caused
Your holy hat to be stampd on the kings coin
Then that you have sent innumerable substance
By what means got I leave to your own conscience
To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
You have for dignities to the mere undoing
Of all the kingdom Many more there are
Which since they are of you and odious
I will not taint my mouth with
O my lord
Press not a falling man too far tis virtue
His faults lie open to the laws let them
Not you correct him My heart weeps to see him
So little of his great self
I forgive him
Lord cardinal the kings further pleasure is
Because all those things you have done of late
By your power legatine within this kingdom
Fall into the compass of a praemunire
That therefore such a writ be sued against you
To forfeit all your goods lands tenements
Chattels and whatsoever and to be
Out of the kings protection This is my charge
And so well leave you to your meditations
How to live better For your stubborn answer
About the giving back the great seal to us
The king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
So fare you well my little good lord cardinal
Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY
So farewell to the little good you bear me
Farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
This is the state of man today he puts forth
The tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him
The third day comes a frost a killing frost
And when he thinks good easy man full surely
His greatness is aripening nips his root
And then he falls as I do I have ventured
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
This many summers in a sea of glory
But far beyond my depth my highblown pride
At length broke under me and now has left me
Weary and old with service to the mercy
Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye
I feel my heart new opend O how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on princes favours
There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
More pangs and fears than wars or women have
And when he falls he falls like Lucifer
Never to hope again
Enter CROMWELL and stands amazed
Why how now Cromwell
I have no power to speak sir
What amazed
At my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder
A great man should decline Nay an you weep
I am falln indeed
How does your grace
Why well
Never so truly happy my good Cromwell
I know myself now and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly dignities
A still and quiet conscience The king has cured me
I humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders
These ruind pillars out of pity taken
A load would sink a navy too much honour
O tis a burthen Cromwell tis a burthen
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it
I hope I have I am able now methinks
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel
To endure more miseries and greater far
Than my weakhearted enemies dare offer
What news abroad
The heaviest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the king
God bless him
The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord chancellor in your place
Thats somewhat sudden
But hes a learned man May he continue
Long in his highness favour and do justice
For truths sake and his conscience that his bones
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
May have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em What more
That Cranmer is returnd with welcome
Installd lord archbishop of Canterbury
Thats news indeed
Last that the Lady Anne
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married
This day was viewd in open as his queen
Going to chapel and the voice is now
Only about her coronation
There was the weight that pulld me down O Cromwell
The king has gone beyond me all my glories
In that one woman I have lost for ever
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell
I am a poor falln man unworthy now
To be thy lord and master seek the king
That sun I pray may never set I have told him
What and how true thou art he will advance thee
Some little memory of me will stir him
I know his noble naturenot to let
Thy hopeful service perish too good Cromwell
Neglect him not make use now and provide
For thine own future safety
O my lord
Must I then leave you must I needs forego
So good so noble and so true a master
Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord
The king shall have my service but my prayers
For ever and for ever shall be yours
Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries but thou hast forced me
Out of thy honest truth to play the woman
Lets dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell
And when I am forgotten as I shall be
And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee
Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in
A sure and safe one though thy master missd it
Mark but my fall and that that ruind me
Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition
By that sin fell the angels how can man then
The image of his Maker hope to win by it
Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee
Corruption wins not more than honesty
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not
Let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys
Thy Gods and truths then if thou fallst
O Cromwell
Thou fallst a blessed martyr Serve the king
Andprithee lead me in
There take an inventory of all I have
To the last penny tis the kings my robe
And my integrity to heaven is all
I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell
Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king he would not in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies
Good sir have patience
So I have Farewell
The hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell
Exeunt
Enter two Gentlemen meeting one another
Youre well met once again
So are you
You come to take your stand here and behold
The Lady Anne pass from her coronation
Tis all my business At our last encounter
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial
Tis very true but that time offerd sorrow
This general joy
Tis well the citizens
I am sure have shown at full their royal minds
As let em have their rights they are ever forward
In celebration of this day with shows
Pageants and sights of honour
Never greater
Nor Ill assure you better taken sir
May I be bold to ask at what that contains
That paper in your hand
Yes tis the list
Of those that claim their offices this day
By custom of the coronation
The Duke of Suffolk is the first and claims
To be highsteward next the Duke of Norfolk
He to be earl marshal you may read the rest
I thank you sir had I not known those customs
I should have been beholding to your paper
But I beseech you whats become of Katharine
The princess dowager how goes her business
That I can tell you too The Archbishop
Of Canterbury accompanied with other
Learned and reverend fathers of his order
Held a late court at Dunstable six miles off
From Ampthill where the princess lay to which
She was often cited by them but appeard not
And to be short for not appearance and
The kings late scruple by the main assent
Of all these learned men she was divorced
And the late marriage made of none effect
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton
Where she remains now sick
Alas good lady
Trumpets
The trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming
Hautboys
THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION
1 A lively flourish of Trumpets
2 Then two Judges
3 Lord Chancellor with the purse and mace
before him
4 Choristers singing
Music
5 Mayor of London bearing the mace Then
Garter in his coat of arms and on his
head a gilt copper crown
6 Marquess Dorset bearing a sceptre of gold
on his head a demicoronal of gold With
him SURREY bearing the rod of silver with
the dove crowned with an earls coronet
Collars of SS
7 SUFFOLK in his robe of estate his coronet

Collars of SS
8 A canopy borne by four of the Cinqueports
under it QUEEN ANNE in her robe in her hair
richly adorned with pearl crowned On each
side her the Bishops of London and
Winchester
9 The old Duchess of Norfolk in a coronal of
gold wrought with flowers bearing QUEEN
ANNEs train
10 Certain Ladies or Countesses with plain
circlets of gold without flowers
They pass over the stage in order and state
A royal train believe me These I know
Whos that that bears the sceptre
Marquess Dorset
And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod
A bold brave gentleman That should be
The Duke of Suffolk
Tis the same highsteward
And that my Lord of Norfolk
Yes
Heaven bless thee
Looking on QUEEN ANNE
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever lookd on
Sir as I have a soul she is an angel
Our king has all the Indies in his arms
And more and richer when he strains that lady
I cannot blame his conscience
They that bear
The cloth of honour over her are four barons
Of the Cinqueports
Those men are happy and so are all are near her
I take it she that carries up the train
Is that old noble lady Duchess of Norfolk
It is and all the rest are countesses
Their coronets say so These are stars indeed
And sometimes falling ones
No more of that
Exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets
Enter a third Gentleman
God save you sir where have you been broiling
Among the crowd i the Abbey where a finger
Could not be wedged in more I am stifled
With the mere rankness of their joy
You saw
The ceremony
That I did
How was it
Well worth the seeing
Good sir speak it to us
As well as I am able The rich stream
Of lords and ladies having brought the queen
To a prepared place in the choir fell off
A distance from her while her grace sat down
To rest awhile some half an hour or so
In a rich chair of state opposing freely
The beauty of her person to the people
Believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
That ever lay by man which when the people
Had the full view of such a noise arose
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
As loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks
Doublets I thinkflew up and had their faces
Been loose this day they had been lost Such joy
I never saw before Greatbellied women
That had not half a week to go like rams
In the old time of war would shake the press
And make em reel before em No man living
Could say This is my wife there all were woven
So strangely in one piece
But what followd
At length her grace rose and with modest paces
Came to the altar where she kneeld and saintlike
Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayd devoutly
Then rose again and bowd her to the people
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
She had all the royal makings of a queen
As holy oil Edward Confessors crown
The rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
Laid nobly on her which performd the choir
With all the choicest music of the kingdom
Together sung Te Deum So she parted
And with the same full state paced back again
To Yorkplace where the feast is held
Sir
You must no more call it Yorkplace thats past
For since the cardinal fell that titles lost
Tis now the kings and calld Whitehall
I know it
But tis so lately alterd that the old name
Is fresh about me
What two reverend bishops
Were those that went on each side of the queen
Stokesly and Gardiner the one of Winchester
Newly preferrd from the kings secretary
The other London
He of Winchester
Is held no great good lover of the archbishops
The virtuous Cranmer
All the land knows that
However yet there is no great breach when it comes
Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him
Who may that be I pray you
Thomas Cromwell
A man in much esteem with the king and truly
A worthy friend The king has made him master
O the jewel house
And one already of the privy council
He will deserve more
Yes without all doubt
Come gentlemen ye shall go my way which
Is to the court and there ye shall be my guests
Something I can command As I walk thither
Ill tell ye more
You may command us sir
Exeunt
Enter KATHARINE Dowager sick led between GRIFFITH her gentleman usher and PATIENCE her woman
How does your grace
O Griffith sick to death
My legs like loaden branches bow to the earth
Willing to leave their burthen Reach a chair
So now methinks I feel a little ease
Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou ledst me
That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey Was dead
Yes madam but I think your grace
Out of the pain you sufferd gave no ear tot
Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died
If well he steppd before me happily
For my example
Well the voice goes madam
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York and brought him forward
As a man sorely tainted to his answer
He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
He could not sit his mule
Alas poor man
At last with easy roads he came to Leicester
Lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot
With all his covent honourably received him
To whom he gave these words O father abbot
An old man broken with the storms of state
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye
Give him a little earth for charity
So went to bed where eagerly his sickness
Pursued him still and three nights after this
About the hour of eight which he himself
Foretold should be his last full of repentance
Continual meditations tears and sorrows
He gave his honours to the world again
His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
So may he rest his faults lie gently on him
Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him
And yet with charity He was a man
Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
Himself with princes one that by suggestion
Tied all the kingdom simony was fairplay
His own opinion was his law i the presence
He would say untruths and be ever double
Both in his words and meaning he was never
But where he meant to ruin pitiful
His promises were as he then was mighty
But his performance as he is now nothing
Of his own body he was ill and gave
The clergy in example
Noble madam
Mens evil manners live in brass their virtues
We write in water May it please your highness
To hear me speak his good now
Yes good Griffith
I were malicious else
This cardinal
Though from an humble stock undoubtedly
Was fashiond to much honour from his cradle
He was a scholar and a ripe and good one
Exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer
And though he were unsatisfied in getting
Which was a sin yet in bestowing madam
He was most princely ever witness for him
Those twins Of learning that he raised in you
Ipswich and Oxford one of which fell with him
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it
The other though unfinishd yet so famous
So excellent in art and still so rising
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue
His overthrow heapd happiness upon him
For then and not till then he felt himself
And found the blessedness of being little
And to add greater honours to his age
Than man could give him he died fearing God
After my death I wish no other herald
To keep mine honour from corruption
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith
Whom I most hated living thou hast made me
With thy religious truth and modesty
Now in his ashes honour peace be with him
Patience be near me still and set me lower
I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith
Cause the musicians play me that sad note
I named my knell whilst I sit meditating
On that celestial harmony I go to
Sad and solemn music
She is asleep good wench lets sit down quiet
For fear we wake her softly gentle Patience
The vision Enter solemnly tripping one after  another six personages clad in white robes  wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden  vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in  their hands They first congee unto her then  dance and at certain changes the first two hold  a spare garland over her head at which the other  four make reverent curtsies then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two  who observe the same order in their changes and  holding the garland over her head which done  they deliver the same garland to the last two who  likewise observe the same order at which as it  were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven  and so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them The music continues
Spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye
Madam we are here
It is not you I call for
Saw ye none enter since I slept
None madam
No Saw you not even now a blessed troop
Invite me to a banquet whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
They promised me eternal happiness
And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel
I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly
I am most joyful madam such good dreams
Possess your fancy
Bid the music leave
They are harsh and heavy to me
Music ceases
Do you note
How much her grace is alterd on the sudden
How long her face is drawn how pale she looks
And of an earthy cold Mark her eyes
She is going wench pray pray
Heaven comfort her
Enter a Messenger
Ant like your grace
You are a saucy fellow
Deserve we no more reverence
You are to blame
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness
To use so rude behavior go to kneel
I humbly do entreat your highness pardon
My haste made me unmannerly There is staying
A gentleman sent from the king to see you
Admit him entrance Griffith but this fellow
Let me neer see again
Exeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger
Reenter GRIFFITH with CAPUCIUS
If my sight fail not
You should be lord ambassador from the emperor
My royal nephew and your name Capucius

O my lord
The times and titles now are alterd strangely
With me since first you knew me But I pray you
What is your pleasure with me
Noble lady
First mine own service to your grace the next
The kings request that I would visit you
Who grieves much for your weakness and by me
Sends you his princely commendations
And heartily entreats you take good comfort
O my good lord that comfort comes too late
Tis like a pardon after execution
That gentle physic given in time had cured me
But now I am past an comforts here but prayers
How does his highness
Madam in good health
So may he ever do and ever flourish
When I shal l dwell with worms and my poor name
Banishd the kingdom Patience is that letter
I caused you write yet sent away
No madam
Giving it to KATHARINE
Sir I most humbly pray you to deliver
This to my lord the king
Most willing madam
In which I have commended to his goodness
The model of our chaste loves his young daughter
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding
She is young and of a noble modest nature
I hope she will deserve welland a little
To love her for her mothers sake that loved him
Heaven knows how dearly My next poor petition
Is that his noble grace would have some pity
Upon my wretched women that so long
Have followd both my fortunes faithfully
Of which there is not one I dare avow
And now I should not lie but will deserve
For virtue and true beauty of the soul
For honesty and decent carriage
A right good husband let him be a noble
And sure those men are happy that shall have em
The last is for my men they are the poorest
But poverty could never draw em from me
That they may have their wages duly paid em
And something over to remember me by
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
And able means we had not parted thus
These are the whole contents and good my lord
By that you love the dearest in this world
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed
Stand these poor peoples friend and urge the king
To do me this last right
By heaven I will
Or let me lose the fashion of a man
I thank you honest lord Remember me
In all humility unto his highness
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world tell him in death I blessd him
For so I will Mine eyes grow dim Farewell
My lord Griffith farewell Nay Patience
You must not leave me yet I must to bed
Call in more women When I am dead good wench
Let me be used with honour strew me over
With maiden flowers that all the world may know
I was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me
Then lay me forth although unqueend yet like
A queen and daughter to a king inter me
I can no more
Exeunt leading KATHARINE
Enter GARDINER Bishop of Winchester a Page with a torch before him met by LOVELL

Not yet Sir Thomas Lovell Whats the matter

No great offence belongs tot give your friend
Some touch of your late business affairs that walk
As they say spirits do at midnight have
In them a wilder nature than the business
That seeks dispatch by day
My lord I love you
And durst commend a secret to your ear
Much weightier than this work The queens in labour
They say in great extremity and feard
Shell with the labour end
The fruit she goes with

Good time and live but for the stock Sir Thomas
I wish it grubbd up now
Methinks I could
Cry the amen and yet my conscience says
Shes a good creature and sweet lady does

With which the time will load him The archbishop
Is the kings hand and tongue and who dare speak
One syllable against him
Yes yes Sir Thomas
There are that dare and I myself have ventured
To speak my mind of him and indeed this day
Sir I may tell it you I think I have
Incensed the lords o the council that he is
For so I know he is they know he is
A most arch heretic a pestilence
That does infect the land with which they moved
Have broken with the king who hath so far
Given ear to our complaint of his great grace
And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
Our reasons laid before him hath commanded
Tomorrow morning to the councilboard
He be convented Hes a rank weed Sir Thomas
And we must root him out From your affairs

What you commanded me but by her woman
I sent your message who returnd her thanks
In the greatst humbleness and desired your highness
Most heartily to pray for her
What sayst thou ha
To pray for her what is she crying out
So said her woman and that her sufferance made
Almost each pang a death
Alas good lady
God safely quit her of her burthen and
With gentle travail to the gladding of
Your highness with an heir

How now my lord you desire to know
Wherefore I sent for you

To attend your highness pleasure
Pray you arise
My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury
Come you and I must walk a turn together

And am right sorry to repeat what follows
I have and most unwillingly of late
Heard many grievous I do say my lord
Grievous complaints of you which being considerd
Have moved us and our council that you shall
This morning come before us where I know
You cannot with such freedom purge yourself
But that till further trial in those charges
Which will require your answer you must take
Your patience to you and be well contented
To make your house our Tower you a brother of us
It fits we thus proceed or else no witness
Would come against you
Kneeling
I humbly thank your highness
And am right glad to catch this good occasion
Most throughly to be winnowd where my chaff
And corn shall fly asunder for I know
Theres none stands under more calumnious tongues
Than I myself poor man
Stand up good Canterbury
Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
In us thy friend give me thy hand stand up
Prithee lets walk Now by my holidame
What manner of man are you My lord I lookd
You would have given me your petition that
I should have taen some pains to bring together
Yourself and your accusers and to have heard you
Without indurance further
Most dread liege
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty
If they shall fail I with mine enemies
Will triumph oer my person which I weigh not
Being of those virtues vacant I fear nothing
What can be said against me
Know you not
How your state stands i the world with the whole world
Must bear the same proportion and not ever
The justice and the truth o the question carries
The due o the verdict with it at what ease
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
To swear against you such things have been done
You are potently opposed and with a malice
Of as great size Ween you of better luck
I mean in perjured witness than your master
Whose minister you are whiles here he lived
Upon this naughty earth Go to go to
You take a precipice for no leap of danger
And woo your own destruction
God and your majesty
Protect mine innocence or I fall into
The trap is laid for me
Be of good cheer
They shall no more prevail than we give way to
Keep comfort to you and this morning see
You do appear before them if they shall chance
In charging you with matters to commit you
The best persuasions to the contrary
Fail not to use and with what vehemency
The occasion shall instruct you if entreaties
Will render you no remedy this ring
Deliver them and your appeal to us
There make before them Look the good man weeps
Hes honest on mine honour Gods blest mother
I swear he is truehearted and a soul
None better in my kingdom Get you gone
And do as I have bid you
Exit CRANMER

Enter Old Lady LOVELL following
Within                 Come back what mean you

I guess thy message Is the queen deliverd
Say ay and of a boy

Lovell

Exeunt

Enter CRANMER
I hope I am not too late and yet the gentleman
That was sent to me from the council prayd me
To make great haste All fast what means this Ho
Who waits there Sure you know me
Enter Keeper
Yes my lord
But yet I cannot help you
Why
Enter DOCTOR BUTTS
Your grace must wait till you be calld for
So
Aside  This is a piece of malice I am glad
I came this way so happily the king
Shall understand it presently
Exit
AsideTis Butts
The kings physician as he passd along
How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me
Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace For certain
This is of purpose laid by some that hate me
God turn their hearts I never sought their malice
To quench mine honour they would shame to make me
Wait else at door a fellowcounsellor
Mong boys grooms and lackeys But their pleasures
Must be fulfilld and I attend with patience
Enter the KING HENRY VIII and DOCTOR BUTTS at a window above
Ill show your grace the strangest sight
Whats that Butts
I think your highness saw this many a day
Body o me where is it
There my lord
The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury
Who holds his state at door mongst pursuivants
Pages and footboys
Ha tis he indeed
Is this the honour they do one another
Tis well theres one above em yet I had thought
They had parted so much honesty among em
At least good manners as not thus to suffer
A man of his place and so near our favour
To dance attendance on their lordships pleasures
And at the door too like a post with packets
By holy Mary Butts theres knavery
Let em alone and draw the curtain close
We shall hear more anon
Exeunt
Enter Chancellor places himself at the upper end  of the table on the left hand a seat being left  void above him as for CRANMERs seat SUFFOLK  NORFOLK SURREY Chamberlain GARDINER seat  themselves in order on each side CROMWELL at lower end as secretary Keeper at the door
Speak to the business mastersecretary
Why are we met in council
Please your honours
The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury
Has he had knowledge of it
Yes
Who waits there
Without my noble lords
Yes
My lord archbishop
And has done half an hour to know your pleasures
Let him come in
Your grace may enter now
CRANMER enters and approaches the counciltable
My good lord archbishop Im very sorry
To sit here at this present and behold
That chair stand empty but we all are men
In our own natures frail and capable
Of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
And want of wisdom you that best should teach us
Have misdemeand yourself and not a little
Toward the king first then his laws in filling
The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
For so we are informd with new opinions
Divers and dangerous which are heresies
And not reformd may prove pernicious
Which reformation must be sudden too
My noble lords for those that tame wild horses
Pace em not in their hands to make em gentle
But stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur em
Till they obey the manage If we suffer
Out of our easiness and childish pity
To one mans honour this contagious sickness
Farewell all physic and what follows then
Commotions uproars with a general taint
Of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
The upper Germany can dearly witness
Yet freshly pitied in our memories
My good lords hitherto in all the progress
Both of my life and office I have labourd
And with no little study that my teaching
And the strong course of my authority
Might go one way and safely and the end
Was ever to do well nor is there living
I speak it with a single heart my lords
A man that more detests more stirs against
Both in his private conscience and his place
Defacers of a public peace than I do
Pray heaven the king may never find a heart
With less allegiance in it Men that make
Envy and crooked malice nourishment
Dare bite the best I do beseech your lordships
That in this case of justice my accusers
Be what they will may stand forth face to face
And freely urge against me
Nay my lord
That cannot be you are a counsellor
And by that virtue no man dare accuse you
My lord because we have business of more moment
We will be short with you Tis his highness pleasure
And our consent for better trial of you
From hence you be committed to the Tower
Where being but a private man again
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly
More than I fear you are provided for
Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thank you
You are always my good friend if your will pass
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror
You are so merciful I see your end
Tis my undoing love and meekness lord
Become a churchman better than ambition
Win straying souls with modesty again
Cast none away That I shall clear myself
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
I make as little doubt as you do conscience
In doing daily wrongs I could say more
But reverence to your calling makes me modest
My lord my lord you are a sectary
Thats the plain truth your painted gloss discovers
To men that understand you words and weakness
My Lord of Winchester you are a little
By your good favour too sharp men so noble
However faulty yet should find respect
For what they have been tis a cruelty
To load a falling man
Good master secretary
I cry your honour mercy you may worst
Of all this table say so
Why my lord
Do not I know you for a favourer
Of this new sect ye are not sound
Not sound
Not sound I say
Would you were half so honest
Mens prayers then would seek you not their fears
I shall remember this bold language
Do
Remember your bold life too
This is too much
Forbear for shame my lords
I have done
And I
Then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
I take it by all voices that forthwith
You be conveyd to the Tower a prisoner
There to remain till the kings further pleasure
Be known unto us are you all agreed lords
We are
Is there no other way of mercy
But I must needs to the Tower my lords
What other
Would you expect you are strangely troublesome
Let some o the guard be ready there
Enter Guard
For me
Must I go like a traitor thither
Receive him
And see him safe i the Tower
Stay good my lords
I have a little yet to say Look there my lords
By virtue of that ring I take my cause
Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
To a most noble judge the king my master
This is the kings ring
Tis no counterfeit
Tis the right ring by heaven I told ye all
When ye first put this dangerous stone arolling
Twould fall upon ourselves
Do you think my lords
The king will suffer but the little finger
Of this man to be vexd
Tis now too certain
How much more is his life in value with him
Would I were fairly out ont
My mind gave me
In seeking tales and informations
Against this man whose honesty the devil
And his disciples only envy at
Ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye
Enter KING frowning on them takes his seat
Dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
In daily thanks that gave us such a prince
Not only good and wise but most religious
One that in all obedience makes the church
The chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
That holy duty out of dear respect
His royal self in judgment comes to hear
The cause betwixt her and this great offender
You were ever good at sudden commendations
Bishop of Winchester But know I come not
To hear such flattery now and in my presence
They are too thin and bare to hide offences
To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me
But whatsoeer thou takest me for Im sure
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
To CRANMER
Good man sit down Now let me see the proudest
He that dares most but wag his finger at thee
By all thats holy he had better starve
Than but once think this place becomes thee not
May it please your grace
No sir it does not please me
I had thought I had had men of some understanding
And wisdom of my council but I find none
Was it discretion lords to let this man
This good manfew of you deserve that title
This honest man wait like a lousy footboy
At chamberdoor and one as great as you are
Why what a shame was this Did my commission
Bid ye so far forget yourselves I gave ye
Power as he was a counsellor to try him
Not as a groom theres some of ye I see
More out of malice than integrity
Would try him to the utmost had ye mean
Which ye shall never have while I live
Thus far
My most dread sovereign may it like your grace
To let my tongue excuse all What was purposed
Concerning his imprisonment was rather
If there be faith in men meant for his trial
And fair purgation to the world than malice
Im sure in me
Well well my lords respect him
Take him and use him well hes worthy of it
I will say thus much for him if a prince
May be beholding to a subject I
Am for his love and service so to him
Make me no more ado but all embrace him
Be friends for shame my lords My Lord of
Canterbury
I have a suit which you must not deny me
That is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
You must be godfather and answer for her
The greatest monarch now alive may glory
In such an honour how may I deserve it
That am a poor and humble subject to you
Come come my lord yould spare your spoons you
shall have two noble partners with you the old
Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquess Dorset will
these please you
Once more my Lord of Winchester I charge you
Embrace and love this man
With a true heart
And brotherlove I do it
And let heaven
Witness how dear I hold this confirmation
Good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
The common voice I see is verified
Of thee which says thus Do my Lord of Canterbury
A shrewd turn and he is your friend for ever
Come lords we trifle time away I long
To have this young one made a Christian
As I have made ye one lords one remain
So I grow stronger you more honour gain
Exeunt
Noise and tumult within Enter Porter and his Man

staves and strong ones these are but switches to

To scatter em as tis to make em sleep

We may as well push against Powles as stir em
How got they in and be hangd
Alas I know not how gets the tide in
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot
You see the poor remaindercould distribute
I made no spare sir
You did nothing sir
I am not Samson nor Sir Guy nor Colbrand
To mow em down before me but if I spared any
That had a head to hit either young or old
He or she cuckold or cuckoldmaker
Let me neer hope to see a chine again
And that I would not for a cow God save her
Within
Do you hear master porter
I shall be with you presently good master puppy
Keep the door close sirrah
What would you have me do
What should you do but knock em down by the
dozens Is this Moorfields to muster in or have

court the women so besiege us Bless me what a
fry of fornication is at door On my Christian
conscience this one christening will beget a
thousand here will be father godfather and all together
The spoons will be the bigger sir There is a
fellow somewhat near the door he should be a
brazier by his face for o my conscience twenty
of the dogdays now reign ins nose all that stand
about him are under the line they need no other
penance that firedrake did I hit three times on
the head and three times was his nose discharged
against me he stands there like a mortarpiece to
blow us There was a haberdashers wife of small
wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked
porringer fell off her head for kindling such a
combustion in the state I missed the meteor once
and hit that woman who cried out Clubs when I
might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
her succor which were the hope o the Strand where
she was quartered They fell on I made good my
place at length they came to the broomstaff to
me I defied em still when suddenly a file of
boys behind em loose shot delivered such a shower
of pebbles that I was fain to draw mine honour in
and let em win the work the devil was amongst
em I think surely
These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse
and fight for bitten apples that no audience but
the tribulation of Towerhill or the limbs of
Limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure
I have some of em in Limbo Patrum and there they
are like to dance these three days besides the
running banquet of two beadles that is to come
Enter Chamberlain
Mercy o me what a multitude are here
They grow still too from all parts they are coming
As if we kept a fair here Where are these porters
These lazy knaves Ye have made a fine hand fellows
Theres a trim rabble let in are all these
Your faithful friends o the suburbs We shall have
Great store of room no doubt left for the ladies
When they pass back from the christening
Ant please
your honour
We are but men and what so many may do
Not being torn apieces we have done
An army cannot rule em
As I live
If the king blame me fort Ill lay ye all
By the heels and suddenly and on your heads
Clap round fines for neglect ye are lazy knaves
And here ye lie baiting of bombards when
Ye should do service Hark the trumpets sound
Theyre come already from the christening
Go break among the press and find a way out
To let the troop pass fairly or Ill find
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months
Make way there for the princess
You great fellow
Stand close up or Ill make your head ache
You i the camlet get up o the rail
Ill peck you oer the pales else

Heaven from thy endless goodness send prosperous
life long and ever happy to the high and mighty
princess of England Elizabeth
Flourish Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard
Kneeling And to your royal grace and the good queen
My noble partners and myself thus pray
All comfort joy in this most gracious lady
Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy
May hourly fall upon ye
Thank you good lord archbishop
What is her name
Elizabeth
Stand up lord
KING HENRY VIII kisses the child
With this kiss take my blessing God protect thee
Into whose hand I give thy life
Amen
My noble gossips ye have been too prodigal
I thank ye heartily so shall this lady
When she has so much English
Let me speak sir
For heaven now bids me and the words I utter
Let none think flattery for theyll find em truth
This royal infantheaven still move about her
Though in her cradle yet now promises
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings
Which time shall bring to ripeness she shall be
But few now living can behold that goodness
A pattern to all princes living with her
And all that shall succeed Saba was never
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Than this pure soul shall be all princely graces
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is
With all the virtues that attend the good
Shall still be doubled on her truth shall nurse her
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her
She shall be loved and feard her own shall bless her
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn
And hang their heads with sorrow good grows with her
In her days every man shall eat in safety
Under his own vine what he plants and sing
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours
God shall be truly known and those about her
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour
And by those claim their greatness not by blood
Nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when
The bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix
Her ashes new create another heir
As great in admiration as herself
So shall she leave her blessedness to one
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was
And so stand fixd peace plenty love truth terror
That were the servants to this chosen infant
Shall then be his and like a vine grow to him
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine
His honour and the greatness of his name
Shall be and make new nations he shall flourish
And like a mountain cedar reach his branches
To all the plains about him our childrens children
Shall see this and bless heaven
Thou speakest wonders
She shall be to the happiness of England
An aged princess many days shall see her
And yet no day without a deed to crown it
Would I had known no more but she must die
She must the saints must have her yet a virgin
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
To the ground and all the world shall mourn her
O lord archbishop
Thou hast made me now a man never before
This happy child did I get any thing
This oracle of comfort has so pleased me
That when I am in heaven I shall desire
To see what this child does and praise my Maker
I thank ye all To you my good lord mayor
And your good brethren I am much beholding
I have received much honour by your presence
And ye shall find me thankful Lead the way lords
Ye must all see the queen and she must thank ye
She will be sick else This day no man think
Has business at his house for all shall stay
This little one shall make it holiday
Exeunt
EPILOGUE
Tis ten to one this play can never please
All that are here some come to take their ease
We have frighted with our trumpets so tis clear
Theyll say tis naught others to hear the city
Abused extremely and to cry Thats witty
Which we have not done neither that I fear
All the expected good were like to hear
For this play at this time is only in
The merciful construction of good women
For such a one we showd em if they smile
And say twill do I know within a while
All the best men are ours for tis ill hap
If they hold when their ladies bid em clap
Enter KING JOHN QUEEN ELINOR PEMBROKE ESSEX SALISBURY and others with CHATILLON
Now say Chatillon what would France with us
Thus after greeting speaks the King of France
In my behavior to the majesty
The borrowd majesty of England here
A strange beginning borrowd majesty
Silence good mother hear the embassy
Philip of France in right and true behalf
Of thy deceased brother Geffreys son
Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim
To this fair island and the territories
To Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Maine
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
Which sways usurpingly these several titles
And put these same into young Arthurs hand
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign
What follows if we disallow of this
The proud control of fierce and bloody war
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld
Here have we war for war and blood for blood
Controlment for controlment so answer France
Then take my kings defiance from my mouth
The farthest limit of my embassy
Bear mine to him and so depart in peace
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France
For ere thou canst report I will be there
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard
So hence Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay
An honourable conduct let him have
Pembroke look to t Farewell Chatillon
Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE
What now my son have I not ever said
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Till she had kindled France and all the world
Upon the right and party of her son
This might have been prevented and made whole
With very easy arguments of love
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate
Our strong possession and our right for us
Your strong possession much more than your right
Or else it must go wrong with you and me
So much my conscience whispers in your ear
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear
Enter a Sheriff
My liege here is the strangest controversy
Come from country to be judged by you
That eer I heard shall I produce the men
Let them approach
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
This expeditions charge
Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD
What men are you
Your faithful subject I a gentleman
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son
As I suppose to Robert Faulconbridge
A soldier by the honourgiving hand
Of Coeurdelion knighted in the field
What art thou
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge
Is that the elder and art thou the heir
You came not of one mother then it seems
Most certain of one mother mighty king
That is well known and as I think one father
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
I put you oer to heaven and to my mother
Of that I doubt as all mens children may
Out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
And wound her honour with this diffidence
I madam no I have no reason for it
That is my brothers plea and none of mine
The which if he can prove a pops me out
At least from fair five hundred pound a year
Heaven guard my mothers honour and my land
A good blunt fellow Why being younger born
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
I know not why except to get the land
But once he slanderd me with bastardy
But whether I be as true begot or no
That still I lay upon my mothers head
But that I am as well begot my liege
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
Compare our faces and be judge yourself
If old sir Robert did beget us both
And were our father and this son like him
O old sir Robert father on my knee
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee
Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
He hath a trick of Coeurdelions face
The accent of his tongue affecteth him
Do you not read some tokens of my son
In the large composition of this man
Mine eye hath well examined his parts
And finds them perfect Richard Sirrah speak
What doth move you to claim your brothers land
Because he hath a halfface like my father
With half that face would he have all my land
A halffaced groat five hundred pound a year
My gracious liege when that my father lived
Your brother did employ my father much
Well sir by this you cannot get my land
Your tale must be how he employd my mother
And once dispatchd him in an embassy
To Germany there with the emperor
To treat of high affairs touching that time
The advantage of his absence took the king
And in the mean time sojournd at my fathers
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak
But truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
Between my father and my mother lay
As I have heard my father speak himself
When this same lusty gentleman was got
Upon his deathbed he by will bequeathd
His lands to me and took it on his death
That this my mothers son was none of his
And if he were he came into the world
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time
Then good my liege let me have what is mine
My fathers land as was my fathers will
Sirrah your brother is legitimate
Your fathers wife did after wedlock bear him
And if she did play false the fault was hers
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
That marry wives Tell me how if my brother
Who as you say took pains to get this son
Had of your father claimd this son for his
In sooth good friend your father might have kept
This calf bred from his cow from all the world
In sooth he might then if he were my brothers
My brother might not claim him nor your father
Being none of his refuse him this concludes
My mothers son did get your fathers heir
Your fathers heir must have your fathers land
Shall then my fathers will be of no force
To dispossess that child which is not his
Of no more force to dispossess me sir
Than was his will to get me as I think
Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
And like thy brother to enjoy thy land
Or the reputed son of Coeurdelion
Lord of thy presence and no land beside
Madam an if my brother had my shape
And I had his sir Roberts his like him
And if my legs were two such ridingrods
My arms such eelskins stuffd my face so thin
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Lest men should say Look where threefarthings goes
And to his shape were heir to all this land
Would I might never stir from off this place
I would give it every foot to have this face
I would not be sir Nob in any case
I like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me
I am a soldier and now bound to France
Brother take you my land Ill take my chance
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year
Yet sell your face for five pence and tis dear
Madam Ill follow you unto the death
Nay I would have you go before me thither
Our country manners give our betters way
What is thy name
Philip my liege so is my name begun
Philip good old sir Roberts wifes eldest son
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearst
Kneel thou down Philip but rise more great
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet
Brother by the mothers side give me your hand
My father gave me honour yours gave land
Now blessed by the hour by night or day
When I was got sir Robert was away
The very spirit of Plantagenet
I am thy grandam Richard call me so
Madam by chance but not by truth what though
Something about a little from the right
In at the window or else oer the hatch
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night
And have is have however men do catch
Near or far off well won is still well shot
And I am I howeer I was begot
Go Faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire
Come madam and come Richard we must speed
For France for France for it is more than need
Brother adieu good fortune come to thee
For thou wast got i the way of honesty
Exeunt all but BASTARD
A foot of honour better than I was
But many a many foot of land the worse
Well now can I make any Joan a lady
Good den sir RichardGodamercy fellow
And if his name be George Ill call him Peter
For newmade honour doth forget mens names
Tis too respective and too sociable
For your conversion Now your traveller
He and his toothpick at my worships mess
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
My picked man of countries My dear sir
Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
I shall beseech youthat is question now
And then comes answer like an Absey book
O sir says answer at your best command
At your employment at your service sir
No sir says question I sweet sir at yours
And so ere answer knows what question would
Saving in dialogue of compliment
And talking of the Alps and Apennines
The Pyrenean and the river Po
It draws toward supper in conclusion so
But this is worshipful society
And fits the mounting spirit like myself
For he is but a bastard to the time
That doth not smack of observation
And so am I whether I smack or no
And not alone in habit and device
Exterior form outward accoutrement
But from the inward motion to deliver
Sweet sweet sweet poison for the ages tooth
Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
But who comes in such haste in ridingrobes
What womanpost is this hath she no husband
That will take pains to blow a horn before her
Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY
O me it is my mother How now good lady
What brings you here to court so hastily
Where is that slave thy brother where is he
That holds in chase mine honour up and down
My brother Robert old sir Roberts son
Colbrand the giant that same mighty man
Is it sir Roberts son that you seek so
Sir Roberts son Ay thou unreverend boy
Sir Roberts son why scornst thou at sir Robert
He is sir Roberts son and so art thou
James Gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile
Good leave good Philip
Philip sparrow James
Theres toys abroad anon Ill tell thee more
Exit GURNEY
Madam I was not old sir Roberts son
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Upon GoodFriday and neer broke his fast
Sir Robert could do well marry to confess
Could he get me Sir Robert could not do it
We know his handiwork therefore good mother
To whom am I beholding for these limbs
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
What means this scorn thou most untoward knave
Knight knight good mother Basiliscolike
What I am dubbd I have it on my shoulder
But mother I am not sir Roberts son
I have disclaimd sir Robert and my land
Legitimation name and all is gone
Then good my mother let me know my father
Some proper man I hope who was it mother
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge
As faithfully as I deny the devil
King Richard Coeurdelion was thy father
By long and vehement suit I was seduced
To make room for him in my husbands bed
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
Thou art the issue of my dear offence
Which was so strongly urged past my defence
Now by this light were I to get again
Madam I would not wish a better father
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth
And so doth yours your fault was not your folly
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
Subjected tribute to commanding love
Against whose fury and unmatched force
The aweless lion could not wage the fight
Nor keep his princely heart from Richards hand
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
May easily win a womans Ay my mother
With all my heart I thank thee for my father
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
When I was got Ill send his soul to hell
Come lady I will show thee to my kin
And they shall say when Richard me begot
If thou hadst said him nay it had been sin
Who says it was he lies I say twas not
Exeunt
Enter AUSTRIA and forces drums etc on one side  on the other KING PHILIP and his power LEWIS ARTHUR CONSTANCE and attendants
Before Angiers well met brave Austria
Arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
Richard that robbd the lion of his heart
And fought the holy wars in Palestine
By this brave duke came early to his grave
And for amends to his posterity
At our importance hither is he come
To spread his colours boy in thy behalf
And to rebuke the usurpation
Of thy unnatural uncle English John
Embrace him love him give him welcome hither
God shall forgive you Coeurdelions death
The rather that you give his offspring life
Shadowing their right under your wings of war
I give you welcome with a powerless hand
But with a heart full of unstained love
Welcome before the gates of Angiers duke
A noble boy Who would not do thee right
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
As seal to this indenture of my love
That to my home I will no more return
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France
Together with that pale that whitefaced shore
Whose foot spurns back the oceans roaring tides
And coops from other lands her islanders
Even till that England hedged in with the main
That waterwalled bulwark still secure
And confident from foreign purposes
Even till that utmost corner of the west
Salute thee for her king till then fair boy
Will I not think of home but follow arms
O take his mothers thanks a widows thanks
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
To make a more requital to your love
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
In such a just and charitable war
Well then to work our cannon shall be bent
Against the brows of this resisting town
Call for our chiefest men of discipline
To cull the plots of best advantages
Well lay before this town our royal bones
Wade to the marketplace in Frenchmens blood
But we will make it subject to this boy
Stay for an answer to your embassy
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
That right in peace which here we urge in war
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed
Enter CHATILLON
A wonder lady lo upon thy wish
Our messenger Chatillon is arrived
What England says say briefly gentle lord
We coldly pause for thee Chatillon speak
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
And stir them up against a mightier task
England impatient of your just demands
Hath put himself in arms the adverse winds
Whose leisure I have stayd have given him time
To land his legions all as soon as I
His marches are expedient to this town
His forces strong his soldiers confident
With him along is come the motherqueen
An Ate stirring him to blood and strife
With her her niece the Lady Blanch of Spain
With them a bastard of the kings deceased
And all the unsettled humours of the land
Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
With ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
To make hazard of new fortunes here
In brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
Than now the English bottoms have waft oer
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide
To do offence and scath in Christendom
Drum beats
The interruption of their churlish drums
Cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
To parley or to fight therefore prepare
How much unlookd for is this expedition
By how much unexpected by so much
We must awake endavour for defence
For courage mounteth with occasion
Let them be welcome then we are prepared
Enter KING JOHN QUEEN ELINOR BLANCH the BASTARD Lords and forces
Peace be to France if France in peace permit
Our just and lineal entrance to our own
If not bleed France and peace ascend to heaven
Whiles we Gods wrathful agent do correct
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven
Peace be to England if that war return
From France to England there to live in peace
England we love and for that Englands sake
With burden of our armour here we sweat
This toil of ours should be a work of thine
But thou from loving England art so far
That thou hast underwrought his lawful king
Cut off the sequence of posterity
Outfaced infant state and done a rape
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown
Look here upon thy brother Geffreys face
These eyes these brows were moulded out of his
Which died in Geffrey and the hand of time
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born
And this his son England was Geffreys right
And this is Geffreys in the name of God
How comes it then that thou art calld a king
When living blood doth in these temples beat
Which owe the crown that thou oermasterest
From whom hast thou this great commission France
To draw my answer from thy articles
From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
In any breast of strong authority
To look into the blots and stains of right
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
And by whose help I mean to chastise it
Alack thou dost usurp authority
Excuse it is to beat usurping down
Who is it thou dost call usurper France
Let me make answer thy usurping son
Out insolent thy bastard shall be king
That thou mayst be a queen and cheque the world
My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband and this boy
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
Than thou and John in manners being as like
As rain to water or devil to his dam
My boy a bastard By my soul I think
His father never was so true begot
It cannot be an if thou wert his mother
Theres a good mother boy that blots thy father
Theres a good grandam boy that would blot thee
Peace
Hear the crier
What the devil art thou
One that will play the devil sir with you
An a may catch your hide and you alone
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
Ill smoke your skincoat an I catch you right
Sirrah look tot i faith I will i faith
O well did he become that lions robe
That did disrobe the lion of that robe
It lies as sightly on the back of him
As great Alcides shows upon an ass
But ass Ill take that burthen from your back
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
What craker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath
Lewis determine what we shall do straight
Women and fools break off your conference
King John this is the very sum of all
England and Ireland Anjou Touraine Maine
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
My life as soon I do defy thee France
Arthur of Bretagne yield thee to my hand
And out of my dear love Ill give thee more
Than eer the coward hand of France can win
Submit thee boy
Come to thy grandam child
Do child go to it grandam child
Give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
Give it a plum a cherry and a fig
Theres a good grandam
Good my mother peace
I would that I were low laid in my grave
I am not worth this coil thats made for me
His mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
Now shame upon you whether she does or no
His grandams wrongs and not his mothers shames
Draws those heavenmoving pearls from his poor eyes
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
Ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
To do him justice and revenge on you
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
Call not me slanderer thou and thine usurp
The dominations royalties and rights
Of this oppressed boy this is thy eldst sons son
Infortunate in nothing but in thee
Thy sins are visited in this poor child
The canon of the law is laid on him
Being but the second generation
Removed from thy sinconceiving womb
Bedlam have done
I have but this to say
That he is not only plagued for her sin
But God hath made her sin and her the plague
On this removed issue plague for her
And with her plague her sin his injury
Her injury the beadle to her sin
All punishd in the person of this child
And all for her a plague upon her
Thou unadvised scold I can produce
A will that bars the title of thy son
Ay who doubts that a will a wicked will
A womans will a cankerd grandams will
Peace lady pause or be more temperate
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
To these illtuned repetitions
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
These men of Angiers let us hear them speak
Whose title they admit Arthurs or Johns
Trumpet sounds Enter certain Citizens upon the walls
Who is it that hath warnd us to the walls
Tis France for England
England for itself
You men of Angiers and my loving subjects
You loving men of Angiers Arthurs subjects
Our trumpet calld you to this gentle parle
For our advantage therefore hear us first
These flags of France that are advanced here
Before the eye and prospect of your town
Have hither marchd to your endamagement
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
Their iron indignation gainst your walls
All preparation for a bloody siege
All merciless proceeding by these French
Confronts your citys eyes your winking gates
And but for our approach those sleeping stones
That as a waist doth girdle you about
By the compulsion of their ordinance
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited and wide havoc made
For bloody power to rush upon your peace
But on the sight of us your lawful king
Who painfully with much expedient march
Have brought a countercheque before your gates
To save unscratchd your citys threatened cheeks
Behold the French amazed vouchsafe a parle
And now instead of bullets wrappd in fire
To make a shaking fever in your walls
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
To make a faithless error in your ears
Which trust accordingly kind citizens
And let us in your king whose labourd spirits
Crave harbourage within your city walls
When I have said make answer to us both
Lo in this right hand whose protection
Is most divinely vowd upon the right
Of him it holds stands young Plantagenet
Son to the elder brother of this man
And king oer him and all that he enjoys
For this downtrodden equity we tread
In warlike march these greens before your town
Being no further enemy to you
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
In the relief of this oppressed child
Religiously provokes Be pleased then
To pay that duty which you truly owe
To that owes it namely this young prince
And then our arms like to a muzzled bear
Save in aspect hath all offence seald up
Our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven
And with a blessed and unvexd retire
With unhackd swords and helmets all unbruised
We will bear home that lusty blood again
Which here we came to spout against your town
And leave your children wives and you in peace
But if you fondly pass our profferd offer
Tis not the roundure of your oldfaced walls
Can hide you from our messengers of war
Though all these English and their discipline
Were harbourd in their rude circumference
Then tell us shall your city call us lord
In that behalf which we have challenged it
Or shall we give the signal to our rage
And stalk in blood to our possession
In brief we are the king of Englands subjects
For him and in his right we hold this town
Acknowledge then the king and let me in
That can we not but he that proves the king
To him will we prove loyal till that time
Have we rammd up our gates against the world
Doth not the crown of England prove the king
And if not that I bring you witnesses
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of Englands breed
Bastards and else
To verify our title with their lives
As many and as wellborn bloods as those
Some bastards too
Stand in his face to contradict his claim
Till you compound whose right is worthiest
We for the worthiest hold the right from both
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
That to their everlasting residence
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
In dreadful trial of our kingdoms king
Amen amen Mount chevaliers to arms
Saint George that swinged the dragon and eer since
Sits on his horseback at mine hostess door
Teach us some fence
To AUSTRIA
Sirrah were I at home
At your den sirrah with your lioness
I would set an oxhead to your lions hide
And make a monster of you
Peace no more
O tremble for you hear the lion roar
Up higher to the plain where well set forth
In best appointment all our regiments
Speed then to take advantage of the field
It shall be so and at the other hill
Command the rest to stand God and our right
Exeunt
Here after excursions enter the Herald of France with trumpets to the gates
You men of Angiers open wide your gates
And let young Arthur Duke of Bretagne in
Who by the hand of France this day hath made
Much work for tears in many an English mother
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
Many a widows husband grovelling lies
Coldly embracing the discolourd earth
And victory with little loss doth play
Upon the dancing banners of the French
Who are at hand triumphantly displayd
To enter conquerors and to proclaim
Arthur of Bretagne Englands king and yours
Enter English Herald with trumpet
Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells
King John your king and Englands doth approach
Commander of this hot malicious day
Their armours that marchd hence so silverbright
Hither return all gilt with Frenchmens blood
There stuck no plume in any English crest
That is removed by a staff of France
Our colours do return in those same hands
That did display them when we first marchd forth
And like a troop of jolly huntsmen come
Our lusty English all with purpled hands
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes
Open your gates and gives the victors way
Heralds from off our towers we might behold
From first to last the onset and retire
Of both your armies whose equality
By our best eyes cannot be censured
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows
Strength matchd with strength and power confronted power
Both are alike and both alike we like
One must prove greatest while they weigh so even
We hold our town for neither yet for both
Reenter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP with their powers severally
France hast thou yet more blood to cast away
Say shall the current of our right run on
Whose passage vexd with thy impediment
Shall leave his native channel and oerswell
With course disturbd even thy confining shores
Unless thou let his silver water keep
A peaceful progress to the ocean
England thou hast not saved one drop of blood
In this hot trial more than we of France
Rather lost more And by this hand I swear
That sways the earth this climate overlooks
Before we will lay down our justborne arms
Well put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
Or add a royal number to the dead
Gracing the scroll that tells of this wars loss
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings
Ha majesty how high thy glory towers
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire
O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel
The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
In undetermined differences of kings
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
Cry havoc kings back to the stained field
You equal potents fiery kindled spirits
Then let confusion of one part confirm
The others peace till then blows blood and death
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit
Speak citizens for England whos your king
The king of England when we know the king
Know him in us that here hold up his right
In us that are our own great deputy
And bear possession of our person here
Lord of our presence Angiers and of you
A greater power then we denies all this
And till it be undoubted we do lock
Our former scruple in our strongbarrd gates
Kingd of our fears until our fears resolved
Be by some certain king purged and deposed
By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings
And stand securely on their battlements
As in a theatre whence they gape and point
Your royal presences be ruled by me
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths
Till their soulfearing clamours have brawld down
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
Ild play incessantly upon these jades
Even till unfenced desolation
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air
That done dissever your united strengths
And part your mingled colours once again
Turn face to face and bloody point to point
Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
Out of one side her happy minion
To whom in favour she shall give the day
And kiss him with a glorious victory
How like you this wild counsel mighty states
Smacks it not something of the policy
Now by the sky that hangs above our heads
I like it well France shall we knit our powers
And lay this Angiers even to the ground
Then after fight who shall be king of it
An if thou hast the mettle of a king
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
As we will ours against these saucy walls
And when that we have dashd them to the ground
Why then defy each other and pellmell
Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
Let it be so Say where will you assault
We from the west will send destruction
Into this citys bosom
I from the north
Our thunder from the south
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
O prudent discipline From north to south
Austria and France shoot in each others mouth
Ill stir them to it Come away away
Hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
And I shall show you peace and fairfaced league
Win you this city without stroke or wound
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
That here come sacrifices for the field
Persever not but hear me mighty kings
Speak on with favour we are bent to hear
That daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch
Is niece to England look upon the years
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch
If zealous love should go in search of virtue
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch
If love ambitious sought a match of birth
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch
Such as she is in beauty virtue birth
Is the young Dauphin every way complete
If not complete of say he is not she
And she again wants nothing to name want
If want it be not that she is not he
He is the half part of a blessed man
Left to be finished by such as she
And she a fair divided excellence
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him
O two such silver currents when they join
Do glorify the banks that bound them in
And two such shores to two such streams made one
Two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
To these two princes if you marry them
This union shall do more than battery can
To our fastclosed gates for at this match
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
And give you entrance but without this match
The sea enraged is not half so deaf
Lions more confident mountains and rocks
More free from motion no not Death himself
In moral fury half so peremptory
As we to keep this city
Heres a stay
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
Out of his rags Heres a large mouth indeed
That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
As maids of thirteen do of puppydogs
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood
He speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce
He gives the bastinado with his tongue
Our ears are cudgelld not a word of his
But buffets better than a fist of France
Zounds I was never so bethumpd with words
Since I first calld my brothers father dad
Son list to this conjunction make this match
Give with our niece a dowry large enough
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
I see a yielding in the looks of France
Mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
Are capable of this ambition
Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
Of soft petitions pity and remorse
Cool and congeal again to what it was
Why answer not the double majesties
This friendly treaty of our threatend town
Speak England first that hath been forward first
To speak unto this city what say you
If that the Dauphin there thy princely son
Can in this book of beauty read I love
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers
And all that we upon this side the sea
Except this city now by us besieged
Find liable to our crown and dignity
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
In titles honours and promotions
As she in beauty education blood
Holds hand with any princess of the world
What sayst thou boy look in the ladys face
I do my lord and in her eye I find
A wonder or a wondrous miracle
The shadow of myself formd in her eye
Which being but the shadow of your son
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
I do protest I never loved myself
Till now infixed I beheld myself
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye
Whispers with BLANCH
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye
Hangd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
And quarterd in her heart he doth espy
Himself loves traitor this is pity now
That hangd and drawn and quartered there should be
In such a love so vile a lout as he
My uncles will in this respect is mine
If he see aught in you that makes him like
That any thing he sees which moves his liking
I can with ease translate it to my will
Or if you will to speak more properly
I will enforce it easily to my love
Further I will not flatter you my lord
That all I see in you is worthy love
Than this that nothing do I see in you
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
That I can find should merit any hate
What say these young ones What say you my niece
That she is bound in honour still to do
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
Speak then prince Dauphin can you love this lady
Nay ask me if I can refrain from love
For I do love her most unfeignedly
Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine
Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces
With her to thee and this addition more
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin
Philip of France if thou be pleased withal
Command thy son and daughter to join hands
It likes us well young princes close your hands
And your lips too for I am well assured
That I did so when I was first assured
Now citizens of Angiers ope your gates
Let in that amity which you have made
For at Saint Marys chapel presently
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop
I know she is not for this match made up
Her presence would have interrupted much
Where is she and her son tell me who knows
She is sad and passionate at your highness tent
And by my faith this league that we have made
Will give her sadness very little cure
Brother of England how may we content
This widow lady In her right we came
Which we God knows have turnd another way
To our own vantage
We will heal up all
For well create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town
We make him lord of Call the Lady Constance
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
To our solemnity I trust we shall
If not fill up the measure of her will
Yet in some measure satisfy her so
That we shall stop her exclamation
Go we as well as haste will suffer us
To this unlookd for unprepared pomp
Exeunt all but the BASTARD
Mad world mad kings mad composition
John to stop Arthurs title in the whole
Hath willingly departed with a part
And France whose armour conscience buckled on
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
As Gods own soldier rounded in the ear
With that same purposechanger that sly devil
That broker that still breaks the pate of faith
That daily breakvow he that wins of all
Of kings of beggars old men young men maids
Who having no external thing to lose
But the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
That smoothfaced gentleman tickling Commodity
Commodity the bias of the world
The world who of itself is peised well
Made to run even upon even ground
Till this advantage this viledrawing bias
This sway of motion this Commodity
Makes it take head from all indifferency
From all direction purpose course intent
And this same bias this Commodity
This bawd this broker this allchanging word
Clappd on the outward eye of fickle France
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid
From a resolved and honourable war
To a most base and vileconcluded peace
And why rail I on this Commodity
But for because he hath not wood me yet
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
When his fair angels would salute my palm
But for my hand as unattempted yet
Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail
And say there is no sin but to be rich
And being rich my virtue then shall be
To say there is no vice but beggary
Since kings break faith upon commodity
Gain be my lord for I will worship thee
Exit
Enter CONSTANCE ARTHUR and SALISBURY
Gone to be married gone to swear a peace
False blood to false blood joind gone to be friends
Shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces
It is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
Be well advised tell oer thy tale again
It cannot be thou dost but say tis so
I trust I may not trust thee for thy word
Is but the vain breath of a common man
Believe me I do not believe thee man
I have a kings oath to the contrary
Thou shalt be punishd for thus frighting me
For I am sick and capable of fears
Oppressd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
A widow husbandless subject to fears
A woman naturally born to fears
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest
With my vexd spirits I cannot take a truce
But they will quake and tremble all this day
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son
What means that hand upon that breast of thine
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
Like a proud river peering oer his bounds
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
Then speak again not all thy former tale
But this one word whether thy tale be true
As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true
O if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die
Lewis marry Blanch O boy then where art thou
France friend with England what becomes of me
Fellow be gone I cannot brook thy sight
This news hath made thee a most ugly man
What other harm have I good lady done
But spoke the harm that is by others done
Which harm within itself so heinous is
As it makes harmful all that speak of it
I do beseech you madam be content
If thou that bidst me be content wert grim
Ugly and slanderous to thy mothers womb
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
Lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
Patchd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks
I would not care I then would be content
For then I should not love thee no nor thou
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
Nature and Fortune joind to make thee great
Of Natures gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
And with the halfblown rose But Fortune O
She is corrupted changed and won from thee
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John
And with her golden hand hath pluckd on France
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John
That strumpet Fortune that usurping John
Tell me thou fellow is not France forsworn
Envenom him with words or get thee gone
And leave those woes alone which I alone
Am bound to underbear
Pardon me madam
I may not go without you to the kings
Thou mayst thou shalt I will not go with thee
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
To me and to the state of my great grief
Let kings assemble for my griefs so great
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Can hold it up here I and sorrows sit
Here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
Seats herself on the ground
Enter KING JOHN KING PHILLIP LEWIS BLANCH QUEEN ELINOR the BASTARD AUSTRIA and Attendants
Tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
Ever in France shall be kept festival
To solemnize this day the glorious sun
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist
Turning with splendor of his precious eye
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
The yearly course that brings this day about
Shall never see it but a holiday
A wicked day and not a holy day
Rising
What hath this day deserved what hath it done
That it in golden letters should be set
Among the high tides in the calendar
Nay rather turn this day out of the week
This day of shame oppression perjury
Or if it must stand still let wives with child
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossd
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck
No bargains break that are not this day made
This day all things begun come to ill end
Yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
By heaven lady you shall have no cause
To curse the fair proceedings of this day
Have I not pawnd to you my majesty
You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
Resembling majesty which being touchd and tried
Proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
You came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace
And our oppression hath made up this league
Arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings
A widow cries be husband to me heavens
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
Set armed discord twixt these perjured kings
Hear me O hear me
Lady Constance peace
War war no peace peace is to me a war
O Lymoges O Austria thou dost shame
That bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward
Thou little valiant great in villany
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side
Thou Fortunes champion that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety thou art perjured too
And soothest up greatness What a fool art thou
A ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
Upon my party Thou coldblooded slave
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
Been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
Upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
And dost thou now fall over to my fores
Thou wear a lions hide doff it for shame
And hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs
O that a man should speak those words to me
And hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs
Thou darest not say so villain for thy life
And hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs
We like not this thou dost forget thyself
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
Here comes the holy legate of the pope
Hail you anointed deputies of heaven
To thee King John my holy errand is
I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal
And from Pope Innocent the legate here
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the church our holy mother
So wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
Keep Stephen Langton chosen archbishop
Of Canterbury from that holy see
This in our foresaid holy fathers name
Pope Innocent I do demand of thee
What earthy name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king
Thou canst not cardinal devise a name
So slight unworthy and ridiculous
To charge me to an answer as the pope
Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions
But as we under heaven are supreme head
So under Him that great supremacy
Where we do reign we will alone uphold
Without the assistance of a mortal hand
So tell the pope all reverence set apart
To him and his usurpd authority
Brother of England you blaspheme in this
Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest
Dreading the curse that money may buy out
And by the merit of vile gold dross dust
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
Yet I alone alone do me oppose
Against the pope and count his friends my foes
Then by the lawful power that I have
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to an heretic
And meritorious shall that hand be calld
Canonized and worshipped as a saint
That takes away by any secret course
Thy hateful life
O lawful let it be
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile
Good father cardinal cry thou amen
To my keen curses for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right
Theres law and warrant lady for my curse
And for mine too when law can do no right
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law
Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse
Philip of France on peril of a curse
Let go the hand of that archheretic
And raise the power of France upon his head
Unless he do submit himself to Rome
Lookst thou pale France do not let go thy hand
Look to that devil lest that France repent
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
King Philip listen to the cardinal
And hang a calfsskin on his recreant limbs
Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs Because
Your breeches best may carry them
Philip what sayst thou to the cardinal
What should he say but as the cardinal
Bethink you father for the difference
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
Or the light loss of England for a friend
Forego the easier
Thats the curse of Rome
O Lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith
But from her need
O if thou grant my need
Which only lives but by the death of faith
That need must needs infer this principle
That faith would live again by death of need
O then tread down my need and faith mounts up
Keep my need up and faith is trodden down
The king is moved and answers not to this
O be removed from him and answer well
Do so King Philip hang no more in doubt
Hang nothing but a calfsskin most sweet lout
I am perplexd and know not what to say
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed
Good reverend father make my person yours
And tell me how you would bestow yourself
This royal hand and mine are newly knit
And the conjunction of our inward souls
Married in league coupled and linked together
With all religious strength of sacred vows
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Was deepsworn faith peace amity true love
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves
And even before this truce but new before
No longer than we well could wash our hands
To clap this royal bargain up of peace
Heaven knows they were besmeard and overstaind
With slaughters pencil where revenge did paint
The fearful difference of incensed kings
And shall these hands so lately purged of blood
So newly joind in love so strong in both
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
Play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
Make such unconstant children of ourselves
As now again to snatch our palm from palm
Unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host
And make a riot on the gentle brow
Of true sincerity O holy sir
My reverend father let it not be so
Out of your grace devise ordain impose
Some gentle order and then we shall be blest
To do your pleasure and continue friends
All form is formless order orderless
Save what is opposite to Englands love
Therefore to arms be champion of our church
Or let the church our mother breathe her curse
A mothers curse on her revolting son
France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
A chafed lion by the mortal paw
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
I may disjoin my hand but not my faith
So makest thou faith an enemy to faith
And like a civil war setst oath to oath
Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow
First made to heaven first be to heaven performd
That is to be the champion of our church
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done
And being not done where doing tends to ill
The truth is then most done not doing it
Is to mistake again though indirect
Yet indirection thereby grows direct
And falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire
Within the scorched veins of one newburnd
It is religion that doth make vows kept
But thou hast sworn against religion
By what thou swearst against the thing thou swearst
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
Against an oath the truth thou art unsure
To swear swears only not to be forsworn
Else what a mockery should it be to swear
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions
Upon which better part our prayers come in
If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know
The peril of our curses light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
But in despair die under their black weight
Rebellion flat rebellion
Willt not be
Will not a calfsskin stop that mouth of thine
Father to arms
Upon thy weddingday
Against the blood that thou hast married
What shall our feast be kept with slaughterd men
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
Clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
O husband hear me ay alack how new
Is husband in my mouth even for that name
Which till this time my tongue did neer pronounce
Upon my knee I beg go not to arms
Against mine uncle
O upon my knee
Made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee
Thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven
Now shall I see thy love what motive may
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds
His honour O thine honour Lewis thine honour
I muse your majesty doth seem so cold
When such profound respects do pull you on
I will denounce a curse upon his head
Thou shalt not need England I will fall from thee
O fair return of banishd majesty
O foul revolt of French inconstancy
France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
Old Time the clocksetter that bald sexton Time
Is it as he will well then France shall rue
The suns oercast with blood fair day adieu
Which is the side that I must go withal
I am with both each army hath a hand
And in their rage I having hold of both
They swirl asunder and dismember me
Husband I cannot pray that thou mayst win
Uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose
Father I may not wish the fortune thine
Grandam I will not wish thy fortunes thrive
Whoever wins on that side shall I lose
Assured loss before the match be playd
Lady with me with me thy fortune lies
There where my fortune lives there my life dies
Cousin go draw our puissance together
Exit BASTARD
France I am burnd up with inflaming wrath
A rage whose heat hath this condition
That nothing can allay nothing but blood
The blood and dearestvalued blood of France
Thy rage sham burn thee up and thou shalt turn
To ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
Look to thyself thou art in jeopardy
No more than he that threats To arms lets hie

Cousin look not sad
Thy grandam loves thee and thy uncle will
As dear be to thee as thy father was
O this will make my mother die with grief
To the BASTARD  Cousin away for England

And ere our coming see thou shake the bags
Of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels
Set at liberty the fat ribs of peace
Must by the hungry now be fed upon
Use our commission in his utmost force
Bell book and candle shall not drive me back
When gold and silver becks me to come on
I leave your highness Grandam I will pray
If ever I remember to be holy
For your fair safety so I kiss your hand
Farewell gentle cousin
Coz farewell
Exit the BASTARD
Come hither little kinsman hark a word
Come hither Hubert O my gentle Hubert
We owe thee much within this wall of flesh
There is a soul counts thee her creditor
And with advantage means to pay thy love
And my good friend thy voluntary oath
Lives in this bosom dearly cherished
Give me thy hand I had a thing to say
But I will fit it with some better time
By heaven Hubert I am almost ashamed
To say what good respect I have of thee
I am much bounden to your majesty
Good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
But thou shalt have and creep time neer so slow
Yet it shall come from me to do thee good
I had a thing to say but let it go
The sun is in the heaven and the proud day
Attended with the pleasures of the world
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
To give me audience if the midnight bell
Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
Sound on into the drowsy race of night
If this same were a churchyard where we stand
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
Or if that surly spirit melancholy
Had baked thy blood and made it heavythick
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins
Making that idiot laughter keep mens eyes
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment
A passion hateful to my purposes
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
Hear me without thine ears and make reply
Without a tongue using conceit alone
Without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
Then in despite of brooded watchful day
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
But ah I will not yet I love thee well
And by my troth I think thou lovest me well
So well that what you bid me undertake
By heaven I would do it
Do not I know thou wouldst
Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye
On yon young boy Ill tell thee what my friend
He is a very serpent in my way
And wheresoer this foot of mine doth tread
He lies before me dost thou understand me
Thou art his keeper
And Ill keep him so
That he shall not offend your majesty
Death
My lord
A grave
He shall not live
Enough
I could be merry now Hubert I love thee
Well Ill not say what I intend for thee
Remember Madam fare you well
Ill send those powers oer to your majesty
My blessing go with thee
For England cousin go
Hubert shall be your man attend on you
With all true duty On toward Calais ho
Exeunt
Enter KING PHILIP LEWIS CARDINAL PANDULPH and Attendants
So by a roaring tempest on the flood
A whole armado of convicted sail
Is scatterd and disjoind from fellowship
Courage and comfort all shall yet go well
What can go well when we have run so ill
Are we not beaten Is not Angiers lost
Arthur taen prisoner divers dear friends slain
And bloody England into England gone
Oerbearing interruption spite of France
What he hath won that hath he fortified
So hot a speed with such advice disposed
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause
Doth want example who hath read or heard
Well could I bear that England had this praise
So we could find some pattern of our shame
Enter CONSTANCE
Look who comes here a grave unto a soul
Holding the eternal spirit against her will
In the vile prison of afflicted breath
I prithee lady go away with me
Lo now I now see the issue of your peace
Patience good lady comfort gentle Constance
No I defy all counsel all redress
But that which ends all counsel true redress
Death death O amiable lovely death
Thou odouriferous stench sound rottenness
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night
Thou hate and terror to prosperity
And I will kiss thy detestable bones
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
And ring these fingers with thy household worms
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
And be a carrion monster like thyself
Come grin on me and I will think thou smilest
And buss thee as thy wife Miserys love
O come to me
O fair affliction peace
No no I will not having breath to cry
O that my tongue were in the thunders mouth
Then with a passion would I shake the world
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Which cannot hear a ladys feeble voice
Which scorns a modern invocation
Lady you utter madness and not sorrow
Thou art not holy to belie me so
I am not mad this hair I tear is mine
My name is Constance I was Geffreys wife
Young Arthur is my son and he is lost
I am not mad I would to heaven I were
For then tis like I should forget myself
O if I could what grief should I forget
Preach some philosophy to make me mad
And thou shalt be canonized cardinal
For being not mad but sensible of grief
My reasonable part produces reason
How I may be deliverd of these woes
And teaches me to kill or hang myself
If I were mad I should forget my son
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he
I am not mad too well too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity
Bind up those tresses O what love I note
In the fair multitude of those her hairs
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
Do glue themselves in sociable grief
Like true inseparable faithful loves
Sticking together in calamity
To England if you will
Bind up your hairs
Yes that I will and wherefore will I do it
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
O that these hands could so redeem my son
As they have given these hairs their liberty
But now I envy at their liberty
And will again commit them to their bonds
Because my poor child is a prisoner
And father cardinal I have heard you say
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven
If that be true I shall see my boy again
For since the birth of Cain the first male child
To him that did but yesterday suspire
There was not such a gracious creature born
But now will cankersorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek
And he will look as hollow as a ghost
As dim and meagre as an agues fit
And so hell die and rising so again
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him therefore never never
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more
You hold too heinous a respect of grief
He talks to me that never had a son
You are as fond of grief as of your child
Grief fills the room up of my absent child
Lies in his bed walks up and down with me
Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
Remembers me of all his gracious parts
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
Then have I reason to be fond of grief
Fare you well had you such a loss as I
I could give better comfort than you do
I will not keep this form upon my head
When there is such disorder in my wit
O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son
My life my joy my food my all the world
My widowcomfort and my sorrows cure
Exit
I fear some outrage and Ill follow her
Exit
Theres nothing in this world can make me joy
Life is as tedious as a twicetold tale
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
And bitter shame hath spoild the sweet worlds taste
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness
Before the curing of a strong disease
Even in the instant of repair and health
The fit is strongest evils that take leave
On their departure most of all show evil
What have you lost by losing of this day
All days of glory joy and happiness
If you had won it certainly you had
No no when Fortune means to men most good
She looks upon them with a threatening eye
Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
In this which he accounts so clearly won
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner
As heartily as he is glad he hath him
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
Out of the path which shall directly lead
Thy foot to Englands throne and therefore mark
John hath seized Arthur and it cannot be
That whiles warm life plays in that infants veins
The misplaced John should entertain an hour
One minute nay one quiet breath of rest
A sceptre snatchd with an unruly hand
Must be as boisterously maintaind as gaind
And he that stands upon a slippery place
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall
So be it for it cannot be but so
But what shall I gain by young Arthurs fall
You in the right of Lady Blanch your wife
May then make all the claim that Arthur did
And lose it life and all as Arthur did
How green you are and fresh in this old world
John lays you plots the times conspire with you
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To cheque his reign but they will cherish it
No natural exhalation in the sky
No scope of nature no distemperd day
No common wind no customed event
But they will pluck away his natural cause
And call them meteors prodigies and signs
Abortives presages and tongues of heaven
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John
May be he will not touch young Arthurs life
But hold himself safe in his prisonment
O sir when he shall hear of your approach
If that young Arthur be not gone already
Even at that news he dies and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers ends of John
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot
And O what better matter breeds for you
Than I have named The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England ransacking the church
Offending charity if but a dozen French
Were there in arms they would be as a call
To train ten thousand English to their side
Or as a little snow tumbled about
Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin
Go with me to the king tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent
Now that their souls are topful of offence
For England go I will whet on the king
If you say ay the king will not say no
Exeunt
Enter HUBERT and Executioners
Heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
Within the arras when I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed
Uncleanly scruples fear not you look tot
Exeunt Executioners
Young lad come forth I have to say with you
Enter ARTHUR
Good morrow Hubert
Good morrow little prince
As little prince having so great a title
To be more prince as may be You are sad
Indeed I have been merrier
Mercy on me
Methinks no body should be sad but I
Yet I remember when I was in France
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night
Only for wantonness By my christendom
So I were out of prison and kept sheep
I should be as merry as the day is long
And so I would be here but that I doubt
He is afraid of me and I of him
Is it my fault that I was Geffreys son
No indeed ist not and I would to heaven
I were your son so you would love me Hubert
Aside  If I talk to him with his innocent prate
He will awake my mercy which lies dead
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch
Are you sick Hubert you look pale today
In sooth I would you were a little sick
That I might sit all night and watch with you
I warrant I love you more than you do me
Aside  His words do take possession of my bosom
Read here young Arthur
Showing a paper
Aside
How now foolish rheum
Turning dispiteous torture out of door
I must be brief lest resolution drop
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
Can you not read it Is it not fair writ
Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
Young boy I must
And will you
And I will
Have you the heart When your head did but ache
I knit my handercher about your brows
The best I had a princess wrought it me
And I did never ask it you again
And with my hand at midnight held your head
And like the watchful minutes to the hour
Still and anon cheerd up the heavy time
Saying What lack you and Where lies your grief
Or What good love may I perform for you
Many a poor mans son would have lien still
And neer have spoke a loving word to you
But you at your sick service had a prince
Nay you may think my love was crafty love
And call it cunning do an if you will
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill
Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes
These eyes that never did nor never shall
So much as frown on you
I have sworn to do it
And with hot irons must I burn them out
Ah none but in this iron age would do it
The iron of itself though heat redhot
Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
And quench his fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence
Nay after that consume away in rust
But for containing fire to harm mine eye
Are you more stubbornhard than hammerd iron
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes
I would not have believed himno tongue but Huberts
Come forth
Stamps
Reenter Executioners with a cord irons  and c
Do as I bid you do
O save me Hubert save me my eyes are out
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
Give me the iron I say and bind him here
Alas what need you be so boisterousrough
I will not struggle I will stand stonestill
For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound
Nay hear me Hubert drive these men away
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb
I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
Nor look upon the iron angerly
Thrust but these men away and Ill forgive you
Whatever torment you do put me to
Go stand within let me alone with him
I am best pleased to be from such a deed
Exeunt Executioners
Alas I then have chid away my friend
He hath a stern look but a gentle heart
Let him come back that his compassion may
Give life to yours
Come boy prepare yourself
Is there no remedy
None but to lose your eyes
O heaven that there were but a mote in yours
A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
Any annoyance in that precious sense
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible
Is this your promise go to hold your tongue
Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert
Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue
So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes
Though to no use but still to look on you
Lo by my truth the instrument is cold
And would not harm me
I can heat it boy
No in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
Being create for comfort to be used
In undeserved extremes see else yourself
There is no malice in this burning coal
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
And strewd repentent ashes on his head
But with my breath I can revive it boy
An if you do you will but make it blush
And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert
Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
And like a dog that is compelld to fight
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
All things that you should use to do me wrong
Deny their office only you do lack
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
Creatures of note for mercylacking uses
Well see to live I will not touch thine eye
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose boy
With this same very iron to burn them out
O now you look like Hubert all this while
You were disguised
Peace no more Adieu
Your uncle must not know but you are dead
Ill fill these dogged spies with false reports
And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
That Hubert for the wealth of all the world
Will not offend thee
O heaven I thank you Hubert
Silence no more go closely in with me
Much danger do I undergo for thee
Exeunt
Enter KING JOHN PEMBROKE SALISBURY and other Lords
Here once again we sit once again crownd
And looked upon I hope with cheerful eyes
This once again but that your highness pleased
Was once superfluous you were crownd before
And that high royalty was neer pluckd off
The faiths of men neer stained with revolt
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
With any longdfor change or better state
Therefore to be possessd with double pomp
To guard a title that was rich before
To gild refined gold to paint the lily
To throw a perfume on the violet
To smooth the ice or add another hue
Unto the rainbow or with taperlight
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess
But that your royal pleasure must be done
And in the last repeating troublesome
Being urged at a time unseasonable
In this the antique and well noted face
Of plain old form is much disfigured
And like a shifted wind unto a sail
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
Startles and frights consideration
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
For putting on so new a fashiond robe
When workmen strive to do better than well
They do confound their skill in covetousness
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse
As patches set upon a little breach
Discredit more in hiding of the fault
Than did the fault before it was so patchd
To this effect before you were new crownd
We breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness
To overbear it and we are all well pleased
Since all and every part of what we would
Doth make a stand at what your highness will
Some reasons of this double coronation
I have possessd you with and think them strong
And more more strong then lesser is my fear
I shall indue you with meantime but ask
What you would have reformd that is not well
And well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your requests
Then I as one that am the tongue of these
To sound the purpose of all their hearts
Both for myself and them but chief of all
Your safety for the which myself and them
Bend their best studies heartily request
The enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
To break into this dangerous argument
If what in rest you have in right you hold
Why then your fears which as they say attend
The steps of wrong should move you to mew up
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
The rich advantage of good exercise
That the times enemies may not have this
To grace occasions let it be our suit
That you have bid us ask his liberty
Which for our goods we do no further ask
Than whereupon our weal on you depending
Counts it your weal he have his liberty
Enter HUBERT
Let it be so I do commit his youth
To your direction Hubert what news with you
Taking him apart
This is the man should do the bloody deed
He showd his warrant to a friend of mine
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye that close aspect of his
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast
And I do fearfully believe tis done
What we so feard he had a charge to do
The colour of the king doth come and go
Between his purpose and his conscience
Like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
His passion is so ripe it needs must break
And when it breaks I fear will issue thence
The foul corruption of a sweet childs death
We cannot hold mortalitys strong hand
Good lords although my will to give is living
The suit which you demand is gone and dead
He tells us Arthur is deceased tonight
Indeed we feard his sickness was past cure
Indeed we heard how near his death he was
Before the child himself felt he was sick
This must be answerd either here or hence
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me
Think you I bear the shears of destiny
Have I commandment on the pulse of life
It is apparent foul play and tis shame
That greatness should so grossly offer it
So thrive it in your game and so farewell
Stay yet Lord Salisbury Ill go with thee
And find the inheritance of this poor child
His little kingdom of a forced grave
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
Three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
This must not be thus borne this will break out
To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt
Exeunt Lords
They burn in indignation I repent
There is no sure foundation set on blood
No certain life achieved by others death
Enter a Messenger
A fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks
So foul a sky clears not without a storm
Pour down thy weather how goes all in France
From France to England Never such a power
For any foreign preparation
Was levied in the body of a land
The copy of your speed is learnd by them
For when you should be told they do prepare
The tidings come that they are all arrived
O where hath our intelligence been drunk
Where hath it slept Where is my mothers care
That such an army could be drawn in France
And she not hear of it
My liege her ear
Is stoppd with dust the first of April died
Your noble mother and as I hear my lord
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
Three days before but this from rumours tongue
I idly heard if true or false I know not
Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
O make a league with me till I have pleased
My discontented peers What mother dead
How wildly then walks my estate in France
Under whose conduct came those powers of France
That thou for truth givest out are landed here
Under the Dauphin
Thou hast made me giddy
With these ill tidings
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret
Now what says the world
To your proceedings do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news for it is full
But if you be afeard to hear the worst
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead
Bear with me cousin for I was amazed
Under the tide but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood and can give audience
To any tongue speak it of what it will
How I have sped among the clergymen
The sums I have collected shall express
But as I travelld hither through the land
I find the people strangely fantasied
Possessd with rumours full of idle dreams
Not knowing what they fear but full of fear
And here a prophet that I brought with me
From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found
With many hundreds treading on his heels
To whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes
That ere the next Ascensionday at noon
Your highness should deliver up your crown
Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
Hubert away with him imprison him
And on that day at noon whereon he says
I shall yield up my crown let him be hangd
Deliver him to safety and return
For I must use thee
Exeunt HUBERT with PETER
O my gentle cousin
Hearst thou the news abroad who are arrived
The French my lord mens mouths are full of it
Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury
With eyes as red as newenkindled fire
And others more going to seek the grave
Of Arthur who they say is killd tonight
On your suggestion
Gentle kinsman go
And thrust thyself into their companies
I have a way to win their loves again
Bring them before me
I will seek them out
Nay but make haste the better foot before
O let me have no subject enemies
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion
Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels
And fly like thought from them to me again
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed
Exit
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
Go after him for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers
And be thou he
With all my heart my liege
Exit
My mother dead
Reenter HUBERT
My lord they say five moons were seen tonight
Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
The other four in wondrous motion
Five moons
Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously
Young Arthurs death is common in their mouths
And when they talk of him they shake their heads
And whisper one another in the ear
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearers wrist
With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
With open mouth swallowing a tailors news
Who with his shears and measure in his hand
Standing on slippers which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
Told of a many thousand warlike French
That were embattailed and rankd in Kent
Another lean unwashd artificer
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthurs death
Why seekst thou to possess me with these fears
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthurs death
Thy hand hath murderd him I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
No had my lord why did you not provoke me
It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
More upon humour than advised respect
Here is your hand and seal for what I did
O when the last account twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by
A fellow by the hand of nature markd
Quoted and signd to do a deed of shame
This murder had not come into my mind
But taking note of thy abhorrd aspect
Finding thee fit for bloody villany
Apt liable to be employd in danger
I faintly broke with thee of Arthurs death
And thou to be endeared to a king
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince
My lord
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed
Or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face
As bid me tell my tale in express words
Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin
Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name
Out of my sight and never see me more
My nobles leave me and my state is braved
Even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers
Nay in the body of this fleshly land
This kingdom this confine of blood and breath
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Between my conscience and my cousins death
Arm you against your other enemies
Ill make a peace between your soul and you
Young Arthur is alive this hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood
Within this bosom never enterd yet
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought
And you have slanderd nature in my form
Which howsoever rude exteriorly
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Than to be butcher of an innocent child
Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers
Throw this report on their incensed rage
And make them tame to their obedience
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature for my rage was blind
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more hideous than thou art
O answer not but to my closet bring
The angry lords with all expedient haste
I conjure thee but slowly run more fast
Exeunt
Enter ARTHUR on the walls
The wall is high and yet will I leap down
Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
Theres few or none do know me if they did
This shipboys semblance hath disguised me quite
I am afraid and yet Ill venture it
If I get down and do not break my limbs
Ill find a thousand shifts to get away
As good to die and go as die and stay
Leaps down
O me my uncles spirit is in these stones
Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones
Dies
Enter PEMBROKE SALISBURY and BIGOT
Lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury
It is our safety and we must embrace
This gentle offer of the perilous time
Who brought that letter from the cardinal
The Count Melun a noble lord of France
Whose private with me of the Dauphins love
Is much more general than these lines import
Tomorrow morning let us meet him then
Or rather then set forward for twill be
Two long days journey lords or ere we meet
Enter the BASTARD
Once more today well met distemperd lords
The king by me requests your presence straight
The king hath dispossessd himself of us
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
With our pure honours nor attend the foot
That leaves the print of blood whereer it walks
Return and tell him so we know the worst
Whateer you think good words I think were best
Our griefs and not our manners reason now
But there is little reason in your grief
Therefore twere reason you had manners now
Sir sir impatience hath his privilege
Tis true to hurt his master no man else
This is the prison What is he lies here
Seeing ARTHUR
O death made proud with pure and princely beauty
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed
Murder as hating what himself hath done
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge
Or when he doomd this beauty to a grave
Found it too preciousprincely for a grave
Sir Richard what think you have you beheld
Or have you read or heard or could you think
Or do you almost think although you see
That you do see could thought without this object
Form such another This is the very top
The height the crest or crest unto the crest
Of murders arms this is the bloodiest shame
The wildest savagery the vilest stroke
That ever walleyed wrath or staring rage
Presented to the tears of soft remorse
All murders past do stand excused in this
And this so sole and so unmatchable
Shall give a holiness a purity
To the yet unbegotten sin of times
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
Exampled by this heinous spectacle
It is a damned and a bloody work
If that it be the work of any hand
If that it be the work of any hand
We had a kind of light what would ensue
It is the shameful work of Huberts hand
From whose obedience I forbid my soul
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
And breathing to his breathless excellence
The incense of a vow a holy vow
Never to taste the pleasures of the world
Never to be infected with delight
Nor conversant with ease and idleness
Till I have set a glory to this hand
By giving it the worship of revenge
Our souls religiously confirm thy words
Enter HUBERT
Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you
Arthur doth live the king hath sent for you
O he is old and blushes not at death
Avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
I am no villain
Must I rob the law
Drawing his sword
Your sword is bright sir put it up again
Not till I sheathe it in a murderers skin
Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say
By heaven I think my swords as sharp as yours
I would not have you lord forget yourself
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence
Lest I by marking of your rage forget
Your worth your greatness and nobility
Out dunghill darest thou brave a nobleman
Not for my life but yet I dare defend
My innocent life against an emperor
Thou art a murderer
Do not prove me so
Yet I am none whose tongue soeer speaks false
Not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
Cut him to pieces
Keep the peace I say
Stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge
Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury
If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
Ill strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime
Or Ill so maul you and your toastingiron
That you shall think the devil is come from hell
What wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge
Second a villain and a murderer
Lord Bigot I am none
Who killd this prince
Tis not an hour since I left him well
I honourd him I loved him and will weep
My date of life out for his sweet lifes loss
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
For villany is not without such rheum
And he long traded in it makes it seem
Like rivers of remorse and innocency
Away with me all you whose souls abhor
The uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse
For I am stifled with this smell of sin
Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there
There tell the king he may inquire us out
Exeunt Lords
Heres a good world Knew you of this fair work
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
Art thou damnd Hubert
Do but hear me sir
Ha Ill tell thee what
Thourt damnd as blacknay nothing is so black
Thou art more deep damnd than Prince Lucifer
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
Upon my soul
If thou didst but consent
And if thou wantst a cord the smallest thread
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
Put but a little water in a spoon
And it shall be as all the ocean
Enough to stifle such a villain up
I do suspect thee very grievously
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay
Let hell want pains enough to torture me
I left him well
Go bear him in thine arms
I am amazed methinks and lose my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world
How easy dost thou take all England up
From forth this morsel of dead royalty
The life the right and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven and England now is left
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
The unowed interest of proudswelling state
Now for the barepickd bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line and vast confusion waits
As doth a raven on a sickfalln beast
The imminent decay of wrested pomp
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest Bear away that child
And follow me with speed Ill to the king
A thousand businesses are brief in hand
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land
Exeunt
Enter KING JOHN CARDINAL PANDULPH and Attendants
Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory
Giving the crown
Take again
From this my hand as holding of the pope
Your sovereign greatness and authority
Now keep your holy word go meet the French
And from his holiness use all your power
To stop their marches fore we are inflamed
Our discontented counties do revolt
Our people quarrel with obedience
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
To stranger blood to foreign royalty
This inundation of mistemperd humour
Rests by you only to be qualified
Then pause not for the present times so sick
That present medicine must be ministerd
Or overthrow incurable ensues
It was my breath that blew this tempest up
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope
But since you are a gentle convertite
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
And make fair weather in your blustering land
On this Ascensionday remember well
Upon your oath of service to the pope
Go I to make the French lay down their arms
Exit
Is this Ascensionday Did not the prophet
Say that before Ascensionday at noon
My crown I should give off Even so I have
I did suppose it should be on constraint
But heaven be thankd it is but voluntary
Enter the BASTARD
All Kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
But Dover castle London hath received
Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers
Your nobles will not hear you but are gone
To offer service to your enemy
And wild amazement hurries up and down
The little number of your doubtful friends
Would not my lords return to me again
After they heard young Arthur was alive
They found him dead and cast into the streets
An empty casket where the jewel of life
By some damnd hand was robbd and taen away
That villain Hubert told me he did live
So on my soul he did for aught he knew
But wherefore do you droop why look you sad
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye
Be stirring as the time be fire with fire
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
Of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
That borrow their behaviors from the great
Grow great by your example and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution
Away and glister like the god of war
When he intendeth to become the field
Show boldness and aspiring confidence
What shall they seek the lion in his den
And fright him there and make him tremble there
O let it not be said forage and run
To meet displeasure farther from the doors
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh
The legate of the pope hath been with me
And I have made a happy peace with him
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
Led by the Dauphin
O inglorious league
Shall we upon the footing of our land
Send fairplay orders and make compromise
Insinuation parley and base truce
To arms invasive shall a beardless boy
A cockerd silken wanton brave our fields
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
Mocking the air with colours idly spread
And find no cheque Let us my liege to arms
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
Or if he do let it at least be said
They saw we had a purpose of defence
Have thou the ordering of this present time
Away then with good courage yet I know
Our party may well meet a prouder foe
Exeunt
Enter in arms LEWIS SALISBURY MELUN PEMBROKE BIGOT and Soldiers
My Lord Melun let this be copied out
And keep it safe for our remembrance
Return the precedent to these lords again
That having our fair order written down
Both they and we perusing oer these notes
May know wherefore we took the sacrament
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable
Upon our sides it never shall be broken
And noble Dauphin albeit we swear
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
To your proceedings yet believe me prince
I am not glad that such a sore of time
Should seek a plaster by contemnd revolt
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
By making many O it grieves my soul
That I must draw this metal from my side
To be a widowmaker O and there
Where honourable rescue and defence
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury
But such is the infection of the time
That for the health and physic of our right
We cannot deal but with the very hand
Of stern injustice and confused wrong
And ist not pity O my grieved friends
That we the sons and children of this isle
Were born to see so sad an hour as this
Wherein we step after a stranger march
Upon her gentle bosom and fill up
Her enemies ranksI must withdraw and weep
Upon the spot of this enforced cause
To grace the gentry of a land remote
And follow unacquainted colours here
What here O nation that thou couldst remove
That Neptunes arms who clippeth thee about
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore
Where these two Christian armies might combine
The blood of malice in a vein of league
And not to spend it so unneighbourly
A noble temper dost thou show in this
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
Doth make an earthquake of nobility
O what a noble combat hast thou fought
Between compulsion and a brave respect
Let me wipe off this honourable dew
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
My heart hath melted at a ladys tears
Being an ordinary inundation
But this effusion of such manly drops
This shower blown up by tempest of the soul
Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
Figured quite oer with burning meteors
Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury
And with a great heart heave away the storm
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
That never saw the giant world enraged
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts
Full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
Come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
Into the purse of rich prosperity
As Lewis himself so nobles shall you all
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine
And even there methinks an angel spake
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
Look where the holy legate comes apace
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
With holy breath
Hail noble prince of France
The next is this King John hath reconciled
Himself to Rome his spirit is come in
That so stood out against the holy church
The great metropolis and see of Rome
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up
And tame the savage spirit of wild war
That like a lion fosterd up at hand
It may lie gently at the foot of peace
And be no further harmful than in show
Your grace shall pardon me I will not back
I am too highborn to be propertied
To be a secondary at control
Or useful servingman and instrument
To any sovereign state throughout the world
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
Between this chastised kingdom and myself
And brought in matter that should feed this fire
And now tis far too huge to be blown out
With that same weak wind which enkindled it
You taught me how to know the face of right
Acquainted me with interest to this land
Yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
And come ye now to tell me John hath made
His peace with Rome What is that peace to me
I by the honour of my marriagebed
After young Arthur claim this land for mine
And now it is halfconquerd must I back
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome
Am I Romes slave What penny hath Rome borne
What men provided what munition sent
That undergo this charge who else but I
And such as to my claim are liable
Sweat in this business and maintain this war
Have I not heard these islanders shout out
Vive le roi as I have bankd their towns
Have I not here the best cards for the game
To win this easy match playd for a crown
And shall I now give oer the yielded set
No no on my soul it never shall be said
You look but on the outside of this work
Outside or inside I will not return
Till my attempt so much be glorified
As to my ample hope was promised
Before I drew this gallant head of war
And culld these fiery spirits from the world
To outlook conquest and to win renown
Even in the jaws of danger and of death
Trumpet sounds
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
Enter the BASTARD attended
According to the fair play of the world
Let me have audience I am sent to speak
My holy lord of Milan from the king
I come to learn how you have dealt for him
And as you answer I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue
The Dauphin is too wilfulopposite
And will not temporize with my entreaties
He flatly says hell not lay down his arms
By all the blood that ever fury breathed
The youth says well Now hear our English king
For thus his royalty doth speak in me
He is prepared and reason too he should
This apish and unmannerly approach
This harnessd masque and unadvised revel
This unhaird sauciness and boyish troops
The king doth smile at and is well prepared
To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
From out the circle of his territories
That hand which had the strength even at your door
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch
To dive like buckets in concealed wells
To crouch in litter of your stable planks
To lie like pawns lockd up in chests and trunks
To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
Even at the crying of your nations crow
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
That in your chambers gave you chastisement
No know the gallant monarch is in arms
And like an eagle oer his aery towers
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest
And you degenerate you ingrate revolts
You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England blush for shame
For your own ladies and palevisaged maids
Like Amazons come tripping after drums
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination
There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
We grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler
Give me leave to speak
No I will speak
We will attend to neither
Strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here
Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
And so shall you being beaten do but start
An echo with the clamour of thy drum
And even at hand a drum is ready braced
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine
Sound but another and another shall
As loud as thine rattle the welkins ear
And mock the deepmouthd thunder for at hand
Not trusting to this halting legate here
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
Is warlike John and in his forehead sits
A bareribbd death whose office is this day
To feast upon whole thousands of the French
Strike up our drums to find this danger out
And thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubt
Exeunt
Alarums Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT
How goes the day with us O tell me Hubert
Badly I fear How fares your majesty
This fever that hath troubled me so long
Lies heavy on me O my heart is sick
Enter a Messenger
My lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge
Desires your majesty to leave the field
And send him word by me which way you go
Tell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there
Be of good comfort for the great supply
That was expected by the Dauphin here
Are wreckd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands
This news was brought to Richard but even now
The French fight coldly and retire themselves
Ay me this tyrant fever burns me up
And will not let me welcome this good news
Set on toward Swinstead to my litter straight
Weakness possesseth me and I am faint
Exeunt
Enter SALISBURY PEMBROKE and BIGOT
I did not think the king so stored with friends
Up once again put spirit in the French
If they miscarry we miscarry too
That misbegotten devil Faulconbridge
In spite of spite alone upholds the day
They say King John sore sick hath left the field
Enter MELUN wounded
Lead me to the revolts of England here
When we were happy we had other names
It is the Count Melun
Wounded to death
Fly noble English you are bought and sold
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
And welcome home again discarded faith
Seek out King John and fall before his feet
For if the French be lords of this loud day
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads thus hath he sworn
And I with him and many moe with me
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love
May this be possible may this be true
Have I not hideous death within my view
Retaining but a quantity of life
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
Resolveth from his figure gainst the fire
What in the world should make me now deceive
Since I must lose the use of all deceit
Why should I then be false since it is true
That I must die here and live hence by truth
I say again if Lewis do win the day
He is forsworn if eer those eyes of yours
Behold another day break in the east
But even this night whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old feeble and daywearied sun
Even this ill night your breathing shall expire
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
If Lewis by your assistance win the day
Commend me to one Hubert with your king
The love of him and this respect besides
For that my grandsire was an Englishman
Awakes my conscience to confess all this
In lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence
From forth the noise and rumour of the field
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires
We do believe thee and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favour and the form
Of this most fair occasion by the which
We will untread the steps of damned flight
And like a bated and retired flood
Leaving our rankness and irregular course
Stoop low within those bounds we have oerlookd
And cabby run on in obedience
Even to our ocean to our great King John
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye Away my friends New flight
And happy newness that intends old right
Exeunt leading off MELUN
Enter LEWIS and his train
The sun of heaven methought was loath to set
But stayd and made the western welkin blush
When English measure backward their own ground
In faint retire O bravely came we off
When with a volley of our needless shot
After such bloody toil we bid good night
And wound our tattering colours clearly up
Last in the field and almost lords of it
Enter a Messenger
Where is my prince the Dauphin
Here what news
The Count Melun is slain the English lords
By his persuasion are again falln off
And your supply which you have wishd so long
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands
Ah foul shrewd news beshrew thy very heart
I did not think to be so sad tonight
As this hath made me Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary powers
Whoever spoke it it is true my lord
Well keep good quarter and good care tonight
The day shall not be up so soon as I
To try the fair adventure of tomorrow
Exeunt
Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT severally
Whos there speak ho speak quickly or I shoot
A friend What art thou
Of the part of England
Whither dost thou go
Whats that to thee why may not I demand
Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine
Hubert I think
Thou hast a perfect thought
I will upon all hazards well believe
Thou art my friend that knowst my tongue so well
Who art thou
Who thou wilt and if thou please
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
I come one way of the Plantagenets
Unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night
Have done me shame brave soldier pardon me
That any accent breaking from thy tongue
Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear
Come come sans compliment what news abroad
Why here walk I in the black brow of night
To find you out
Brief then and whats the news
O my sweet sir news fitting to the night
Black fearful comfortless and horrible
Show me the very wound of this ill news
I am no woman Ill not swoon at it
The king I fear is poisond by a monk
I left him almost speechless and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil that you might
The better arm you to the sudden time
Than if you had at leisure known of this
How did he take it who did taste to him
A monk I tell you a resolved villain
Whose bowels suddenly burst out the king
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover
Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty
Why know you not the lords are all come back
And brought Prince Henry in their company
At whose request the king hath pardond them
And they are all about his majesty
Withhold thine indignation mighty heaven
And tempt us not to bear above our power
Ill tell tree Hubert half my power this night
Passing these flats are taken by the tide
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them
Myself well mounted hardly have escaped
Away before conduct me to the king
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come
Exeunt
Enter PRINCE HENRY SALISBURY and BIGOT
It is too late the life of all his blood
Is touchd corruptibly and his pure brain
Which some suppose the souls frail dwellinghouse
Doth by the idle comments that it makes
Foretell the ending of mortality
Enter PEMBROKE
His highness yet doth speak and holds belief
That being brought into the open air
It would allay the burning quality
Of that fell poison which assaileth him
Let him be brought into the orchard here
Doth he still rage
Exit BIGOT
He is more patient
Than when you left him even now he sung
O vanity of sickness fierce extremes
In their continuance will not feel themselves
Death having preyd upon the outward parts
Leaves them invisible and his siege is now
Against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
With many legions of strange fantasies
Whi ch in their throng and press to that last hold
Confound themselves Tis strange that death
should sing
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
And from the organpipe of frailty sings
His soul and body to their lasting rest
Be of good comfort prince for you are born
To set a form upon that indigest
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
Enter Attendants and BIGOT carrying KING JOHN in a chair
Ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom
It would not out at windows nor at doors
There is so hot a summer in my bosom
That all my bowels crumble up to dust
I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
Upon a parchment and against this fire
Do I shrink up
How fares your majesty
Poisondill faredead forsook cast off
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw
Nor let my kingdoms rivers take their course
Through my burnd bosom nor entreat the north
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
And comfort me with cold I do not ask you much
I beg cold comfort and you are so strait
And so ingrateful you deny me that
O that there were some virtue in my tears
That might relieve you
The salt in them is hot
Within me is a hell and there the poison
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
On unreprievable condemned blood
Enter the BASTARD
O I am scalded with my violent motion
And spleen of speed to see your majesty
O cousin thou art come to set mine eye
The tackle of my heart is crackd and burnd
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
Are turned to one thread one little hair
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by
Which holds but till thy news be uttered
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him
For in a night the best part of my power
As I upon advantage did remove
Were in the Washes all unwarily
Devoured by the unexpected flood
KING JOHN dies
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
My liege my lord but now a king now thus
Even so must I run on and even so stop
What surety of the world what hope what stay
When this was now a king and now is clay
Art thou gone so I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
As it on earth hath been thy servant still
Now now you stars that move in your right spheres
Where be your powers show now your mended faiths
And instantly return with me again
To push destruction and perpetual shame
Out of the weak door of our fainting land
Straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
The Dauphin rages at our very heels
It seems you know not then so much as we
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin
And brings from him such offers of our peace
As we with honour and respect may take
With purpose presently to leave this war
He will the rather do it when he sees
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence
Nay it is in a manner done already
For many carriages he hath dispatchd
To the seaside and put his cause and quarrel
To the disposing of the cardinal
With whom yourself myself and other lords
If you think meet this afternoon will post
To consummate this business happily
Let it be so and you my noble prince
With other princes that may best be spared
Shall wait upon your fathers funeral
At Worcester must his body be interrd
For so he willd it
Thither shall it then
And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land
To whom with all submission on my knee
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly
And the like tender of our love we make
To rest without a spot for evermore
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
And knows not how to do it but with tears
O let us pay the time but needful woe
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
This England never did nor never shall
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
But when it first did help to wound itself
Now these her princes are come home again
Come the three corners of the world in arms
And we shall shock them Nought shall make us rue
If England to itself do rest but true
Exeunt
Enter FLAVIUS MARULLUS and certain Commoners
Hence home you idle creatures get you home
Is this a holiday what know you not
Being mechanical you ought not walk
Upon a labouring day without the sign
Of your profession Speak what trade art thou
Why sir a carpenter
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
What dost thou with thy best apparel on
You sir what trade are you
Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but
as you would say a cobbler
But what trade art thou answer me directly
A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe
conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
What trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade
Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet
if you be out sir I can mend you
What meanest thou by that mend me thou saucy fellow
Why sir cobble you
Thou art a cobbler art thou
Truly sir all that I live by is with the awl I
meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens
matters but with awl I am indeed sir a surgeon
to old shoes when they are in great danger I
recover them As proper men as ever trod upon
neats leather have gone upon my handiwork
But wherefore art not in thy shop today
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
into more work But indeed sir we make holiday
to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariotwheels
You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
Have you climbd up to walls and battlements
To towers and windows yea to chimneytops
Your infants in your arms and there have sat
The livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
And when you saw his chariot but appear
Have you not made an universal shout
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores
And do you now put on your best attire
And do you now cull out a holiday
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompeys blood Be gone
Run to your houses fall upon your knees
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude
Go go good countrymen and for this fault
Assemble all the poor men of your sort
Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
Into the channel till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all
Exeunt all the Commoners
See whether their basest metal be not moved
They vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
Go you down that way towards the Capitol
This way will I disrobe the images
If you do find them deckd with ceremonies
May we do so
You know it is the feast of Lupercal
It is no matter let no images
Be hung with Caesars trophies Ill about
And drive away the vulgar from the streets
So do you too where you perceive them thick
These growing feathers pluckd from Caesars wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness
Exeunt
Flourish Enter CAESAR ANTONY for the course  CALPURNIA PORTIA DECIUS BRUTUS CICERO BRUTUS  CASSIUS and CASCA a great crowd following among them a Soothsayer
Calpurnia
Peace ho Caesar speaks
Calpurnia
Here my lord
Stand you directly in Antonius way
When he doth run his course Antonius
Caesar my lord
Forget not in your speed Antonius
To touch Calpurnia for our elders say
The barren touched in this holy chase
Shake off their sterile curse
I shall remember
When Caesar says do this it is performd
Set on and leave no ceremony out
Flourish
Caesar
Ha who calls
Bid every noise be still peace yet again
Who is it in the press that calls on me
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turnd to hear
Beware the ides of March
What man is that
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March
Set him before me let me see his face
Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar
What sayst thou to me now speak once again
Beware the ides of March
He is a dreamer let us leave him pass
Sennet Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS
Will you go see the order of the course
Not I
I pray you do
I am not gamesome I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
Let me not hinder Cassius your desires
Ill leave you
Brutus I do observe you now of late
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you
Cassius
Be not deceived if I have veild my look
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference
Conceptions only proper to myself
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
Among which number Cassius be you one
Nor construe any further my neglect
Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
Forgets the shows of love to other men
Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
No Cassius for the eye sees not itself
But by reflection by some other things
Tis just
And it is very much lamented Brutus
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye
That you might see your shadow I have heard
Where many of the best respect in Rome
Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this ages yoke
Have wishd that noble Brutus had his eyes
Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me
Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection I your glass
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of
And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
Were I a common laugher or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout then hold me dangerous
Flourish and shout
What means this shouting I do fear the people
Choose Caesar for their king
Ay do you fear it
Then must I think you would not have it so
I would not Cassius yet I love him well
But wherefore do you hold me here so long
What is it that you would impart to me
If it be aught toward the general good
Set honour in one eye and death i the other
And I will look on both indifferently
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honour more than I fear death
I know that virtue to be in you Brutus
As well as I do know your outward favour
Well honour is the subject of my story
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life but for my single self
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself
I was born free as Caesar so were you
We both have fed as well and we can both
Endure the winters cold as well as he
For once upon a raw and gusty day
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
Caesar said to me Darest thou Cassius now
Leap in with me into this angry flood
And swim to yonder point Upon the word
Accoutred as I was I plunged in
And bade him follow so indeed he did
The torrent roard and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy
But ere we could arrive the point proposed
Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink
I as Aeneas our great ancestor
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar And this man
Is now become a god and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
He had a fever when he was in Spain
And when the fit was on him I did mark
How he did shake tis true this god did shake
His coward lips did from their colour fly
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his lustre I did hear him groan
Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books
Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius
As a sick girl Ye gods it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone
Shout Flourish
Another general shout
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honours that are heapd on Caesar
Why man he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves
Men at some time are masters of their fates
The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
But in ourselves that we are underlings
Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar
Why should that name be sounded more than yours
Write them together yours is as fair a name
Sound them it doth become the mouth as well
Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar
Now in the names of all the gods at once
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed
Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
When went there by an age since the great flood
But it was famed with more than with one man
When could they say till now that talkd of Rome
That her wide walls encompassd but one man
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough
When there is in it but one only man
O you and I have heard our fathers say
There was a Brutus once that would have brookd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king
That you do love me I am nothing jealous
What you would work me to I have some aim
How I have thought of this and of these times
I shall recount hereafter for this present
I would not so with love I might entreat you
Be any further moved What you have said
I will consider what you have to say
I will with patience hear and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things
Till then my noble friend chew upon this
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us
I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus
The games are done and Caesar is returning
As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
And he will after his sour fashion tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note today
Reenter CAESAR and his Train
I will do so But look you Cassius
The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow
And all the rest look like a chidden train
Calpurnias cheek is pale and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol
Being crossd in conference by some senators
Casca will tell us what the matter is
Antonius
Caesar
Let me have men about me that are fat
Sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
He thinks too much such men are dangerous
Fear him not Caesar hes not dangerous
He is a noble Roman and well given
Would he were fatter But I fear him not
Yet if my name were liable to fear
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
As thou dost Antony he hears no music
Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
As if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing
Such men as he be never at hearts ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves
And therefore are they very dangerous
I rather tell thee what is to be feard
Than what I fear for always I am Caesar
Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
And tell me truly what thou thinkst of him
Sennet Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train but CASCA
You pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me
Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced today
That Caesar looks so sad
Why you were with him were you not
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced
Why there was a crown offered him and being
offered him he put it by with the back of his hand
thus and then the people fell ashouting
What was the second noise for
Why for that too
They shouted thrice what was the last cry for
Why for that too
Was the crown offered him thrice
Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every
time gentler than other and at every puttingby
mine honest neighbours shouted
Who offered him the crown
Why Antony
Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it
it was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crownyet twas not a crown
neither twas one of these coronetsand as I told
you he put it by once but for all that to my
thinking he would fain have had it Then he
offered it to him again then he put it by again
but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it And then he offered it the third
time he put it the third time by and still as he
refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and
for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air
But soft I pray you what did Caesar swound
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at
mouth and was speechless
Tis very like he hath the failing sickness
No Caesar hath it not but you and I
And honest Casca we have the falling sickness
I know not what you mean by that but I am sure
Caesar fell down If the tagrag people did not
clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and
displeased them as they use to do the players in
the theatre I am no true man
What said he when he came unto himself
Marry before he fell down when he perceived the
common herd was glad he refused the crown he
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut An I had been a man of any
occupation if I would not have taken him at a word
I would I might go to hell among the rogues And so
he fell When he came to himself again he said
If he had done or said any thing amiss he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity Three
or four wenches where I stood cried Alas good
soul and forgave him with all their hearts but
theres no heed to be taken of them if Caesar had
stabbed their mothers they would have done no less
And after that he came thus sad away
Ay
Did Cicero say any thing
Ay he spoke Greek
To what effect
Nay an I tell you that Ill neer look you i the
face again but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads but for mine own
part it was Greek to me I could tell you more
news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs
off Caesars images are put to silence Fare you
well There was more foolery yet if I could
remember it
Will you sup with me tonight Casca
No I am promised forth
Will you dine with me tomorrow
Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth the eating
Good I will expect you
Do so Farewell both
Exit
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
He was quick mettle when he went to school
So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise
However he puts on this tardy form
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite
And so it is For this time I will leave you
Tomorrow if you please to speak with me
I will come home to you or if you will
Come home to me and I will wait for you
I will do so till then think of the world
Exit BRUTUS
Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see
Thy honourable metal may be wrought
From that it is disposed therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes
For who so firm that cannot be seduced
Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
He should not humour me I will this night
In several hands in at his windows throw
As if they came from several citizens
Writings all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
Caesars ambition shall be glanced at
And after this let Caesar seat him sure
For we will shake him or worse days endure
Exit
Thunder and lightning Enter from opposite sides CASCA with his sword drawn and CICERO
Good even Casca brought you Caesar home
Why are you breathless and why stare you so
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
To be exalted with the threatening clouds
But never till tonight never till now
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire
Either there is a civil strife in heaven
Or else the world too saucy with the gods
Incenses them to send destruction
Why saw you any thing more wonderful
A common slaveyou know him well by sight
Held up his left hand which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches joind and yet his hand
Not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd
BesidesI ha not since put up my sword
Against the Capitol I met a lion
Who glared upon me and went surly by
Without annoying me and there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
Transformed with their fear who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noonday upon the marketplace
Hooting and shrieking When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet let not men say
These are their reasons they are natural
For I believe they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon
Indeed it is a strangedisposed time
But men may construe things after their fashion
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
Come Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
He doth for he did bid Antonius
Send word to you he would be there tomorrow
Good night then Casca this disturbed sky
Is not to walk in
Farewell Cicero
Exit CICERO
Enter CASSIUS
Whos there
A Roman
Casca by your voice
Your ear is good Cassius what night is this
A very pleasing night to honest men
Who ever knew the heavens menace so
Those that have known the earth so full of faults
For my part I have walkd about the streets
Submitting me unto the perilous night
And thus unbraced Casca as you see
Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
And when the cross blue lightning seemd to open
The breast of heaven I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
It is the part of men to fear and tremble
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us
You are dull Casca and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want
Or else you use not You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
To see the strange impatience of the heavens
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind
Why old men fool and children calculate
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous qualitywhy you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state
Now could I Casca name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night
That thunders lightens opens graves and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol
A man no mightier than thyself or me
And fearful as these strange eruptions are
Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius
Let it be who it is for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
But woe the while our fathers minds are dead
And we are governd with our mothers spirits
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
In every place save here in Italy
I know where I will wear this dagger then
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit
But life being weary of these worldly bars
Never lacks power to dismiss itself
If I know this know all the world besides
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure
Thunder still
So can I
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man I know he would not be a wolf
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
He were no lion were not Romans hinds
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws what trash is Rome
What rubbish and what offal when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief
Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman then I know
My answer must be made But I am armd
And dangers are to me indifferent
You speak to Casca and to such a man
That is no fleering telltale Hold my hand
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest
Theres a bargain made
Now know you Casca I have moved already
Some certain of the noblestminded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honourabledangerous consequence
And I do know by this they stay for me
In Pompeys porch for now this fearful night
There is no stir or walking in the streets
And the complexion of the element
In favours like the work we have in hand
Most bloody fiery and most terrible
Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait
He is a friend
Enter CINNA
Cinna where haste you so
To find out you Whos that Metellus Cimber
No it is Casca one incorporate
To our attempts Am I not stayd for Cinna
I am glad on t What a fearful night is this
Theres two or three of us have seen strange sights
Am I not stayd for tell me
Yes you are
O Cassius if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party
Be you content good Cinna take this paper
And look you lay it in the praetors chair
Where Brutus may but find it and throw this
In at his window set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus statue all this done
Repair to Pompeys porch where you shall find us
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
All but Metellus Cimber and hes gone
To seek you at your house Well I will hie
And so bestow these papers as you bade me
That done repair to Pompeys theatre
Exit CINNA
Come Casca you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house three parts of him
Is ours already and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours
O he sits high in all the peoples hearts
And that which would appear offence in us
His countenance like richest alchemy
Will change to virtue and to worthiness
Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited Let us go
For it is after midnight and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him
Exeunt
Enter BRUTUS
What Lucius ho
I cannot by the progress of the stars
Give guess how near to day Lucius I say
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
When Lucius when awake I say what Lucius
Enter LUCIUS
Calld you my lord
Get me a taper in my study Lucius
When it is lighted come and call me here
I will my lord
Exit
It must be by his death and for my part
I know no personal cause to spurn at him
But for the general He would be crownd
How that might change his nature theres the question
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
And that craves wary walking Crown himthat
And then I grant we put a sting in him
That at his will he may do danger with
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar
I have not known when his affections swayd
More than his reason But tis a common proof
That lowliness is young ambitions ladder
Whereto the climberupward turns his face
But when he once attains the upmost round
He then unto the ladder turns his back
Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend So Caesar may
Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
Will bear no colour for the thing he is
Fashion it thus that what he is augmented
Would run to these and these extremities
And therefore think him as a serpents egg
Which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous
And kill him in the shell
Reenter LUCIUS
The taper burneth in your closet sir
Searching the window for a flint I found
This paper thus seald up and I am sure
It did not lie there when I went to bed
Gives him the letter
Get you to bed again it is not day
Is not tomorrow boy the ides of March
I know not sir
Look in the calendar and bring me word
I will sir
Exit
The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them
Opens the letter and reads
Brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself
Shall Rome  and c Speak strike redress
Brutus thou sleepst awake
Such instigations have been often droppd
Where I have took them up
Shall Rome  and c Thus must I piece it out
Shall Rome stand under one mans awe What Rome
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive when he was calld a king
Speak strike redress Am I entreated
To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
If the redress will follow thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus
Reenter LUCIUS
Sir March is wasted fourteen days
Knocking within
Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks
Exit LUCIUS
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
I have not slept
And the first motion all the interim is
Like a phantasma or a hideous dream
The Genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council and the state of man
Like to a little kingdom suffers then
The nature of an insurrection
Reenter LUCIUS
Sir tis your brother Cassius at the door
Who doth desire to see you
Is he alone
No sir there are moe with him
Do you know them
No sir their hats are pluckd about their ears
And half their faces buried in their cloaks
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favour
Let em enter
Exit LUCIUS
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
When evils are most free O then by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracy
Hide it in smiles and affability
For if thou path thy native semblance on
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention
Enter the conspirators CASSIUS CASCA DECIUS BRUTUS CINNA METELLUS CIMBER and TREBONIUS
I think we are too bold upon your rest
Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you
I have been up this hour awake all night
Know I these men that come along with you
Yes every man of them and no man here
But honours you and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you
This is Trebonius
He is welcome hither
This Decius Brutus
He is welcome too
This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
They are all welcome
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night
Shall I entreat a word
BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper
Here lies the east doth not the day break here
No
O pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day
You shall confess that you are both deceived
Here as I point my sword the sun arises
Which is a great way growing on the south
Weighing the youthful season of the year
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire and the high east
Stands as the Capitol directly here
Give me your hands all over one by one
And let us swear our resolution
No not an oath if not the face of men
The sufferance of our souls the times abuse
If these be motives weak break off betimes
And every man hence to his idle bed
So let highsighted tyranny range on
Till each man drop by lottery But if these
As I am sure they do bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
The melting spirits of women then countrymen
What need we any spur but our own cause
To prick us to redress what other bond
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
And will not palter and what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged
That this shall be or we will fall for it
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears and nobly bears
Is guilty of a several bastardy
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath passd from him
But what of Cicero shall we sound him
I think he will stand very strong with us
Let us not leave him out
No by no means
O let us have him for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion
And buy mens voices to commend our deeds
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
But all be buried in his gravity
O name him not let us not break with him
For he will never follow any thing
That other men begin
Then leave him out
Indeed he is not fit
Shall no man else be touchd but only Caesar
Decius well urged I think it is not meet
Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar
Should outlive Caesar we shall find of him
A shrewd contriver and you know his means
If he improve them may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all which to prevent
Let Antony and Caesar fall together
Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar
And in the spirit of men there is no blood
O that we then could come by Caesars spirit
And not dismember Caesar But alas
Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends
Lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully
Lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
And let our hearts as subtle masters do
And after seem to chide em This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious
Which so appearing to the common eyes
We shall be calld purgers not murderers
And for Mark Antony think not of him
For he can do no more than Caesars arm
When Caesars head is off
Yet I fear him
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar
Alas good Cassius do not think of him
If he love Caesar all that he can do
Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar
And that were much he should for he is given
To sports to wildness and much company
There is no fear in him let him not die
For he will live and laugh at this hereafter
Clock strikes
Peace count the clock
The clock hath stricken three
Tis time to part
But it is doubtful yet
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no
For he is superstitious grown of late
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
It may be these apparent prodigies
The unaccustomd terror of this night
And the persuasion of his augurers
May hold him from the Capitol today
Never fear that if he be so resolved
I can oersway him for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betrayd with trees
And bears with glasses elephants with holes
Lions with toils and men with flatterers
But when I tell him he hates flatterers
He says he does being then most flattered
Let me work
For I can give his humour the true bent
And I will bring him to the Capitol
Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
By the eighth hour is that the uttermost
Be that the uttermost and fail not then
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder none of you have thought of him
Now good Metellus go along by him
He loves me well and I have given him reasons
Send him but hither and Ill fashion him
The morning comes upon s well leave you Brutus
And friends disperse yourselves but all remember
What you have said and show yourselves true Romans
Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
Let not our looks put on our purposes
With untired spirits and formal constancy
And so good morrow to you every one
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter
Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
Which busy care draws in the brains of men
Therefore thou sleepst so sound
Enter PORTIA
Brutus my lord
Portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning
Nor for yours neither Youve ungently Brutus
Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
You suddenly arose and walkd about
Musing and sighing with your arms across
And when I askd you what the matter was
You stared upon me with ungentle looks
I urged you further then you scratchd your head
And too impatiently stampd with your foot
Yet I insisted yet you answerd not
But with an angry wafture of your hand
Gave sign for me to leave you so I did
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seemd too much enkindled and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humour
Which sometime hath his hour with every man
It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevaild on your condition
I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief
I am not well in health and that is all
Brutus is wise and were he not in health
He would embrace the means to come by it
Why so I do Good Portia go to bed
Is Brutus sick and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness No my Brutus
You have some sick offence within your mind
Which by the right and virtue of my place
I ought to know of and upon my knees
I charm you by my oncecommended beauty
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one
That you unfold to me yourself your half
Why you are heavy and what men tonight
Have had to resort to you for here have been
Some six or seven who did hide their faces
Even from darkness
Kneel not gentle Portia
I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you Am I yourself
But as it were in sort or limitation
To keep with you at meals comfort your bed
And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure If it be no more
Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife
You are my true and honourable wife
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart
If this were true then should I know this secret
I grant I am a woman but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
I grant I am a woman but withal
A woman wellreputed Catos daughter
Think you I am no stronger than my sex
Being so fatherd and so husbanded
Tell me your counsels I will not disclose em
I have made strong proof of my constancy
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here in the thigh can I bear that with patience
And not my husbands secrets
O ye gods
Render me worthy of this noble wife
Knocking within
Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart
All my engagements I will construe to thee
Leave me with haste
Exit PORTIA
Lucius whos that knocks
Reenter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS
He is a sick man that would speak with you
Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of
Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
O what a time have you chose out brave Caius
To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
Any exploit worthy the name of honour
Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it
By all the gods that Romans bow before
I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome
Brave son derived from honourable loins
Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
My mortified spirit Now bid me run
And I will strive with things impossible
Yea get the better of them Whats to do
A piece of work that will make sick men whole
But are not some whole that we must make sick
That must we also What it is my Caius
I shall unfold to thee as we are going
To whom it must be done
Set on your foot
And with a heart newfired I follow you
To do I know not what but it sufficeth
That Brutus leads me on
Follow me then
Exeunt
Thunder and lightning Enter CAESAR in his nightgown
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out
Help ho they murder Caesar Whos within
Enter a Servant
My lord
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success
I will my lord
Exit
Enter CALPURNIA
What mean you Caesar think you to walk forth
You shall not stir out of your house today
Caesar shall forth the things that threatend me
Neer lookd but on my back when they shall see
The face of Caesar they are vanished
Caesar I never stood on ceremonies
Yet now they fright me There is one within
Besides the things that we have heard and seen
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
A lioness hath whelped in the streets
And graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
The noise of battle hurtled in the air
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
O Caesar these things are beyond all use
And I do fear them
What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar
When beggars die there are no comets seen
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
Cowards die many times before their deaths
The valiant never taste of death but once
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard
It seems to me most strange that men should fear
Seeing that death a necessary end
Will come when it will come
Reenter Servant
What say the augurers
They would not have you to stir forth today
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
They could not find a heart within the beast
The gods do this in shame of cowardice
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
If he should stay at home today for fear
No Caesar shall not danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he
We are two lions litterd in one day
And I the elder and more terrible
And Caesar shall go forth
Alas my lord
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
Do not go forth today call it my fear
That keeps you in the house and not your own
Well send Mark Antony to the senatehouse
And he shall say you are not well today
Let me upon my knee prevail in this
Mark Antony shall say I am not well
And for thy humour I will stay at home
Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
Heres Decius Brutus he shall tell them so
Caesar all hail good morrow worthy Caesar
I come to fetch you to the senatehouse
And you are come in very happy time
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come today
Cannot is false and that I dare not falser
I will not come today tell them so Decius
Say he is sick
Shall Caesar send a lie
Have I in conquest stretchd mine arm so far
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
Decius go tell them Caesar will not come
Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause
Lest I be laughd at when I tell them so
The cause is in my will I will not come
That is enough to satisfy the senate
Because I love you I will let you know
Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
She dreamt tonight she saw my statua
Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans
Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
And these does she apply for warnings and portents
And evils imminent and on her knee
Hath beggd that I will stay at home today
This dream is all amiss interpreted
It was a vision fair and fortunate
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes
In which so many smiling Romans bathed
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood and that great men shall press
For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
This by Calpurnias dream is signified
And this way have you well expounded it
I have when you have heard what I can say
And know it now the senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
If you shall send them word you will not come
Their minds may change Besides it were a mock
Apt to be renderd for some one to say
Break up the senate till another time
When Caesars wife shall meet with better dreams
If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
Lo Caesar is afraid
Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
To our proceeding bids me tell you this
And reason to my love is liable
How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia
I am ashamed I did yield to them
Give me my robe for I will go
Enter PUBLIUS BRUTUS LIGARIUS METELLUS CASCA TREBONIUS and CINNA
And look where Publius is come to fetch me
Good morrow Caesar
Welcome Publius
What Brutus are you stirrd so early too
Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius
Caesar was neer so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean
What is t oclock
Caesar tis strucken eight
I thank you for your pains and courtesy
Enter ANTONY
See Antony that revels long o nights
Is notwithstanding up Good morrow Antony
So to most noble Caesar
Bid them prepare within
I am to blame to be thus waited for
Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius
I have an hours talk in store for you
Remember that you call on me today
Be near me that I may remember you
Caesar I will
Aside
and so near will I be
That your best friends shall wish I had been further
Good friends go in and taste some wine with me
And we like friends will straightway go together
Aside  That every like is not the same O Caesar
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon
Exeunt
Enter ARTEMIDORUS reading a paper
Caesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius
come not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not
Trebonius mark well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus
loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius
There is but one mind in all these men and it is
bent against Caesar If thou beest not immortal
look about you security gives way to conspiracy
The mighty gods defend thee Thy lover
ARTEMIDORUS
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along
And as a suitor will I give him this
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation
If thou read this O Caesar thou mayst live
If not the Fates with traitors do contrive
Exit
Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS
I prithee boy run to the senatehouse
Stay not to answer me but get thee gone
Why dost thou stay
To know my errand madam
I would have had thee there and here again
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
O constancy be strong upon my side
Set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue
I have a mans mind but a womans might
How hard it is for women to keep counsel
Art thou here yet
Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And so return to you and nothing else
Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well
For he went sickly forth and take good note
What Caesar doth what suitors press to him
Hark boy what noise is that
I hear none madam
Prithee listen well
I heard a bustling rumour like a fray
And the wind brings it from the Capitol
Sooth madam I hear nothing
Enter the Soothsayer
Come hither fellow which way hast thou been
At mine own house good lady
What ist oclock
About the ninth hour lady
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol
Madam not yet I go to take my stand
To see him pass on to the Capitol
Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not
That I have lady if it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me
I shall beseech him to befriend himself
Why knowst thou any harms intended towards him
None that I know will be much that I fear may chance
Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels
Of senators of praetors common suitors
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
Ill get me to a place more void and there
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along
Exit
I must go in Ay me how weak a thing
The heart of woman is O Brutus
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise
Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint
Run Lucius and commend me to my lord
Say I am merry come to me again
And bring me word what he doth say to thee
Exeunt severally
A crowd of people among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer Flourish Enter CAESAR BRUTUS  CASSIUS CASCA DECIUS BRUTUS METELLUS CIMBER  TREBONIUS CINNA ANTONY LEPIDUS POPILIUS PUBLIUS and others
To the Soothsayer  The ides of March are come
Ay Caesar but not gone
Hail Caesar read this schedule
Trebonius doth desire you to oerread
At your best leisure this his humble suit
O Caesar read mine first for mines a suit
That touches Caesar nearer read it great Caesar
What touches us ourself shall be last served
Delay not Caesar read it instantly
What is the fellow mad
Sirrah give place
What urge you your petitions in the street
Come to the Capitol
CAESAR goes up to the SenateHouse the rest following
I wish your enterprise today may thrive
What enterprise Popilius
Fare you well
Advances to CAESAR
What said Popilius Lena
He wishd today our enterprise might thrive
I fear our purpose is discovered
Look how he makes to Caesar mark him
Casca be sudden for we fear prevention
Brutus what shall be done If this be known
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back
For I will slay myself
Cassius be constant
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes
For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change
Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus
He draws Mark Antony out of the way
Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS
Where is Metellus Cimber Let him go
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar
He is addressd press near and second him
Casca you are the first that rears your hand
Are we all ready What is now amiss
That Caesar and his senate must redress
Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart
Kneeling
I must prevent thee Cimber
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men
And turn preordinance and first decree
Into the law of children Be not fond
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thawd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words
Lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning
Thy brother by decree is banished
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way
Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
Will he be satisfied
Is there no voice more worthy than my own
To sound more sweetly in great Caesars ear
For the repealing of my banishd brother
I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal
What Brutus
Pardon Caesar Caesar pardon
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber
I could be well moved if I were as you
If I could pray to move prayers would move me
But I am constant as the northern star
Of whose truefixd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament
The skies are painted with unnumberd sparks
They are all fire and every one doth shine
But theres but one in all doth hold his place
So in the world tis furnishd well with men
And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank
Unshaked of motion and that I am he
Let me a little show it even in this
That I was constant Cimber should be banishd
And constant do remain to keep him so
O Caesar
Hence wilt thou lift up Olympus
Great Caesar
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel
Speak hands for me
CASCA first then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR
Et tu Brute Then fall Caesar
Dies
Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead
Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
Some to the common pulpits and cry out
Liberty freedom and enfranchisement
People and senators be not affrighted
Fly not stand stiff ambitions debt is paid
Go to the pulpit Brutus
And Cassius too
Wheres Publius
Here quite confounded with this mutiny
Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesars
Should chance
Talk not of standing Publius good cheer
There is no harm intended to your person
Nor to no Roman else so tell them Publius
And leave us Publius lest that the people
Rushing on us should do your age some mischief
Do so and let no man abide this deed
But we the doers
Reenter TREBONIUS
Where is Antony
Fled to his house amazed
Men wives and children stare cry out and run
As it were doomsday
Fates we will know your pleasures
That we shall die we know tis but the time
And drawing days out that men stand upon
Why he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death
Grant that and then is death a benefit
So are we Caesars friends that have abridged
His time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop
And let us bathe our hands in Caesars blood
Up to the elbows and besmear our swords
Then walk we forth even to the marketplace
And waving our red weapons oer our heads
Lets all cry Peace freedom and liberty
Stoop then and wash How many ages hence
In states unborn and accents yet unknown
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
That now on Pompeys basis lies along
No worthier than the dust
So oft as that shall be
So often shall the knot of us be calld
The men that gave their country liberty
What shall we forth
Ay every man away
Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome
Enter a Servant
Soft who comes here A friend of Antonys
Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
And being prostrate thus he bade me say
Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
Say I love Brutus and I honour him
Say I feard Caesar honourd him and loved him
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him and be resolved
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
So well as Brutus living but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith So says my master Antony
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
I never thought him worse
Tell him so please him come unto this place
He shall be satisfied and by my honour
Depart untouchd
Ill fetch him presently
Exit
I know that we shall have him well to friend
I wish we may but yet have I a mind
That fears him much and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose
But here comes Antony
Reenter ANTONY
Welcome Mark Antony
O mighty Caesar dost thou lie so low
Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well
I know not gentlemen what you intend
Who else must be let blood who else is rank
If I myself there is no hour so fit
As Caesars death hour nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world
I do beseech ye if you bear me hard
Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
Fulfil your pleasure Live a thousand years
I shall not find myself so apt to die
No place will please me so no mean of death
As here by Caesar and by you cut off
The choice and master spirits of this age
O Antony beg not your death of us
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel
You see we do yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done
Our hearts you see not they are pitiful
And pity to the general wrong of Rome
As fire drives out fire so pity pity
Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part
To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
Of brothers temper do receive you in
With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
Your voice shall be as strong as any mans
In the disposing of new dignities
Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude beside themselves with fear
And then we will deliver you the cause
Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him
Have thus proceeded
I doubt not of your wisdom
Let each man render me his bloody hand
First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you
Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand
Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus
Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours
Though last not last in love yours good Trebonius
Gentlemen allalas what shall I say
My credit now stands on such slippery ground
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me
Either a coward or a flatterer
That I did love thee Caesar O tis true
If then thy spirit look upon us now
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
Most noble in the presence of thy corse
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies
Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bayd brave hart
Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
Signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe
O world thou wast the forest to this hart
And this indeed O world the heart of thee
How like a deer strucken by many princes
Dost thou here lie
Mark Antony
Pardon me Caius Cassius
The enemies of Caesar shall say this
Then in a friend it is cold modesty
I blame you not for praising Caesar so
Will you be prickd in number of our friends
Or shall we on and not depend on you
Therefore I took your hands but was indeed
Swayd from the point by looking down on Caesar
Friends am I with you all and love you all
Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous
Or else were this a savage spectacle
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you Antony the son of Caesar
You should be satisfied
Thats all I seek
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the marketplace
And in the pulpit as becomes a friend
Speak in the order of his funeral
You shall Mark Antony
Brutus a word with you
Aside to BRUTUS
You know not what you do do not consent
That Antony speak in his funeral
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter
By your pardon
I will myself into the pulpit first
And show the reason of our Caesars death
What Antony shall speak I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
It shall advantage more than do us wrong
I know not what may fall I like it not
Mark Antony here take you Caesars body
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar
And say you dot by our permission
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral and you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going
After my speech is ended
Be it so
I do desire no more
Prepare the body then and follow us
Exeunt all but ANTONY
O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarterd with the hands of war
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
And Caesars spirit ranging for revenge
With Ate by his side come hot from hell
Shall in these confines with a monarchs voice
Cry  Havoc and let slip the dogs of war
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men groaning for burial
Enter a Servant
You serve Octavius Caesar do you not
I do Mark Antony
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
He did receive his letters and is coming
And bid me say to you by word of mouth
O Caesar
Seeing the body
Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
Passion I see is catching for mine eyes
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
Began to water Is thy master coming
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet
Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the marketplace there shall I try
In my oration how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men
According to the which thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things
Lend me your hand
Exeunt with CAESARs body
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS and a throng of Citizens
We will be satisfied let us be satisfied
Then follow me and give me audience friends
Cassius go you into the other street
And part the numbers
Those that will hear me speak let em stay here
Those that will follow Cassius go with him
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesars death
I will hear Brutus speak
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons
When severally we hear them rendered
Exit CASSIUS with some of the Citizens BRUTUS goes into the pulpit
The noble Brutus is ascended silence
Be patient till the last
Romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my
cause and be silent that you may hear believe me
for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that
you may believe censure me in your wisdom and
awake your senses that you may the better judge
If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of
Caesars to him I say that Brutus love to Caesar
was no less than his If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer
NAME
Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live
all free men As Caesar loved me I weep for him
as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was
valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I
slew him There is tears for his love joy for his
fortune honour for his valour and death for his
ambition Who is here so base that would be a
bondman If any speak for him have I offended
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If
any speak for him have I offended Who is here so
vile that will not love his country If any speak
for him have I offended I pause for a reply
None Brutus none
Then none have I offended I have done no more to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol his glory not
extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences
enforced for which he suffered death
Enter ANTONY and others with CAESARs body
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who
though he had no hand in his death shall receive
the benefit of his dying a place in the
commonwealth as which of you shall not With this
I departthat as I slew my best lover for the
good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself
when it shall please my country to need my death
Live Brutus live live
Bring him with triumph home unto his house
Give him a statue with his ancestors
Let him be Caesar
Caesars better parts
Shall be crownd in Brutus
Well bring him to his house
With shouts and clamours
My countrymen
Peace silence Brutus speaks
Peace ho
Good countrymen let me depart alone
And for my sake stay here with Antony
Do grace to Caesars corpse and grace his speech
Tending to Caesars glories which Mark Antony
By our permission is allowd to make
I do entreat you not a man depart
Save I alone till Antony have spoke
Exit
Stay ho and let us hear Mark Antony
Let him go up into the public chair
Well hear him Noble Antony go up
For Brutus sake I am beholding to you
Goes into the pulpit
What does he say of Brutus
He says for Brutus sake
He finds himself beholding to us all
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here
This Caesar was a tyrant
Nay thats certain
We are blest that Rome is rid of him
Peace let us hear what Antony can say
You gentle Romans
Peace ho let us hear him
Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
The evil that men do lives after them
The good is oft interred with their bones
So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
If it were so it was a grievous fault
And grievously hath Caesar answerd it
Here under leave of Brutus and the rest
For Brutus is an honourable man
So are they all all honourable men
Come I to speak in Caesars funeral
He was my friend faithful and just to me
But Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honourable man
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honourable man
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown
Which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And sure he is an honourable man
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
But here I am to speak what I do know
You all did love him once not without cause
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
O judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
And men have lost their reason Bear with me
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
And I must pause till it come back to me
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings
If thou consider rightly of the matter
Caesar has had great wrong
Has he masters
I fear there will a worse come in his place
Markd ye his words He would not take the crown
Therefore tis certain he was not ambitious
If it be found so some will dear abide it
Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
Theres not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
Now mark him he begins again to speak
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world now lies he there
And none so poor to do him reverence
O masters if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
Who you all know are honourable men
I will not do them wrong I rather choose
To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
Than I will wrong such honourable men
But heres a parchment with the seal of Caesar
I found it in his closet tis his will
Let but the commons hear this testament
Which pardon me I do not mean to read
And they would go and kiss dead Caesars wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
Yea beg a hair of him for memory
And dying mention it within their wills
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue
Well hear the will read it Mark Antony
The will the will we will hear Caesars will
Have patience gentle friends I must not read it
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
You are not wood you are not stones but men
And being men bearing the will of Caesar
It will inflame you it will make you mad
Tis good you know not that you are his heirs
For if you should O what would come of it
Read the will well hear it Antony
You shall read us the will Caesars will
Will you be patient will you stay awhile
I have oershot myself to tell you of it
I fear I wrong the honourable men
Whose daggers have stabbd Caesar I do fear it
They were traitors honourable men
The will the testament
They were villains murderers the will read the will
You will compel me then to read the will
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar
And let me show you him that made the will
Shall I descend and will you give me leave
Come down
Descend
You shall have leave
ANTONY comes down
A ring stand round
Stand from the hearse stand from the body
Room for Antony most noble Antony
Nay press not so upon me stand far off
Stand back room bear back
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
You all do know this mantle I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on
Twas on a summers evening in his tent
That day he overcame the Nervii
Look in this place ran Cassius dagger through
See what a rent the envious Casca made
Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabbd
And as he pluckd his cursed steel away
Mark how the blood of Caesar followd it
As rushing out of doors to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knockd or no
For Brutus as you know was Caesars angel
Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkindest cut of all
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab
Ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
Quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart
And in his mantle muffling up his face
Even at the base of Pompeys statua
Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
O what a fall was there my countrymen
Then I and you and all of us fell down
Whilst bloody treason flourishd over us
O now you weep and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity these are gracious drops
Kind souls what weep you when you but behold
Our Caesars vesture wounded Look you here
Here is himself marrd as you see with traitors
O piteous spectacle
O noble Caesar
O woful day
O traitors villains
O most bloody sight
We will be revenged
Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill Slay
Let not a traitor live
Stay countrymen
Peace there hear the noble Antony
Well hear him well follow him well die with him
Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny
They that have done this deed are honourable
What private griefs they have alas I know not
That made them do it they are wise and honourable
And will no doubt with reasons answer you
I come not friends to steal away your hearts
I am no orator as Brutus is
But as you know me all a plain blunt man
That love my friend and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him
For I have neither wit nor words nor worth
To stir mens blood I only speak right on
I tell you that which you yourselves do know
Show you sweet Caesars wounds poor poor dumb mouths
And bid them speak for me but were I Brutus
And Brutus Antony there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
Well mutiny
Well burn the house of Brutus
Away then come seek the conspirators
Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
Peace ho Hear Antony Most noble Antony
Why friends you go to do you know not what
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
Alas you know not I must tell you then
You have forgot the will I told you of
Most true The will Lets stay and hear the will
Here is the will and under Caesars seal
To every Roman citizen he gives
To every several man seventyfive drachmas
Most noble Caesar Well revenge his death
O royal Caesar
Hear me with patience
Peace ho
Moreover he hath left you all his walks
His private arbours and newplanted orchards
On this side Tiber he hath left them you
And to your heirs for ever common pleasures
To walk abroad and recreate yourselves
Here was a Caesar when comes such another
Never never Come away away
Well burn his body in the holy place
And with the brands fire the traitors houses
Take up the body
Go fetch fire
Pluck down benches
Pluck down forms windows any thing
Exeunt Citizens with the body
Now let it work Mischief thou art afoot
Take thou what course thou wilt
Enter a Servant
How now fellow
Sir Octavius is already come to Rome
Where is he
He and Lepidus are at Caesars house
And thither will I straight to visit him
He comes upon a wish Fortune is merry
And in this mood will give us any thing
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome
Belike they had some notice of the people
How I had moved them Bring me to Octavius
Exeunt
Enter CINNA the poet
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar
And things unlucky charge my fantasy
I have no will to wander forth of doors
Yet something leads me forth
Enter Citizens

Ay and briefly
Ay and wisely
Ay and truly you were best
What is my name Whither am I going Where do I
dwell Am I a married man or a bachelor Then to
answer every man directly and briefly wisely and
truly wisely I say I am a bachelor
Thats as much as to say they are fools that marry
youll bear me a bang for that I fear Proceed directly
Directly I am going to Caesars funeral
As a friend or an enemy
As a friend
That matter is answered directly
For your dwellingbriefly
Briefly I dwell by the Capitol
Your name sir truly
Truly my name is Cinna
Tear him to pieces hes a conspirator
I am Cinna the poet I am Cinna the poet

name out of his heart and turn him going
Tear him tear him Come brands ho firebrands

Exeunt
ANTONY OCTAVIUS and LEPIDUS seated at a table
These many then shall die their names are prickd
Your brother too must die consent you Lepidus
I do consent
Prick him down Antony
Upon condition Publius shall not live
Who is your sisters son Mark Antony
He shall not live look with a spot I damn him
But Lepidus go you to Caesars house
Fetch the will hither and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies
What shall I find you here
Or here or at the Capitol
Exit LEPIDUS
This is a slight unmeritable man
Meet to be sent on errands is it fit
The threefold world divided he should stand
One of the three to share it
So you thought him
And took his voice who should be prickd to die
In our black sentence and proscription
Octavius I have seen more days than you
And though we lay these honours on this man
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
To groan and sweat under the business
Either led or driven as we point the way
And having brought our treasure where we will
Then take we down his load and turn him off
Like to the empty ass to shake his ears
And graze in commons
You may do your will
But hes a tried and valiant soldier
So is my horse Octavius and for that
I do appoint him store of provender
It is a creature that I teach to fight
To wind to stop to run directly on
His corporal motion governd by my spirit
And in some taste is Lepidus but so
He must be taught and traind and bid go forth
A barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
On abjects orts and imitations
Which out of use and staled by other men
Begin his fashion do not talk of him
But as a property And now Octavius
Listen great thingsBrutus and Cassius
Are levying powers we must straight make head
Therefore let our alliance be combined
Our best friends made our means stretchd
And let us presently go sit in council
How covert matters may be best disclosed
And open perils surest answered
Let us do so for we are at the stake
And bayd about with many enemies
And some that smile have in their hearts I fear
Millions of mischiefs
Exeunt
Drum Enter BRUTUS LUCILIUS LUCIUS and Soldiers TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them
Stand ho
Give the word ho and stand
What now Lucilius is Cassius near
He is at hand and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master
He greets me well Your master Pindarus
In his own change or by ill officers
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done undone but if he be at hand
I shall be satisfied
I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is full of regard and honour
He is not doubted A word Lucilius
How he received you let me be resolved
With courtesy and with respect enough
But not with such familiar instances
Nor with such free and friendly conference
As he hath used of old
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling ever note Lucilius
When love begins to sicken and decay
It useth an enforced ceremony
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith
But hollow men like horses hot at hand
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle
But when they should endure the bloody spur
They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
Sink in the trial Comes his army on
They mean this night in Sardis to be quarterd
The greater part the horse in general
Are come with Cassius
Hark he is arrived
Low march within
March gently on to meet him
Enter CASSIUS and his powers
Stand ho
Stand ho Speak the word along
Stand
Stand
Stand
Most noble brother you have done me wrong
Judge me you gods wrong I mine enemies
And if not so how should I wrong a brother
Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
And when you do them
Cassius be content
Speak your griefs softly I do know you well
Before the eyes of both our armies here
Which should perceive nothing but love from us
Let us not wrangle bid them move away
Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
And I will give you audience
Pindarus
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground
Lucilius do you the like and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door
Exeunt
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS
That you have wrongd me doth appear in this
You have condemnd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians
Wherein my letters praying on his side
Because I knew the man were slighted off
You wronged yourself to write in such a case
In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment
Let me tell you Cassius you yourself
Are much condemnd to have an itching palm
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers
I an itching palm
You know that you are Brutus that speak this
Or by the gods this speech were else your last
The name of Cassius honours this corruption
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
Chastisement
Remember March the ides of March remember
Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake
What villain touchd his body that did stab
And not for justice What shall one of us
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
And sell the mighty space of our large honours
For so much trash as may be grasped thus
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
Than such a Roman
Brutus bay not me
Ill not endure it you forget yourself
To hedge me in I am a soldier I
To make conditions
Go to you are not Cassius
I am
I say you are not
Urge me no more I shall forget myself
Have mind upon your health tempt me no further
Away slight man
Ist possible
Hear me for I will speak
Must I give way and room to your rash choler
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
O ye gods ye gods must I endure all this
All this ay more fret till your proud heart break
Go show your slaves how choleric you are
And make your bondmen tremble Must I budge
Must I observe you must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen
Though it do split you for from this day forth
Ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
When you are waspish
Is it come to this
You say you are a better soldier
Let it appear so make your vaunting true
And it shall please me well for mine own part
I shall be glad to learn of noble men
You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
I said an elder soldier not a better
Did I say better
If you did I care not
When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
Peace peace you durst not so have tempted him
I durst not
No
What durst not tempt him
For your life you durst not
Do not presume too much upon my love
I may do that I shall be sorry for
You have done that you should be sorry for
There is no terror Cassius in your threats
For I am armd so strong in honesty
That they pass by me as the idle wind
Which I respect not I did send to you
For certain sums of gold which you denied me
For I can raise no money by vile means
By heaven I had rather coin my heart
And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions
Which you denied me was that done like Cassius
Should I have answerd Caius Cassius so
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
To lock such rascal counters from his friends
Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
Dash him to pieces
I denied you not
You did
I did not he was but a fool that brought
My answer back Brutus hath rived my heart
A friend should bear his friends infirmities
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
You love me not
I do not like your faults
A friendly eye could never see such faults
A flatterers would not though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus
Come Antony and young Octavius come
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius
For Cassius is aweary of the world
Hated by one he loves braved by his brother
Chequed like a bondman all his faults observed
Set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote
To cast into my teeth O I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger
And here my naked breast within a heart
Dearer than Plutus mine richer than gold
If that thou best a Roman take it forth
I that denied thee gold will give my heart
Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know
When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius
Sheathe your dagger
Be angry when you will it shall have scope
Do what you will dishonour shall be humour
O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger as the flint bears fire
Who much enforced shows a hasty spark
And straight is cold again
Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
When grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him
When I spoke that I was illtemperd too
Do you confess so much Give me your hand
And my heart too
O Brutus
Whats the matter
Have not you love enough to bear with me
When that rash humour which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful
Yes Cassius and from henceforth
When you are overearnest with your Brutus
Hell think your mother chides and leave you so
Within  Let me go in to see the generals
There is some grudge between em tis not meet
They be alone
Within  You shall not come to them
Within  Nothing but death shall stay me
Enter Poet followed by LUCILIUS TITINIUS and LUCIUS
How now whats the matter
For shame you generals what do you mean
Love and be friends as two such men should be
For I have seen more years Im sure than ye
Ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
Get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
Bear with him Brutus tis his fashion
Ill know his humour when he knows his time
What should the wars do with these jigging fools
Companion hence
Away away be gone
Exit Poet
Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies tonight
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us
Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS
Lucius a bowl of wine
Exit LUCIUS
I did not think you could have been so angry
O Cassius I am sick of many griefs
Of your philosophy you make no use
If you give place to accidental evils
No man bears sorrow better Portia is dead
Ha Portia
She is dead
How scaped I killing when I crossd you so
O insupportable and touching loss
Upon what sickness
Impatient of my absence
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Have made themselves so strongfor with her death
And her attendants absent swallowd fire
And died so
Even so
O ye immortal gods
Reenter LUCIUS with wine and taper
Speak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine
In this I bury all unkindness Cassius
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
Fill Lucius till the wine oerswell the cup
I cannot drink too much of Brutus love
Come in Titinius
Exit LUCIUS
Reenter TITINIUS with MESSALA
Welcome good Messala
Now sit we close about this taper here
And call in question our necessities
Portia art thou gone
No more I pray you
Messala I have here received letters
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power
Bending their expedition toward Philippi
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor
With what addition
That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius Antony and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred senators
Therein our letters do not well agree
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions Cicero being one
Cicero one
Cicero is dead
And by that order of proscription
Had you your letters from your wife my lord
No Messala
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
Nothing Messala
That methinks is strange
Why ask you hear you aught of her in yours
No my lord
Now as you are a Roman tell me true
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
For certain she is dead and by strange manner
Why farewell Portia We must die Messala
With meditating that she must die once
I have the patience to endure it now
Even so great men great losses should endure
I have as much of this in art as you
But yet my nature could not bear it so
Well to our work alive What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently
I do not think it good
Your reason
This it is
Tis better that the enemy seek us
So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
Doing himself offence whilst we lying still
Are full of rest defense and nimbleness
Good reasons must of force give place to better
The people twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection
For they have grudged us contribution
The enemy marching along by them
By them shall make a fuller number up
Come on refreshd newadded and encouraged
From which advantage shall we cut him off
If at Philippi we do face him there
These people at our back
Hear me good brother
Under your pardon You must note beside
That we have tried the utmost of our friends
Our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
The enemy increaseth every day
We at the height are ready to decline
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
Omitted all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries
On such a full sea are we now afloat
And we must take the current when it serves
Or lose our ventures
Then with your will go on
Well along ourselves and meet them at Philippi
The deep of night is crept upon our talk
And nature must obey necessity
Which we will niggard with a little rest
There is no more to say
No more Good night
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence
Lucius
Enter LUCIUS
My gown
Exit LUCIUS
Farewell good Messala
Good night Titinius Noble noble Cassius
Good night and good repose
O my dear brother
This was an ill beginning of the night
Never come such division tween our souls
Let it not Brutus
Every thing is well
Good night my lord
Good night good brother
Good night Lord Brutus
Farewell every one
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
Reenter LUCIUS with the gown
Give me the gown Where is thy instrument
Here in the tent
What thou speakst drowsily
Poor knave I blame thee not thou art oerwatchd
Call Claudius and some other of my men
Ill have them sleep on cushions in my tent
Varro and Claudius
Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS
Calls my lord
I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius
So please you we will stand and watch your pleasure
I will not have it so lie down good sirs
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me
Look Lucius heres the book I sought for so
I put it in the pocket of my gown
VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down
I was sure your lordship did not give it me
Bear with me good boy I am much forgetful
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile
And touch thy instrument a strain or two
Ay my lord ant please you
It does my boy
I trouble thee too much but thou art willing
It is my duty sir
I should not urge thy duty past thy might
I know young bloods look for a time of rest
I have slept my lord already
It was well done and thou shalt sleep again
I will not hold thee long if I do live
I will be good to thee
Music and a song
This is a sleepy tune O murderous slumber
Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
That plays thee music Gentle knave good night
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee
If thou dost nod thou breakst thy instrument
Ill take it from thee and good boy good night
Let me see let me see is not the leaf turnd down
Where I left reading Here it is I think
Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
How ill this taper burns Ha who comes here
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition
It comes upon me Art thou any thing
Art thou some god some angel or some devil
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare
Speak to me what thou art
Thy evil spirit Brutus
Why comest thou
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
Well then I shall see thee again
Ay at Philippi
Why I will see thee at Philippi then
Exit Ghost
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest
Ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee
Boy Lucius Varro Claudius Sirs awake Claudius
The strings my lord are false
He thinks he still is at his instrument
Lucius awake
My lord
Didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out
My lord I do not know that I did cry
Yes that thou didst didst thou see any thing
Nothing my lord
Sleep again Lucius Sirrah Claudius
To VARRO
Fellow thou awake
My lord
My lord
Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep
Did we my lord
Ay saw you any thing
No my lord I saw nothing
Nor I my lord
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius
Bid him set on his powers betimes before
And we will follow
It shall be done my lord
Exeunt
Enter OCTAVIUS ANTONY and their army
Now Antony our hopes are answered
You said the enemy would not come down
But keep the hills and upper regions
It proves not so their battles are at hand
They mean to warn us at Philippi here
Answering before we do demand of them
Tut I am in their bosoms and I know
Wherefore they do it they could be content
To visit other places and come down
With fearful bravery thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
But tis not so
Enter a Messenger
Prepare you generals
The enemy comes on in gallant show
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out
And something to be done immediately
Octavius lead your battle softly on
Upon the left hand of the even field
Upon the right hand I keep thou the left
Why do you cross me in this exigent
I do not cross you but I will do so
March
Drum Enter BRUTUS CASSIUS and their Army LUCILIUS TITINIUS MESSALA and others
They stand and would have parley
Stand fast Titinius we must out and talk
Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
No Caesar we will answer on their charge
Make forth the generals would have some words
Stir not until the signal
Words before blows is it so countrymen
Not that we love words better as you do
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
Witness the hole you made in Caesars heart
Crying Long live hail Caesar
Antony
The posture of your blows are yet unknown
But for your words they rob the Hybla bees
And leave them honeyless
Not stingless too
O yes and soundless too
For you have stoln their buzzing Antony
And very wisely threat before you sting
Villains you did not so when your vile daggers
Hackd one another in the sides of Caesar
You showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds
And bowd like bondmen kissing Caesars feet
Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind
Struck Caesar on the neck O you flatterers
Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
This tongue had not offended so today
If Cassius might have ruled
Come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
The proof of it will turn to redder drops Look
I draw a sword against conspirators
When think you that the sword goes up again
Never till Caesars three and thirty wounds
Be well avenged or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
Caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
Unless thou bringst them with thee
So I hope
I was not born to die on Brutus sword
O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
Young man thou couldst not die more honourable
A peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour
Joind with a masker and a reveller
Old Cassius still
Come Antony away
Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
If you dare fight today come to the field
If not when you have stomachs
Exeunt OCTAVIUS ANTONY and their army
Why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
The storm is up and all is on the hazard
Ho Lucilius hark a word with you
Standing forthMy lord
BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart
Messala
Standing forth  What says my general
Messala
This is my birthday as this very day
Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
Be thou my witness that against my will
As Pompey was am I compelld to set
Upon one battle all our liberties
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion now I change my mind
And partly credit things that do presage
Coming from Sardis on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
Who to Philippi here consorted us
This morning are they fled away and gone
And in their steads do ravens crows and kites
Fly oer our heads and downward look on us
As we were sickly prey their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal under which
Our army lies ready to give up the ghost
Believe not so
I but believe it partly
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly
Even so Lucilius
Now most noble Brutus
The gods today stand friendly that we may
Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain
Lets reason with the worst that may befall
If we do lose this battle then is this
The very last time we shall speak together
What are you then determined to do
Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself I know not how
But I do find it cowardly and vile
For fear of what might fall so to prevent
The time of life arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below
Then if we lose this battle
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome
No Cassius no think not thou noble Roman
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
He bears too great a mind But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun
And whether we shall meet again I know not
Therefore our everlasting farewell take
For ever and for ever farewell Cassius
If we do meet again why we shall smile
If not why then this parting was well made
For ever and for ever farewell Brutus
If we do meet again well smile indeed
If not tis true this parting was well made
Why then lead on O that a man might know
The end of this days business ere it come
But it sufficeth that the day will end
And then the end is known Come ho away
Exeunt
Alarum Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA
Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side
Loud alarum
Let them set on at once for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius wing
And sudden push gives them the overthrow
Ride ride Messala let them all come down
Exeunt
Alarums Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS
O look Titinius look the villains fly
Myself have to mine own turnd enemy
This ensign here of mine was turning back
I slew the coward and did take it from him
O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
Who having some advantage on Octavius
Took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed
Enter PINDARUS
Fly further off my lord fly further off
Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off
This hill is far enough Look look Titinius
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
They are my lord
Titinius if thou lovest me
Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
And here again that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy
I will be here again even with a thought
Exit
Go Pindarus get higher on that hill
My sight was ever thick regard Titinius
And tell me what thou notest about the field
PINDARUS ascends the hill
This day I breathed first time is come round
And where I did begin there shall I end
My life is run his compass Sirrah what news
Above  O my lord
What news
Above  Titinius is enclosed round about
With horsemen that make to him on the spur
Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him
Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too
Hes taen
Shout
And hark they shout for joy
Come down behold no more
O coward that I am to live so long
To see my best friend taen before my face
PINDARUS descends
Come hither sirrah
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner
And then I swore thee saving of thy life
That whatsoever I did bid thee do
Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath
Now be a freeman and with this good sword
That ran through Caesars bowels search this bosom
Stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
And when my face is coverd as tis now
Guide thou the sword
PINDARUS stabs him
Caesar thou art revenged
Even with the sword that killd thee
Dies
So I am free yet would not so have been
Durst I have done my will O Cassius
Far from this country Pindarus shall run
Where never Roman shall take note of him
Exit
Reenter TITINIUS with MESSALA
It is but change Titinius for Octavius
Is overthrown by noble Brutus power
As Cassius legions are by Antony
These tidings will well comfort Cassius
Where did you leave him
All disconsolate
With Pindarus his bondman on this hill
Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground
He lies not like the living O my heart
Is not that he
No this was he Messala
But Cassius is no more O setting sun
As in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight
So in his red blood Cassius day is set
The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone
Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed
O hateful error melancholys child
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not O error soon conceived
Thou never comest unto a happy birth
But killst the mother that engenderd thee
What Pindarus where art thou Pindarus
Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus thrusting this report
Into his ears I may say thrusting it
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight
Hie you Messala
And I will seek for Pindarus the while
Exit MESSALA
Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
Did I not meet thy friends and did not they
Put on my brows this wreath of victory
And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts
Alas thou hast misconstrued every thing
But hold thee take this garland on thy brow
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I
Will do his bidding Brutus come apace
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius
By your leave godsthis is a Romans part
Come Cassius sword and find Titinius heart
Kills himself
Alarum Reenter MESSALA with BRUTUS CATO STRATO VOLUMNIUS and LUCILIUS
Where where Messala doth his body lie
Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it
Titinius face is upward
He is slain
O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails
Low alarums
Brave Titinius
Look whether he have not crownd dead Cassius
Are yet two Romans living such as these
The last of all the Romans fare thee well
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow Friends I owe more tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay
I shall find time Cassius I shall find time
Come therefore and to Thasos send his body
His funerals shall not be in our camp
Lest it discomfort us Lucilius come
And come young Cato let us to the field
Labeo and Flavius set our battles on
Tis three oclock and Romans yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight
Exeunt
Alarum Enter fighting Soldiers of both armies then BRUTUS CATO LUCILIUS and others
Yet countrymen O yet hold up your heads
What bastard doth not Who will go with me
I will proclaim my name about the field
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
A foe to tyrants and my countrys friend
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I
Brutus my countrys friend know me for Brutus
Exit
O young and noble Cato art thou down
Why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius
And mayst be honourd being Catos son
Yield or thou diest
Only I yield to die
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight
Offering money
Kill Brutus and be honourd in his death
We must not A noble prisoner
Room ho Tell Antony Brutus is taen
Ill tell the news Here comes the general
Enter ANTONY
Brutus is taen Brutus is taen my lord
Where is he
Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus
The gods defend him from so great a shame
When you do find him or alive or dead
He will be found like Brutus like himself
This is not Brutus friend but I assure you
A prize no less in worth keep this man safe
Give him all kindness I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies Go on
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead
And bring us word unto Octavius tent
How every thing is chanced
Exeunt
Enter BRUTUS DARDANIUS CLITUS STRATO and VOLUMNIUS
Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
Statilius showd the torchlight but my lord
He came not back he is or taen or slain
Sit thee down Clitus slaying is the word
It is a deed in fashion Hark thee Clitus
Whispers
What I my lord No not for all the world
Peace then no words
Ill rather kill myself
Hark thee Dardanius
Whispers
Shall I do such a deed
O Dardanius
O Clitus
What ill request did Brutus make to thee
To kill him Clitus Look he meditates
Now is that noble vessel full of grief
That it runs over even at his eyes
Come hither good Volumnius list a word
What says my lord
Why this Volumnius
The ghost of Caesar hath appeard to me
Two several times by night at Sardis once
And this last night here in Philippi fields
I know my hour is come
Not so my lord
Nay I am sure it is Volumnius
Thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes
Our enemies have beat us to the pit
Low alarums
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
Than tarry till they push us Good Volumnius
Thou knowst that we two went to school together
Even for that our love of old I prithee
Hold thou my swordhilts whilst I run on it
Thats not an office for a friend my lord
Alarum still
Fly fly my lord there is no tarrying here
Farewell to you and you and you Volumnius
Strato thou hast been all this while asleep
Farewell to thee too Strato Countrymen
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto
So fare you well at once for Brutus tongue
Hath almost ended his lifes history
Night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest
That have but labourd to attain this hour
Alarum Cry within Fly fly fly
Fly my lord fly
Hence I will follow
Exeunt CLITUS DARDANIUS and VOLUMNIUS
I prithee Strato stay thou by thy lord
Thou art a fellow of a good respect
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face
While I do run upon it Wilt thou Strato
Give me your hand first Fare you well my lord
Farewell good Strato
Runs on his sword
Caesar now be still
I killd not thee with half so good a will
Dies
Alarum Retreat Enter OCTAVIUS ANTONY MESSALA LUCILIUS and the army
What man is that
My masters man Strato where is thy master
Free from the bondage you are in Messala
The conquerors can but make a fire of him
For Brutus only overcame himself
And no man else hath honour by his death
So Brutus should be found I thank thee Brutus
That thou hast proved Lucilius saying true
All that served Brutus I will entertain them
Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
Ay if Messala will prefer me to you
Do so good Messala
How died my master Strato
I held the sword and he did run on it
Octavius then take him to follow thee
That did the latest service to my master
This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar
He only in a general honest thought
And common good to all made one of them
His life was gentle and the elements
So mixd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world This was a man
According to his virtue let us use him
With all respect and rites of burial
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
Most like a soldier orderd honourably
So call the field to rest and lets away
To part the glories of this happy day
Exeunt
Enter KENT GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
Albany than Cornwall
It did always seem so to us but now in the
division of the kingdom it appears not which of
the dukes he values most for equalities are so
weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice
of eithers moiety
Is not this your son my lord
His breeding sir hath been at my charge I have
so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am
brazed to it
I cannot conceive you
Sir this young fellows mother could whereupon
she grew roundwombed and had indeed sir a son
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed
Do you smell a fault
I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it
being so proper
But I have sir a son by order of law some year
elder than this who yet is no dearer in my account
though this knave came something saucily into the
world before he was sent for yet was his mother
fair there was good sport at his making and the
whoreson must be acknowledged Do you know this
noble gentleman Edmund
No my lord
My lord of Kent remember him hereafter as my
honourable friend
My services to your lordship
I must love you and sue to know you better
Sir I shall study deserving
He hath been out nine years and away he shall
again The king is coming
Sennet Enter KING LEAR CORNWALL ALBANY GONERIL REGAN CORDELIA and Attendants
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy Gloucester
I shall my liege
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose
Give me the map there Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom and tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age
Conferring them on younger strengths while we
Unburthend crawl toward death Our son of Cornwall
And you our no less loving son of Albany
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters several dowers that future strife
May be prevented now The princes France and Burgundy
Great rivals in our youngest daughters love
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
And here are to be answerd Tell me my daughters
Since now we will divest us both of rule
Interest of territory cares of state
Which of you shall we say doth love us most
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge Goneril
Our eldestborn speak first
Sir I love you more than words can wield the matter
Dearer than eyesight space and liberty
Beyond what can be valued rich or rare
No less than life with grace health beauty honour
As much as child eer loved or father found
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable
Beyond all manner of so much I love you
Aside  What shall Cordelia do
Love and be silent
Of all these bounds even from this line to this
With shadowy forests and with champains richd
With plenteous rivers and wideskirted meads
We make thee lady to thine and Albanys issue
Be this perpetual What says our second daughter
Our dearest Regan wife to Cornwall Speak
Sir I am made
Of the selfsame metal that my sister is
And prize me at her worth In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love
Only she comes too short that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense possesses
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness love
AsideThen poor Cordelia
And yet not so since I am sure my loves
More richer than my tongue
To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
No less in space validity and pleasure
Than that conferrd on Goneril Now our joy
Although the last not least to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interessd what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters Speak
Nothing my lord
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing will come of nothing speak again
Unhappy that I am I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth I love your majesty
According to my bond nor more nor less
How how Cordelia mend your speech a little
Lest it may mar your fortunes
Good my lord
You have begot me bred me loved me I
Return those duties back as are right fit
Obey you love you and most honour you
Why have my sisters husbands if they say
They love you all Haply when I shall wed
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him half my care and duty
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters
To love my father all
But goes thy heart with this
Ay good my lord
So young and so untender
So young my lord and true
Let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
For by the sacred radiance of the sun
The mysteries of Hecate and the night
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be
Here I disclaim all my paternal care
Propinquity and property of blood
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever The barbarous Scythian
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbourd pitied and relieved
As thou my sometime daughter
Good my liege
Peace Kent
Come not between the dragon and his wrath
I loved her most and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery Hence and avoid my sight
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Her fathers heart from her Call France who stirs
Call Burgundy Cornwall and Albany
With my two daughters dowers digest this third
Let pride which she calls plainness marry her
I do invest you jointly with my power
Preeminence and all the large effects
That troop with majesty Ourself by monthly course
With reservation of an hundred knights
By you to be sustaind shall our abode
Make with you by due turns Only we still retain
The name and all the additions to a king
The sway revenue execution of the rest
Beloved sons be yours which to confirm
This coronet part betwixt you
Giving the crown
Royal Lear
Whom I have ever honourd as my king
Loved as my father as my master followd
As my great patron thought on in my prayers
The bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft
Let it fall rather though the fork invade
The region of my heart be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad What wilt thou do old man
Thinkst thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows To plainness honours bound
When majesty stoops to folly Reverse thy doom
And in thy best consideration cheque
This hideous rashness answer my life my judgment
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
Nor are those emptyhearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness
Kent on thy life no more
My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thy enemies nor fear to lose it
Thy safety being the motive
Out of my sight
See better Lear and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye
Now by Apollo
Now by Apollo king
Thou swearst thy gods in vain
O vassal miscreant
Laying his hand on his sword
Dear sir forbear
Do
Kill thy physician and the fee bestow
Upon thy foul disease Revoke thy doom
Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat
Ill tell thee thou dost evil
Hear me recreant
On thine allegiance hear me
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
Which we durst never yet and with straind pride
To come between our sentence and our power
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear
Our potency made good take thy reward
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom if on the tenth day following
Thy banishd trunk be found in our dominions
The moment is thy death Away by Jupiter
This shall not be revoked
Fare thee well king sith thus thou wilt appear
Freedom lives hence and banishment is here
To CORDELIA
The gods to their dear shelter take thee maid
That justly thinkst and hast most rightly said
To REGAN and GONERIL
And your large speeches may your deeds approve
That good effects may spring from words of love
Thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu
Hell shape his old course in a country new
Exit
Flourish Reenter GLOUCESTER with KING OF FRANCE BURGUNDY and Attendants
Heres France and Burgundy my noble lord
My lord of Burgundy
We first address towards you who with this king
Hath rivalld for our daughter what in the least
Will you require in present dower with her
Or cease your quest of love
Most royal majesty
I crave no more than what your highness offerd
Nor will you tender less
Right noble Burgundy
When she was dear to us we did hold her so
But now her price is falln Sir there she stands
If aught within that little seeming substance
Or all of it with our displeasure pieced
And nothing more may fitly like your grace
Shes there and she is yours
I know no answer
Will you with those infirmities she owes
Unfriended newadopted to our hate
Dowerd with our curse and strangerd with our oath
Take her or leave her
Pardon me royal sir
Election makes not up on such conditions
Then leave her sir for by the power that made me
I tell you all her wealth
To KING OF FRANCE
For you great king
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate therefore beseech you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
Almost to acknowledge hers
This is most strange
That she that even but now was your best object
The argument of your praise balm of your age
Most best most dearest should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favour Sure her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it or your forevouchd affection
Falln into taint which to believe of her
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Could never plant in me
I yet beseech your majesty
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not since what I well intend
Ill dot before I speakthat you make known
It is no vicious blot murder or foulness
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour
But even for want of that for which I am richer
A stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking
Better thou
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better
Is it but thisa tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do My lord of Burgundy
What say you to the lady Loves not love
When it is mingled with regards that stand
Aloof from the entire point Will you have her
She is herself a dowry
Royal Lear
Give but that portion which yourself proposed
And here I take Cordelia by the hand
Duchess of Burgundy
Nothing I have sworn I am firm
I am sorry then you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband
Peace be with Burgundy
Since that respects of fortune are his love
I shall not be his wife
Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor
Most choice forsaken and most loved despised
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon
Be it lawful I take up whats cast away
Gods gods tis strange that from their coldst neglect
My love should kindle to inflamed respect
Thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance
Is queen of us of ours and our fair France
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me
Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind
Thou losest here a better where to find
Thou hast her France let her be thine for we
Have no such daughter nor shall ever see
That face of hers again Therefore be gone
Without our grace our love our benison
Come noble Burgundy
Flourish Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE GONERIL REGAN and CORDELIA
Bid farewell to your sisters
The jewels of our father with washd eyes
Cordelia leaves you I know you what you are
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named Use well our father
To your professed bosoms I commit him
But yet alas stood I within his grace
I would prefer him to a better place
So farewell to you both
Prescribe not us our duties
Let your study
Be to content your lord who hath received you
At fortunes alms You have obedience scanted
And well are worth the want that you have wanted
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides
Who cover faults at last shame them derides
Well may you prosper
Come my fair Cordelia
Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA
Sister it is not a little I have to say of what
most nearly appertains to us both I think our
father will hence tonight
Thats most certain and with you next month with us
You see how full of changes his age is the
observation we have made of it hath not been
little he always loved our sister most and
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
appears too grossly
Tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever
but slenderly known himself
The best and soundest of his time hath been but
rash then must we look to receive from his age
not alone the imperfections of longengraffed
condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
him as this of Kents banishment
There is further compliment of leavetaking
between France and him Pray you lets hit
together if our father carry authority with
such dispositions as he bears this last
surrender of his will but offend us
We shall further think ont
We must do something and i the heat
Exeunt
Enter EDMUND with a letter
Thou nature art my goddess to thy law
My services are bound Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother Why bastard wherefore base
My mind as generous and my shape as true
As honest madams issue Why brand they us
With base with baseness bastardy base base
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth within a dull stale tired bed
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
Got tween asleep and wake Well then
Legitimate Edgar I must have your land
Our fathers love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate fine wordlegitimate
Well my legitimate if this letter speed
And my invention thrive Edmund the base
Shall top the legitimate I grow I prosper
Now gods stand up for bastards
Enter GLOUCESTER
Kent banishd thus and France in choler parted
And the king gone tonight subscribed his power
Confined to exhibition All this done
Upon the gad Edmund how now what news
So please your lordship none
Putting up the letter
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter
I know no news my lord
What paper were you reading
Nothing my lord
No What needed then that terrible dispatch of
it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath
not such need to hide itself Lets see come
if it be nothing I shall not need spectacles
I beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter
from my brother that I have not all oerread
and for so much as I have perused I find it not
fit for your oerlooking
Give me the letter sir
I shall offend either to detain or give it The
contents as in part I understand them are to blame
Lets see lets see
I hope for my brothers justification he wrote
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue
Reads  This policy and reverence of age makes
the world bitter to the best of our times keeps
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
them I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not
as it hath power but as it is suffered Come to
me that of this I may speak more If our father
would sleep till I waked him you should half his
revenue for ever and live the beloved of your
brotherEDGAR
HumconspiracySleep till I waked himyou
should enjoy half his revenueMy son Edgar
Had he a hand to write this a heart and brain
to breed it inWhen came this to you who
brought it
It was not brought me my lord theres the
cunning of it I found it thrown in at the
casement of my closet
If the matter were good my lord I durst swear
it were his but in respect of that I would
fain think it were not
It is his
It is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is
not in the contents
Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business
Never my lord but I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age
and fathers declining the father should be as
ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
O villain villain His very opinion in the
letter Abhorred villain Unnatural detested
brutish villain worse than brutish Go sirrah
seek him Ill apprehend him abominable villain
Where is he
I do not well know my lord If it shall please
you to suspend your indignation against my
brother till you can derive from him better
testimony of his intent you shall run a certain
course where if you violently proceed against
him mistaking his purpose it would make a great
gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the
heart of his obedience I dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath wrote this to feel my
affection to your honour and to no further
pretence of danger
Think you so
If your honour judge it meet I will place you
where you shall hear us confer of this and by an
that without any further delay than this very evening
He cannot be such a monster
Nor is not sure
To his father that so tenderly and entirely
loves him Heaven and earth Edmund seek him
out wind me into him I pray you frame the
business after your own wisdom I would unstate
myself to be in a due resolution
I will seek him sir presently convey the
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
no good to us though the wisdom of nature can
reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself
scourged by the sequent effects love cools
friendship falls off brothers divide in
cities mutinies in countries discord in
palaces treason and the bond cracked twixt son
and father This villain of mine comes under the
prediction theres son against father the king
falls from bias of nature theres father against
child We have seen the best of our time
machinations hollowness treachery and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our
graves Find out this villain Edmund it shall
lose thee nothing do it carefully And the
noble and truehearted Kent banished his
offence honesty Tis strange
Exit
This is the excellent foppery of the world that
when we are sick in fortuneoften the surfeit
of our own behaviorwe make guilty of our
disasters the sun the moon and the stars as
if we were villains by necessity fools by
heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and
treachers by spherical predominance drunkards
liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence and all that we are evil in
by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion
of whoremaster man to lay his goatish
disposition to the charge of a star My
father compounded with my mother under the
dragons tail and my nativity was under Ursa
major so that it follows I am rough and
lecherous Tut I should have been that I am
had the maidenliest star in the firmament
twinkled on my bastardizing Edgar
Enter EDGAR
And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
comedy my cue is villanous melancholy with a
sigh like Tom o Bedlam O these eclipses do
portend these divisions fa sol la mi
How now brother Edmund what serious
contemplation are you in
I am thinking brother of a prediction I read
this other day what should follow these eclipses
Do you busy yourself about that
I promise you the effects he writes of succeed
unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child
and the parent death dearth dissolutions of
ancient amities divisions in state menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles needless
diffidences banishment of friends dissipation
of cohorts nuptial breaches and I know not what
How long have you been a sectary astronomical
Come come when saw you my father last
Why the night gone by
Spake you with him
Ay two hours together
Parted you in good terms Found you no
displeasure in him by word or countenance
None at all
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
him and at my entreaty forbear his presence
till some little time hath qualified the heat of
his displeasure which at this instant so rageth
in him that with the mischief of your person it
would scarcely allay
Some villain hath done me wrong
Thats my fear I pray you have a continent
forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
slower and as I say retire with me to my
lodging from whence I will fitly bring you to
hear my lord speak pray ye go theres my key
if you do stir abroad go armed
Armed brother
Brother I advise you to the best go armed I
am no honest man if there be any good meaning
towards you I have told you what I have seen
and heard but faintly nothing like the image
and horror of it pray you away
Shall I hear from you anon
I do serve you in this business

Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none on whose foolish honesty
Let me if not by birth have lands by wit
All with mes meet that I can fashion fit

Enter GONERIL and OSWALD her steward
Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool
Yes madam
By day and night he wrongs me every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other
That sets us all at odds Ill not endure it
His knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us
On every trifle When he returns from hunting
I will not speak with him say I am sick
If you come slack of former services
You shall do well the fault of it Ill answer
Hes coming madam I hear him
Horns within
Put on what weary negligence you please
You and your fellows Ill have it come to question
If he dislike it let him to our sister
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one
Not to be overruled Idle old man
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away Now by my life
Old fools are babes again and must be used
With cheques as flatterieswhen they are seen abused
Remember what I tell you
Well madam
And let his knights have colder looks among you
What grows of it no matter advise your fellows so
I would breed from hence occasions and I shall
That I may speak Ill write straight to my sister
To hold my very course Prepare for dinner

and says little to fear judgment to fight when I
cannot choose and to eat no fish
What art thou

king thou art poor enough What wouldst thou

Sir he answered me in the roundest manner he would

He would not
My lord I know not what the matter is but to my
judgment your highness is not entertained with that
ceremonious affection as you were wont theres a
great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
general dependants as in the duke himself also and
your daughter
Ha sayest thou so
I beseech you pardon me my lord if I be mistaken
for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
highness wronged
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception I
have perceived a most faint neglect of late which I
have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness
I will look further intot But wheres my fool I
have not seen him this two days
Since my young ladys going into France sir the
fool hath much pined away

the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
when thou gavest thy golden one away If I speak
like myself in this let him be whipped that first
finds it so
Singing
Fools had neer less wit in a year
For wise men are grown foppish
They know not how their wits to wear
Their manners are so apish
When were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah
I have used it nuncle ever since thou madest thy
daughters thy mothers for when thou gavest them
the rod and putst down thine own breeches
Singing
Then they for sudden joy did weep
And I for sorrow sung
That such a king should play bopeep
And go the fools among
Prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach
thy fool to lie I would fain learn to lie
An you lie sirrah well have you whipped
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are
theyll have me whipped for speaking true thoult
have me whipped for lying and sometimes I am
whipped for holding my peace I had rather be any
kind o thing than a fool and yet I would not be

Yes forsooth I will hold my tongue so your face
bids me though you say nothing Mum mum
He that keeps nor crust nor crum
Weary of all shall want some
Pointing to KING LEAR
Thats a shealed peascod
Not only sir this your alllicensed fool
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth
In rank and nottobe endured riots Sir
I had thought by making this well known unto you
To have found a safe redress but now grow fearful
By what yourself too late have spoke and done
That you protect this course and put it on
By your allowance which if you should the fault
Would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal
Might in their working do you that offence
Which else were shame that then necessity
Will call discreet proceeding
For you trow nuncle
The hedgesparrow fed the cuckoo so long
That its had it head bit off by it young
So out went the candle and we were left darkling
Are you our daughter
Come sir
I would you would make use of that good wisdom
Whereof I know you are fraught and put away
These dispositions that of late transform you
From what you rightly are
May not an ass know when the cart
draws the horse Whoop Jug I love thee
Doth any here know me This is not Lear
Doth Lear walk thus speak thus Where are his eyes
Either his notion weakens his discernings
Are lethargiedHa waking tis not so
Who is it that can tell me who I am
Lears shadow
I would learn that for by the
marks of sovereignty knowledge and reason
I should be false persuaded I had daughters
Which they will make an obedient father
Your name fair gentlewoman
This admiration sir is much o the savour
Of other your new pranks I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright
As you are old and reverend you should be wise
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires
Men so disorderd so deboshd and bold
That this our court infected with their manners
Shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a graced palace The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy be then desired
By her that else will take the thing she begs
A little to disquantity your train
And the remainder that shall still depend
To be such men as may besort your age
And know themselves and you
Darkness and devils
Saddle my horses call my train together
Degenerate bastard Ill not trouble thee
Yet have I left a daughter
You strike my people and your disorderd rabble
Make servants of their betters
Enter ALBANY
Woe that too late repents

O sir are you come
Is it your will Speak sir Prepare my horses
Ingratitude thou marblehearted fiend
More hideous when thou showst thee in a child
Than the seamonster
Pray sir be patient
To GONERIL  Detested kite thou liest
My train are men of choice and rarest parts
That all particulars of duty know
The worships of their name O most small fault
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show
That like an engine wrenchd my frame of nature
From the fixd place drew from heart all love
And added to the gall O Lear Lear Lear
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in
Striking his head
And thy dear judgment out Go go my people
My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant
Of what hath moved you
It may be so my lord
Hear nature hear dear goddess hear
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful
Into her womb convey sterility
Dry up in her the organs of increase
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her If she must teem
Create her child of spleen that it may live
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks
Turn all her mothers pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt that she may feel
How sharper than a serpents tooth it is
To have a thankless child Away away
Exit
Now gods that we adore whereof comes this
Never afflict yourself to know the cause
But let his disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it
Reenter KING LEAR
What fifty of my followers at a clap
Within a fortnight
Whats the matter sir
Ill tell thee
To GONERIL
Life and death I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus
That these hot tears which break from me perforce
Should make thee worth them Blasts and fogs upon thee
The untented woundings of a fathers curse
Pierce every sense about thee Old fond eyes
Beweep this cause again Ill pluck ye out
And cast you with the waters that you lose
To temper clay Yea it is come to this
Let is be so yet have I left a daughter
Who I am sure is kind and comfortable
When she shall hear this of thee with her nails
Shell flay thy wolvish visage Thou shalt find
That Ill resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever thou shalt
I warrant thee
Exeunt KING LEAR KENT and Attendants
Do you mark that my lord
I cannot be so partial Goneril
To the great love I bear you
Pray you content What Oswald ho

A fox when one has caught her
And such a daughter
Should sure to the slaughter
If my cap would buy a halter
So the fool follows after
Exit
This man hath had good counsela hundred knights
Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights yes that on every dream
Each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike
He may enguard his dotage with their powers
And hold our lives in mercy Oswald I say
Well you may fear too far
Safer than trust too far
Let me still take away the harms I fear
Not fear still to be taken I know his heart
What he hath utterd I have writ my sister
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
When I have showd the unfitness
Reenter OSWALD
How now Oswald
What have you writ that letter to my sister
Yes madam
Take you some company and away to horse
Inform her full of my particular fear
And thereto add such reasons of your own
And hasten your return
Exit OSWALD
No no my lord
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn not yet under pardon
You are much more attaskd for want of wisdom
Than praised for harmful mildness
How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell
Striving to better oft we mar whats well
Nay then
Well well the event

apple yet I can tell what I can tell
Why what canst thou tell my boy
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
crab Thou canst tell why ones nose stands i
the middle ons face
No
Why to keep ones eyes of either sides nose that
what a man cannot smell out he may spy into
I did her wrong
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell
No
Nor I neither but I can tell why a snail has a house
Why
Why to put his head in not to give it away to his
daughters and leave his horns without a case
I will forget my nature So kind a father Be my
horses ready
Thy asses are gone about em The reason why the
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason
Because they are not eight
Yes indeed thou wouldst make a good fool
To take t again perforce Monster ingratitude
If thou wert my fool nuncle Ild have thee beaten

Have you heard of no likely wars toward twixt the
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany

Hes coming hither now i the night i the haste
And Regan with him have you nothing said
Upon his party gainst the Duke of Albany
Advise yourself

Enter GLOUCESTER and Servants with torches
Now Edmund wheres the villain
Here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out
Mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress
But where is he
Look sir I bleed
Where is the villain Edmund
Fled this way sir When by no means he could
Pursue him ho Go after
Exeunt some Servants
By no means what
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship
But that I told him the revenging gods
Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father sir in fine
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose in fell motion
With his prepared sword he charges home
My unprovided body lanced mine arm
But when he saw my best alarumd spirits
Bold in the quarrels right roused to the encounter
Or whether gasted by the noise I made
Full suddenly he fled
Let him fly far
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught
And founddispatch The noble duke my master
My worthy arch and patron comes tonight
By his authority I will proclaim it
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake
He that conceals him death
When I dissuaded him from his intent
And found him pight to do it with curst speech
I threatend to discover him he replied
Thou unpossessing bastard dost thou think
If I would stand against thee would the reposal
Of any trust virtue or worth in thee
Make thy words faithd No what I should deny
As this I would ay though thou didst produce
And thou must make a dullard of the world
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it
Strong and fastend villain
Would he deny his letter I never got him
Tucket within
Hark the dukes trumpets I know not why he comes
All ports Ill bar the villain shall not scape
The duke must grant me that besides his picture
I will send far and near that all the kingdom
May have the due note of him and of my land
Loyal and natural boy Ill work the means
To make thee capable
Enter CORNWALL REGAN and Attendants
How now my noble friend since I came hither
Which I can call but now I have heard strange news
If it be true all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue the offender How dost my lord
O madam my old heart is crackd its crackd
What did my fathers godson seek your life
He whom my father named your Edgar
O lady lady shame would have it hid
Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father
I know not madam tis too bad too bad
Yes madam he was of that consort
No marvel then though he were ill affected
Tis they have put him on the old mans death
To have the expense and waste of his revenues
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well informd of them and with such cautions
That if they come to sojourn at my house
Ill not be there
Nor I assure thee Regan
Edmund I hear that you have shown your father
A childlike office
Twas my duty sir
This hurt you see striving to apprehend him
Is he pursued
Ay my good lord
If he be taken he shall never more
Be feard of doing harm make your own purpose
How in my strength you please For you Edmund
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself you shall be ours
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need
You we first seize on
I shall serve you sir

Enter EDMUND with his rapier drawn CORNWALL REGAN GLOUCESTER and Servants
How now Whats the matter
With you goodman boy an you please come Ill
flesh ye come on young master
Weapons arms What s the matter here
Keep peace upon your lives
He dies that strikes again What is the matter
The messengers from our sister and the king
What is your difference speak
I am scarce in breath my lord
No marvel you have so bestirred your valour You
cowardly rascal nature disclaims in thee a
tailor made thee
Thou art a strange fellow a tailor make a man
Ay a tailor sir a stonecutter or painter could
not have made him so ill though he had been but two
hours at the trade
Speak yet how grew your quarrel
This ancient ruffian sir whose life I have spared
at suit of his gray beard
Thou whoreson zed thou unnecessary letter My
lord if you will give me leave I will tread this
unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of
a jakes with him Spare my gray beard you wagtail
Peace sirrah
You beastly knave know you no reverence
Yes sir but anger hath a privilege
Why art thou angry
That such a slave as this should wear a sword
Who wears no honesty Such smiling rogues as these
Like rats oft bite the holy cords atwain
Which are too intrinse t unloose smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel
Bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods
Renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters
Knowing nought like dogs but following
A plague upon your epileptic visage
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool
Goose if I had you upon Sarum plain
Ild drive ye cackling home to Camelot
Why art thou mad old fellow
How fell you out say that
No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave
Why dost thou call him a knave  Whats his offence
His countenance likes me not
No more perchance does mine nor his nor hers
Sir tis my occupation to be plain
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant
This is some fellow
Who having been praised for bluntness doth affect
A saucy roughness and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature he cannot flatter he
An honest mind and plain he must speak truth
An they will take it so if not hes plain
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty silly ducking observants
That stretch their duties nicely
Sir in good sooth in sincere verity
Under the allowance of your great aspect
Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
On flickering Phoebus front
What meanst by this
To go out of my dialect which you
discommend so much I know sir I am no
flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave which for my part
I will not be though I should win your displeasure
to entreat me to t
What was the offence you gave him
I never gave him any
It pleased the king his master very late
To strike at me upon his misconstruction
When he conjunct and flattering his displeasure
Trippd me behind being down insulted raild
And put upon him such a deal of man
That worthied him got praises of the king
For him attempting who was selfsubdued
And in the fleshment of this dread exploit
Drew on me here again
None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool
Fetch forth the stocks
You stubborn ancient knave you reverend braggart
Well teach you
Sir I am too old to learn
Call not your stocks for me I serve the king
On whose employment I was sent to you
You shall do small respect show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master
Stocking his messenger
Fetch forth the stocks As I have life and honour
There shall he sit till noon
Till noon till night my lord and all night too
Why madam if I were your fathers dog
You should not use me so
Sir being his knave I will
This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
Our sister speaks of Come bring away the stocks
Stocks brought out
Let me beseech your grace not to do so
His fault is much and the good king his master
Will cheque him for t your purposed low correction
Is such as basest and contemnedst wretches
For pilferings and most common trespasses
Are punishd with the king must take it ill
That hes so slightly valued in his messenger
Should have him thus restraind
Ill answer that
My sister may receive it much more worse
To have her gentleman abused assaulted
For following her affairs Put in his legs
KENT is put in the stocks
Come my good lord away
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT
I am sorry for thee friend tis the dukes pleasure
Whose disposition all the world well knows
Will not be rubbd nor stoppd Ill entreat for thee
Pray do not sir I have watched and travelld hard
Some time I shall sleep out the rest Ill whistle
A good mans fortune may grow out at heels
Give you good morrow
The dukes to blame in this twill be ill taken
Exit
Good king that must approve the common saw
Thou out of heavens benediction comest
To the warm sun
Approach thou beacon to this under globe
That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letter Nothing almost sees miracles
But misery I know tis from Cordelia
Who hath most fortunately been informd
Of my obscured course and shall find time
From this enormous state seeking to give
Losses their remedies All weary and oerwatchd
Take vantage heavy eyes not to behold
This shameful lodging
Fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel
Sleeps
Enter EDGAR
I heard myself proclaimd
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escaped the hunt No port is free no place
That guard and most unusual vigilance
Does not attend my taking Whiles I may scape
I will preserve myself and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury in contempt of man
Brought near to beast my face Ill grime with filth
Blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
And with presented nakedness outface
The winds and persecutions of the sky
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
Strike in their numbd and mortified bare arms
Pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
And with this horrible object from low farms
Poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills
Sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers
Enforce their charity Poor Turlygod poor Tom
Thats something yet Edgar I nothing am
Exit
Enter KING LEAR Fool and Gentleman
Tis strange that they should so depart from home
And not send back my messenger
As I learnd
The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove
Hail to thee noble master
Ha
Makest thou this shame thy pastime
No my lord
Ha ha he wears cruel garters Horses are tied
by the heads dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by
the loins and men by the legs when a mans
overlusty at legs then he wears wooden
netherstocks
Whats he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here
It is both he and she
Your son and daughter
No
Yes
No I say
I say yea
No no they would not
Yes they have
By Jupiter I swear no
By Juno I swear ay
They durst not do t
They could not would not do t tis worse than murder
To do upon respect such violent outrage
Resolve me with all modest haste which way
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
Coming from us
My lord when at their home
I did commend your highness letters to them
Ere I was risen from the place that showd
My duty kneeling came there a reeking post
Stewd in his haste half breathless panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations
Deliverd letters spite of intermission
Which presently they read on whose contents
They summond up their meiny straight took horse
Commanded me to follow and attend
The leisure of their answer gave me cold looks
And meeting here the other messenger
Whose welcome I perceived had poisond mine
Being the very fellow that of late
Displayd so saucily against your highness
Having more man than wit about me drew
He raised the house with loud and coward cries
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers
Winters not gone yet if the wildgeese fly that way
Fathers that wear rags
Do make their children blind
But fathers that bear bags
Shall see their children kind
Fortune that arrant whore
Neer turns the key to the poor
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year
O how this mother swells up toward my heart
Hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow
Thy elements below Where is this daughter
With the earl sir here within
Follow me not
Stay here
Exit
Made you no more offence but what you speak of
None
How chance the king comes with so small a train
And thou hadst been set i the stocks for that
question thou hadst well deserved it
Why fool
Well set thee to school to an ant to teach thee
theres no labouring i the winter All that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and
theres not a nose among twenty but can smell him
thats stinking Let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with
following it but the great one that goes up the
hill let him draw thee after When a wise man
gives thee better counsel give me mine again I
would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
That sir which serves and seeks for gain
And follows but for form
Will pack when it begins to rain
And leave thee in the storm
But I will tarry the fool will stay
And let the wise man fly
The knave turns fool that runs away
The fool no knave perdy
Where learned you this fool
Not i the stocks fool
Reenter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER
Deny to speak with me They are sick they are weary
They have travelld all the night Mere fetches
The images of revolt and flying off
Fetch me a better answer
My dear lord
You know the fiery quality of the duke
How unremoveable and fixd he is
In his own course
Vengeance plague death confusion
Fiery what quality Why Gloucester Gloucester
Ild speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife
Well my good lord I have informd them so
Informd them Dost thou understand me man
Ay my good lord
The king would speak with Cornwall the dear father
Would with his daughter speak commands her service
Are they informd of this My breath and blood
Fiery the fiery duke Tell the hot duke that
No but not yet may be he is not well
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves
When nature being oppressd commands the mind
To suffer with the body Ill forbear
And am falln out with my more headier will
To take the indisposed and sickly fit
For the sound man Death on my state wherefore
Looking on KENT
That this remotion of the duke and her
Go tell the duke and s wife Ild speak with them
Now presently bid them come forth and hear me
Or at their chamberdoor Ill beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death
I would have all well betwixt you
Exit
O me my heart my rising heart but down
Cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels
when she put em i the paste alive she knapped em
o the coxcombs with a stick and cried Down
wantons down Twas her brother that in pure
kindness to his horse buttered his hay
Enter CORNWALL REGAN GLOUCESTER and Servants
Good morrow to you both
Hail to your grace
KENT is set at liberty
I am glad to see your highness
Regan I think you are I know what reason
I have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad
I would divorce me from thy mothers tomb
Sepulchring an adultress
To KENT
O are you free
Some other time for that Beloved Regan
Thy sisters naught O Regan she hath tied
Sharptoothd unkindness like a vulture here
Points to his heart
I can scarce speak to thee thoult not believe
With how depraved a qualityO Regan
I pray you sir take patience I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty
Say how is that
I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation if sir perchance
She have restraind the riots of your followers
Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end
As clears her from all blame
My curses on her
O sir you are old
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine you should be ruled and led
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return
Say you have wrongd her sir
Ask her forgiveness
Do you but mark how this becomes the house
Dear daughter I confess that I am old
Kneeling
Age is unnecessary on my knees I beg
That youll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food
Good sir no more these are unsightly tricks
Return you to my sister
Rising  Never Regan
She hath abated me of half my train
Lookd black upon me struck me with her tongue
Most serpentlike upon the very heart
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top Strike her young bones
You taking airs with lameness
Fie sir fie
You nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes Infect her beauty
You fensuckd fogs drawn by the powerful sun
To fall and blast her pride
O the blest gods so will you wish on me
When the rash mood is on
No Regan thou shalt never have my curse
Thy tenderhefted nature shall not give
Thee oer to harshness her eyes are fierce but thine
Do comfort and not burn Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures to cut off my train
To bandy hasty words to scant my sizes
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in thou better knowst
The offices of nature bond of childhood
Effects of courtesy dues of gratitude
Thy half o the kingdom hast thou not forgot
Wherein I thee endowd
Good sir to the purpose
Who put my man i the stocks
Tucket within
What trumpets that
I knowt my sisters this approves her letter
That she would soon be here
Enter OSWALD
Is your lady come
This is a slave whose easyborrowd pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows
Out varlet from my sight
What means your grace
Who stockd my servant Regan I have good hope
Thou didst not know ont Who comes here O heavens
Enter GONERIL
If you do love old men if your sweet sway
Allow obedience if yourselves are old
Make it your cause send down and take my part
To GONERIL
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard
O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand
Why not by the hand sir How have I offended
Alls not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so
O sides you are too tough
Will you yet hold How came my man i the stocks
I set him there sir but his own disorders
Deserved much less advancement
You did you
I pray you father being weak seem so
If till the expiration of your month
You will return and sojourn with my sister
Dismissing half your train come then to me
I am now from home and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment
Return to her and fifty men dismissd
No rather I abjure all roofs and choose
To wage against the enmity o the air
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl
Necessitys sharp pinch Return with her
Why the hotblooded France that dowerless took
Our youngest born I could as well be brought
To knee his throne and squirelike pension beg
To keep base life afoot Return with her
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom
Pointing at OSWALD
At your choice sir
I prithee daughter do not make me mad
I will not trouble thee my child farewell
Well no more meet no more see one another
But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
Or rather a disease thats in my flesh
Which I must needs call mine thou art a boil
A plaguesore an embossed carbuncle
In my corrupted blood But Ill not chide thee
Let shame come when it will I do not call it
I do not bid the thunderbearer shoot
Nor tell tales of thee to highjudging Jove
Mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
I can be patient I can stay with Regan
I and my hundred knights
Not altogether so
I lookd not for you yet nor am provided
For your fit welcome Give ear sir to my sister
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old and so
But she knows what she does
Is this well spoken
I dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
Is it not well What should you need of more
Yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
Speak gainst so great a number How in one house
Should many people under two commands
Hold amity Tis hard almost impossible
Why might not you my lord receive attendance
From those that she calls servants or from mine
Why not my lord If then they chanced to slack you
We could control them If you will come to me
For now I spy a dangerI entreat you
To bring but five and twenty to no more
Will I give place or notice
I gave you all
And in good time you gave it
Made you my guardians my depositaries
But kept a reservation to be followd
With such a number What must I come to you
With five and twenty Regan said you so
And speakt again my lord no more with me
Those wicked creatures yet do look wellfavourd
When others are more wicked not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise
To GONERIL
Ill go with thee
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty
And thou art twice her love
Hear me my lord
What need you five and twenty ten or five
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you
What need one
O reason not the need our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous
Allow not nature more than nature needs
Mans lifes as cheap as beasts thou art a lady
If only to go warm were gorgeous
Why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wearst
Which scarcely keeps thee warm But for true need
You heavens give me that patience patience I need
You see me here you gods a poor old man
As full of grief as age wretched in both
If it be you that stir these daughters hearts
Against their father fool me not so much
To bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
And let not womens weapons waterdrops
Stain my mans cheeks No you unnatural hags
I will have such revenges on you both
That all the world shallI will do such things
What they are yet I know not but they shall be
The terrors of the earth You think Ill weep
No Ill not weep
I have full cause of weeping but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Or ere Ill weep O fool I shall go mad
Exeunt KING LEAR GLOUCESTER KENT and Fool
Storm and tempest
Let us withdraw twill be a storm
This house is little the old man and his people
Cannot be well bestowd
Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest
And must needs taste his folly
For his particular Ill receive him gladly
But not one follower
So am I purposed
Where is my lord of Gloucester
Followd the old man forth he is returnd
Reenter GLOUCESTER
The king is in high rage
Whither is he going
He calls to horse but will I know not whither
Tis best to give him way he leads himself
My lord entreat him by no means to stay
Alack the night comes on and the bleak winds
Do sorely ruffle for many miles a bout
Theres scarce a bush
O sir to wilful men
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors
He is attended with a desperate train
And what they may incense him to being apt
To have his ear abused wisdom bids fear
Shut up your doors my lord tis a wild night
My Regan counsels well come out o the storm
Exeunt
Storm still Enter KENT and a Gentleman meeting
Whos there besides foul weather
One minded like the weather most unquietly
I know you Wheres the king
Contending with the fretful element
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea
Or swell the curled water bove the main
That things might change or cease tears his white hair
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
Catch in their fury and make nothing of
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
The toandfroconflicting wind and rain
This night wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch
The lion and the bellypinched wolf
Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
And bids what will take all
But who is with him
None but the fool who labours to outjest
His heartstruck injuries
Sir I do know you
And dare upon the warrant of my note
Commend a dear thing to you There is division
Although as yet the face of it be coverd
With mutual cunning twixt Albany and Cornwall
Who haveas who have not that their great stars
Throned and set highservants who seem no less
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state what hath been seen
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind king or something deeper
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings
But true it is from France there comes a power
Into this scatterd kingdom who already
Wise in our negligence have secret feet
In some of our best ports and are at point
To show their open banner Now to you
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover you shall find
Some that will thank you making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The king hath cause to plain
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding
And from some knowledge and assurance offer
This office to you
I will talk further with you
No do not
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my outwall open this purse and take
What it contains If you shall see Cordelia
As fear not but you shallshow her this ring
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know Fie on this storm
I will go seek the king
Give me your hand have you no more to say
Few words but to effect more than all yet
That when we have found the kingin which your pain
That way Ill thishe that first lights on him
Holla the other
Exeunt severally
Enter KING LEAR and Fool
Blow winds and crack your cheeks rage blow
Till you have drenchd our steeples drownd the cocks
You sulphurous and thoughtexecuting fires
Vauntcouriers to oakcleaving thunderbolts
Singe my white head And thou allshaking thunder
Smite flat the thick rotundity o the world
Crack natures moulds an germens spill at once
That make ingrateful man
O nuncle court holywater in a dry
house is better than this rainwater out o door
Good nuncle in and ask thy daughters blessing
heres a night pities neither wise man nor fool
Rumble thy bellyful Spit fire spout rain
Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters
I tax not you you elements with unkindness
I never gave you kingdom calld you children
You owe me no subscription then let fall
Your horrible pleasure here I stand your slave
A poor infirm weak and despised old man
But yet I call you servile ministers
That have with two pernicious daughters joind
Your high engenderd battles gainst a head
So old and white as this O O tis foul
He that has a house to puts head in has a good
headpiece
The codpiece that will house
Before the head has any
The head and he shall louse
So beggars marry many
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall of a corn cry woe
And turn his sleep to wake
For there was never yet fair woman but she made
mouths in a glass
No I will be the pattern of all patience
I will say nothing
Enter KENT
Whos there
Marry heres grace and a codpiece thats a wise
man and a fool
Alas sir are you here things that love night
Love not such nights as these the wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
And make them keep their caves since I was man
Such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
Remember to have heard mans nature cannot carry
The affliction nor the fear
Let the great gods
That keep this dreadful pother oer our heads
Find out their enemies now Tremble thou wretch
That hast within thee undivulged crimes
Unwhippd of justice hide thee thou bloody hand
Thou perjured and thou simular man of virtue
That art incestuous caitiff to pieces shake
That under covert and convenient seeming
Rive your concealing continents and cry
These dreadful summoners grace I am a man
More sinnd against than sinning
Alack bareheaded
Gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel
Some friendship will it lend you gainst the tempest
Repose you there while I to this hard house
More harder than the stones whereof tis raised
Which even but now demanding after you
Denied me to come inreturn and force
Their scanted courtesy
My wits begin to turn
Come on my boy how dost my boy art cold
I am cold myself Where is this straw my fellow
The art of our necessities is strange
That can make vile things precious Come
your hovel
Poor fool and knave I have one part in my heart
Thats sorry yet for thee
Singing
He that has and a little tiny wit
With hey ho the wind and the rain
Must make content with his fortunes fit
For the rain it raineth every day
True my good boy Come bring us to this hovel
Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan
Ill speak a prophecy ere I go
When priests are more in word than matter
When brewers mar their malt with water
When nobles are their tailors tutors
No heretics burnd but wenches suitors
When every case in law is right
No squire in debt nor no poor knight
When slanders do not live in tongues
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs
When usurers tell their gold i the field
And bawds and whores do churches build
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion
Then comes the time who lives to seet
That going shall be used with feet
This prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before his time
Exit
Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
Alack alack Edmund I like not this unnatural
dealing When I desire their leave that I might
pity him they took from me the use of mine own
house charged me on pain of their perpetual
displeasure neither to speak of him entreat for
him nor any way sustain him
Most savage and unnatural
Go to say you nothing Theres a division betwixt
the dukes and a worse matter than that I have
received a letter this night tis dangerous to be
spoken I have locked the letter in my closet
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
home theres part of a power already footed we
must incline to the king I will seek him and
privily relieve him go you and maintain talk with
the duke that my charity be not of him perceived
if he ask for me I am ill and gone to bed
Though I die for it as no less is threatened me
the king my old master must be relieved There is
some strange thing toward Edmund pray you be careful
Exit
This courtesy forbid thee shall the duke
Instantly know and of that letter too
This seems a fair deserving and must draw me
That which my father loses no less than all
The younger rises when the old doth fall
Exit
Enter KING LEAR KENT and Fool
Here is the place my lord good my lord enter
The tyranny of the open nights too rough
For nature to endure
Storm still
Let me alone
Good my lord enter here
Wilt break my heart
I had rather break mine own Good my lord enter
Thou thinkst tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin so tis to thee
But where the greater malady is fixd
The lesser is scarce felt Thouldst shun a bear
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea
Thouldst meet the bear i the mouth When the
minds free
The bodys delicate the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there Filial ingratitude
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food tot But I will punish home
No I will weep no more In such a night
To shut me out Pour on I will endure
In such a night as this O Regan Goneril
Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all
O that way madness lies let me shun that
No more of that
Good my lord enter here
Prithee go in thyself seek thine own ease
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me more But Ill go in
To the Fool
In boy go first You houseless poverty
Nay get thee in Ill pray and then Ill sleep
Fool goes in
Poor naked wretches wheresoer you are
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides
Your loopd and windowd raggedness defend you
From seasons such as these O I have taen
Too little care of this Take physic pomp
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
And show the heavens more just
Within  Fathom and half fathom and half Poor Tom
The Fool runs out from the hovel
Come not in here nuncle heres a spirit
Help me help me
Give me thy hand Whos there
A spirit a spirit he says his names poor Tom
What art thou that dost grumble there i the straw
Come forth
Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man
Away the foul fiend follows me
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind
Hum go to thy cold bed and warm thee
Hast thou given all to thy two daughters
And art thou come to this

fiend hath led through fire and through flame and
through ford and whirlipool eer bog and quagmire

What have his daughters brought him to this pass
Couldst thou save nothing Didst thou give them all
Nay he reserved a blanket else we had been all shamed
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Hang fated oer mens faults light on thy daughters
He hath no daughters sir
Death traitor nothing could have subdued nature
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh
Judicious punishment twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters
Pillicock sat on Pillicockhill
Halloo halloo loo loo
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen
Take heed o the foul fiend obey thy parents
keep thy word justly swear not commit not with
mans sworn spouse set not thy sweet heart on proud
array Toms acold
What hast thou been
A servingman proud in heart and mind that curled
my hair wore gloves in my cap served the lust of
her swore as many oaths as I spake words and
broke them in the sweet face of heaven one that
slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it
wine loved I deeply dice dearly and in woman
outparamoured the Turk false of heart light of
ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox in stealth
wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
silks betray thy poor heart to woman keep thy foot
out of brothels thy hand out of plackets thy pen
from lenders books and defy the foul fiend
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind
Says suum mun ha no nonny
Dolphin my boy my boy sessa let him trot by

Why thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies
Is man no more than this Consider him well Thou

unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare
forked animal as thou art Off off you lendings

Tearing off his clothes
Prithee nuncle be contented tis a naughty night

This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet he begins
at curfew and walks till the first cock he gives

Poor Tom that eats the swimming frog the toad
the tadpole the wallnewt and the water that in
the fury of his heart when the foul fiend rages

the ditchdog drinks the green mantle of the
standing pool who is whipped from tithing to
tithing and stock punished and imprisoned who
hath had three suits to his back six shirts to his
body horse to ride and weapon to wear
But mice and rats and such small deer
Have been Toms food for seven long year
Beware my follower Peace Smulkin peace thou fiend
What hath your grace no better company
The prince of darkness is a gentleman
Modo hes calld and Mahu
Our flesh and blood is grown so vile my lord
That it doth hate what gets it
Poor Toms acold
Go in with me my duty cannot suffer
To obey in all your daughters hard commands
Though their injunction be to bar my doors
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out
And bring you where both fire and food is ready
First let me talk with this philosopher
What is the cause of thunder
Good my lord take his offer go into the house
Ill talk a word with this same learned Theban
What is your study
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin
Let me ask you one word in private
Importune him once more to go my lord
His wits begin to unsettle
Canst thou blame him
Storm still
His daughters seek his death ah that good Kent
He said it would be thus poor banishd man
Thou sayst the king grows mad Ill tell thee friend
I am almost mad myself I had a son
Now outlawd from my blood he sought my life
But lately very late I loved him friend

I smell the blood of a British man
Exeunt
Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house
How my lord I may be censured that nature thus
gives way to loyalty something fears me to think
of
I now perceive it was not altogether your
brothers evil disposition made him seek his death
but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable
badness in himself
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to
be just This is the letter he spoke of which
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
of France O heavens that this treason were not
or not I the detector
o with me to the duchess
If the matter of this paper be certain you have
mighty business in hand
True or false it hath made thee earl of
Gloucester Seek out where thy father is that he
may be ready for our apprehension
Aside  If I find him comforting the king it will
stuff his suspicion more fullyI will persevere in
my course of loyalty though the conflict be sore
between that and my blood
I will lay trust upon thee and thou shalt find a
dearer father in my love
Exeunt
Enter GLOUCESTER KING LEAR KENT Fool and EDGAR

impatience the gods reward your kindness
Exit GLOUCESTER
Frateretto calls me and tells me
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness
Pray innocent and beware the foul fiend
Prithee nuncle tell me whether a madman be a
gentleman or a yeoman
A king a king
No hes a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son
for hes a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
before him
To have a thousand with red burning spits
Come hissing in upon em
The foul fiend bites my back
Hes mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf a
horses health a boys love or a whores oath
It shall be done I will arraign them straight

Thou sapient sir sit here Now you she foxes
Look where he stands and glares
Wantest thou eyes at trial madam

Why she dares not come over to thee
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
nightingale Hopdance cries in Toms belly for two

food for thee
How do you sir Stand you not so amazed
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions

False justicer why hast thou let her scape
Bless thy five wits
O pity Sir where is the patience now
That thou so oft have boasted to retain
Aside  My tears begin to take his part so much
Theyll mar my counterfeiting
The little dogs and all Tray Blanch and
Sweetheart see they bark at me
Tom will throw his head at them Avaunt you curs
Be thy mouth or black or white
Tooth that poisons if it bite
Mastiff greyhound mongrel grim
Hound or spaniel brach or lym
Or bobtail tike or trundletail
Tom will make them weep and wail
For with throwing thus my head
Dogs leap the hatch and all are fled
Do de de de Sessa Come march to wakes and
fairs and markettowns Poor Tom thy horn is dry
Then let them anatomize Regan see what breeds
about her heart Is there any cause in nature that
makes these hard hearts
To EDGAR
You sir I entertain for one of my hundred only I
do not like the fashion of your garments you will
say they are Persian attire but let them be changed
Now good my lord lie here and rest awhile
Make no noise make no noise draw the curtains

And Ill go to bed at noon
Reenter GLOUCESTER
Come hither friend where is the king my master

Both welcome and protection Take up thy master
If thou shouldst dally half an hour his life
With thine and all that offer to defend him
Stand in assured loss take up take up
And follow me that will to some provision
Give thee quick conduct
Oppressed nature sleeps
This rest might yet have balmd thy broken senses
Which if convenience will not allow
Stand in hard cure
To the Fool
Come help to bear thy master
Thou must not stay behind
Come come away
Exeunt all but EDGAR
When we our betters see bearing our woes
We scarcely think our miseries our foes
Who alone suffers suffers most i the mind
Leaving free things and happy shows behind
But then the mind much sufferance doth oer skip
When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
How light and portable my pain seems now
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow
He childed as I fatherd Tom away
Mark the high noises and thyself bewray
When false opinion whose wrong thought defiles thee
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee
What will hap more tonight safe scape the king
Lurk lurk

Naughty lady
These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
Will quicken and accuse thee I am your host
With robbers hands my hospitable favours
You should not ruffle thus What will you do
Come sir what letters had you late from France
Be simple answerer for we know the truth
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king Speak
I have a letter guessingly set down
Which came from one thats of a neutral heart
And not from one opposed
Cunning
And false
Where hast thou sent the king
To Dover
Wherefore to Dover Wast thou not charged at peril
Wherefore to Dover Let him first answer that
I am tied to the stake and I must stand the course
Wherefore to Dover sir
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs
The sea with such a storm as his bare head
In hellblack night endured would have buoyd up
And quenchd the stelled fires
Yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain
If wolves had at thy gate howld that stern time
Thou shouldst have said Good porter turn the key
All cruels else subscribed but I shall see
The winged vengeance overtake such children
Seet shalt thou never Fellows hold the chair
Upon these eyes of thine Ill set my foot
He that will think to live till he be old
Give me some help O cruel O you gods
One side will mock another the other too
If you see vengeance
Hold your hand my lord
I have served you ever since I was a child
But better service have I never done you
Than now to bid you hold
How now you dog
If you did wear a beard upon your chin
Id shake it on this quarrel What do you mean
My villain
They draw and fight
Nay then come on and take the chance of anger
Give me thy sword A peasant stand up thus
Takes a sword and runs at him behind

Dies

Where is thy lustre now
All dark and comfortless Wheres my son Edmund
Edmund enkindle all the sparks of nature
Out treacherous villain
Thou callst on him that hates thee it was he

Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell
His way to Dover

Allows itself to any thing
Go thou Ill fetch some flax and whites of eggs
To apply to his bleeding face Now heaven help him
Exeunt severally

Owes nothing to thy blasts But who comes here

My father poorly led World world O world

So long as we can say  This is the worst
Fellow where goest

Madman and beggar too
He has some reason else he could not beg
I the last nights storm I such a fellow saw
Which made me think a man a worm my son
Came then into my mind and yet my mind
Was then scarce friends with him I have heard
more since
As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods
They kill us for their sport
AsideHow should this be
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow
Angering itself and othersBless thee master

Ay my lord
Then prithee get thee gone if for my sake
Thou wilt oertake us hence a mile or twain

And bring some covering for this naked soul

Here take this purse thou whom the heavens plagues

So distribution should undo excess
And each man have enough Dost thou know Dover

With something rich about me from that place

Poor Tom shall lead thee
Exeunt
Enter GONERIL and EDMUND
Welcome my lord I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way
Enter OSWALD
Now wheres your master
Madam within but never man so changed
I told him of the army that was landed
He smiled at it I told him you were coming
His answer was The worse of Gloucesters treachery
And of the loyal service of his son
When I informd him then he calld me sot
And told me I had turnd the wrong side out
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him
What like offensive
To EDMUND  Then shall you go no further
It is the cowish terror of his spirit
That dares not undertake hell not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer Our wishes on the way
May prove effects Back Edmund to my brother
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers
I must change arms at home and give the distaff
Into my husbands hands This trusty servant
Shall pass between us ere long you are like to hear
If you dare venture in your own behalf
A mistresss command Wear this spare speech
Giving a favour
Decline your head this kiss if it durst speak
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air
Conceive and fare thee well
Yours in the ranks of death
My most dear Gloucester
Exit EDMUND
O the difference of man and man
To thee a womans services are due
My fool usurps my body
Madam here comes my lord
Exit
Enter ALBANY
I have been worth the whistle
O Goneril
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face I fear your disposition
That nature which contemns its origin
Cannot be borderd certain in itself
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap perforce must wither
And come to deadly use
No more the text is foolish
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
Filths savour but themselves What have you done
Tigers not daughters what have you performd
A father and a gracious aged man
Whose reverence even the headluggd bear would lick
Most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
Could my good brother suffer you to do it
A man a prince by him so benefited
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences
It will come
Humanity must perforce prey on itself
Like monsters of the deep
Milkliverd man
That bearst a cheek for blows a head for wrongs
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering that not knowst
Fools do those villains pity who are punishd
Ere they have done their mischief Wheres thy drum
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats
Whiles thou a moral fool sitst still and criest
Alack why does he so
See thyself devil
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman
O vain fool
Thou changed and selfcoverd thing for shame
Bemonster not thy feature Weret my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones howeer thou art a fiend
A womans shape doth shield thee
Marry your manhood now
Enter a Messenger
What news
O my good lord the Duke of Cornwalls dead
Slain by his servant going to put out
The other eye of Gloucester
Gloucesters eye
A servant that he bred thrilld with remorse
To his great master who thereat enraged
Flew on him and amongst them felld him dead
But not without that harmful stroke which since
Hath pluckd him after
This shows you are above
You justicers that these our nether crimes
So speedily can venge But O poor Gloucester
Lost he his other eye
Both both my lord
This letter madam craves a speedy answer
Tis from your sister
Aside              One way I like this well
But being widow and my Gloucester with her
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life another way
The news is not so tartIll read and answer
Exit
Where was his son when they did take his eyes
Come with my lady hither
He is not here
No my good lord I met him back again
Knows he the wickedness
Ay my good lord twas he informd against him
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment
Might have the freer course
Gloucester I live
To thank thee for the love thou showdst the king
And to revenge thine eyes Come hither friend
Tell me what more thou knowst
Exeunt
Enter KENT and a Gentleman
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
know you the reason
Something he left imperfect in the
state which since his coming forth is thought
of which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger that his personal return was
most required and necessary
Who hath he left behind him general
The Marshal of France Monsieur La Far
Did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief
Ay sir she took them read them in my presence
And now and then an ample tear trilld down
Her delicate cheek it seemd she was a queen
Over her passion who most rebellike
Sought to be king oer her
O then it moved her
Not to a rage patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
Were like a better way those happy smilets
That playd on her ripe lip seemd not to know
What guests were in her eyes which parted thence
As pearls from diamonds droppd In brief
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved
If all could so become it
Made she no verbal question
Faith once or twice she heaved the name of father
Pantingly forth as if it pressd her heart
Cried Sisters sisters Shame of ladies sisters
Kent father sisters What i the storm i the night
Let pity not be believed There she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes
And clamour moistend then away she started
To deal with grief alone
It is the stars
The stars above us govern our conditions
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues You spoke not with her since
No
Was this before the king returnd
No since
Well sir the poor distressed Lears i the town
Who sometime in his better tune remembers
What we are come about and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter
Why good sir
A sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness
That strippd her from his benediction turnd her
To foreign casualties gave her dear rights
To his doghearted daughters these things sting
His mind so venomously that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia
Alack poor gentleman
Of Albanys and Cornwalls powers you heard not
Tis so they are afoot
Well sir Ill bring you to our master Lear
And leave you to attend him some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile
When I am known aright you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance I pray you go
Along with me
Exeunt
Enter with drum and colours CORDELIA Doctor and Soldiers
Alack tis he why he was met even now
As mad as the vexd sea singing aloud
Crownd with rank fumiter and furrowweeds
With burdocks hemlock nettles cuckooflowers
Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn A century send forth
Search every acre in the highgrown field
And bring him to our eye
Exit an Officer
What can mans wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense
He that helps him take all my outward worth
There is means madam
Our fosternurse of nature is repose
The which he lacks that to provoke in him
Are many simples operative whose power
Will close the eye of anguish
All blest secrets
All you unpublishd virtues of the earth
Spring with my tears be aidant and remediate
In the good mans distress Seek seek for him
Lest his ungovernd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it
Enter a Messenger
News madam
The British powers are marching hitherward
Tis known before our preparation stands
In expectation of them O dear father
It is thy business that I go about
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied
No blown ambition doth our arms incite
But love dear love and our aged fathers right
Soon may I hear and see him
Exeunt
Enter REGAN and OSWALD
But are my brothers powers set forth
Ay madam
Himself in person there
Madam with much ado
Your sister is the better soldier
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home
No madam
What might import my sisters letter to him
I know not lady
Faith he is posted hence on serious matter
It was great ignorance Gloucesters eyes being out
To let him live where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us Edmund I think is gone
In pity of his misery to dispatch
His nighted life moreover to descry
The strength o the enemy
I must needs after him madam with my letter
Our troops set forth tomorrow stay with us
The ways are dangerous
I may not madam
My lady charged my duty in this business
Why should she write to Edmund Might not you
Transport her purposes by word Belike
SomethingI know not what Ill love thee much
Let me unseal the letter
Madam I had rather
I know your lady does not love her husband
I am sure of that and at her late being here
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund I know you are of her bosom
I madam
I speak in understanding you are I knowt
Therefore I do advise you take this note
My lord is dead Edmund and I have talkd
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your ladys you may gather more
If you do find him pray you give him this
And when your mistress hears thus much from you
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her
So fare you well
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off
Would I could meet him madam I should show
What party I do follow
Fare thee well
Exeunt
Enter GLOUCESTER and EDGAR dressed like a peasant
When shall we come to the top of that same hill
You do climb up it now look how we labour
Methinks the ground is even
Horrible steep
Hark do you hear the sea
No truly
Why then your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes anguish
So may it be indeed
Methinks thy voice is alterd and thou speakst
In better phrase and matter than thou didst
Youre much deceived in nothing am I changed
But in my garments
Methinks youre better spoken
Come on sir heres the place stand still How fearful
And dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head
The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
Diminishd to her cock her cock a buoy
Almost too small for sight the murmuring surge
That on the unnumberd idle pebbles chafes
Cannot be heard so high Ill look no more
Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong
Set me where you stand
Give me your hand you are now within a foot
Of the extreme verge for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright
Let go my hand
Here friend s another purse in it a jewel
Well worth a poor mans taking fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee Go thou farther off
Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going
Now fare you well good sir
With all my heart
Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it
Kneeling  O you mighty gods
This world I do renounce and in your sights
Shake patiently my great affliction off
If I could bear it longer and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out If Edgar live O bless him
Now fellow fare thee well
He falls forward
Gone sir farewell
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life when life itself
Yields to the theft had he been where he thought
By this had thought been past Alive or dead
Ho you sir friend Hear you sir speak
Thus might he pass indeed yet he revives
What are you sir
Away and let me die
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air
So many fathom down precipitating
Thoudst shiverd like an egg but thou dost breathe
Hast heavy substance bleedst not speakst art sound
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell
Thy lifes a miracle Speak yet again
But have I falln or no
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn
Look up aheight the shrillgorged lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard do but look up
Alack I have no eyes
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit
To end itself by death Twas yet some comfort
When misery could beguile the tyrants rage
And frustrate his proud will
Give me your arm
Up so How is t Feel you your legs You stand
Too well too well
This is above all strangeness
Upon the crown o the cliff what thing was that
Which parted from you
A poor unfortunate beggar
As I stood here below methought his eyes
Were two full moons he had a thousand noses
Horns whelkd and waved like the enridged sea
It was some fiend therefore thou happy father
Think that the clearest gods who make them honours
Of mens impossibilities have preserved thee
I do remember now henceforth Ill bear
Affliction till it do cry out itself
Enough enough and die That thing you speak of
I took it for a man often twould say
The fiend the fiend he led me to that place
Bear free and patient thoughts But who comes here
Enter KING LEAR fantastically dressed with wild flowers
The safer sense will neer accommodate
His master thus

I pardon that mans life What was thy cause Adultery
Thou shalt not die die for adultery No

Behold yond simpering dame
Whose face between her forks presages snow
That minces virtue and does shake the head
To hear of pleasures name
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to t
With a more riotous appetite
Down from the waist they are Centaurs
Though women all above
But to the girdle do the gods inherit
Beneath is all the fiends

What with the case of eyes
O ho are you there with me No eyes in your
head nor no money in your purse Your eyes are in

thine ear change places and handydandy which
is the justice which is the thief Thou hast seen
a farmers dog bark at a beggar
Ay sir
And the creature run from the cur There thou
mightst behold the great image of authority a
dogs obeyed in office
Thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
Why dost thou lash that whore Strip thine own back
Thou hotly lustst to use her in that kind
For which thou whippst her The usurer hangs the cozener
Through tatterd clothes small vices do appear
Robes and furrd gowns hide all Plate sin with gold
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks
Arm it in rags a pigmys straw does pierce it
None does offend none I say none Ill able em
Take that of me my friend who have the power
To seal the accusers lips Get thee glass eyes
And like a scurvy politician seem
To see the things thou dost not Now now now now
Pull off my boots harder harder so

If thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes

Thou must be patient we came crying hither
Thou knowst the first time that we smell the air
We wawl and cry I will preach to thee mark
Alack alack the day

Of murderous lechers and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight

So should my thoughts be severd from my griefs
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves

Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum
Come father Ill bestow you with a friend
Exeunt
soft music playing Gentleman and others attending
Enter CORDELIA KENT and Doctor
O thou good Kent how shall I live and work
To match thy goodness My life will be too short
And every measure fail me
To be acknowledged madam is oerpaid
All my reports go with the modest truth
Nor more nor clippd but so
Be better suited
These weeds are memories of those worser hours
I prithee put them off
Pardon me dear madam
Yet to be known shortens my made intent
My boon I make it that you know me not
Till time and I think meet
Then bet so my good lord
To the Doctor
How does the king
Madam sleeps still
O you kind gods
Cure this great breach in his abused nature
The untuned and jarring senses O wind up
Of this childchanged father
So please your majesty
That we may wake the king he hath slept long
Be governd by your knowledge and proceed
I the sway of your own will Is he arrayd
Ay madam in the heaviness of his sleep
We put fresh garments on him
Be by good madam when we do awake him
I doubt not of his temperance
Very well
Please you draw near Louder the music there
O my dear father Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made
Kind and dear princess
Had you not been their father these white flakes
Had challenged pity of them Was this a face
To be opposed against the warring winds
To stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick cross lightning to watchpoor perdu
With this thin helm Mine enemys dog
Though he had bit me should have stood that night
Against my fire and wast thou fain poor father
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
In short and musty straw Alack alack
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all He wakes speak to him
Madam do you tis fittest
How does my royal lord How fares your majesty
You do me wrong to take me out o the grave
Thou art a soul in bliss but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears
Do scald like moulten lead
Sir do you know me
You are a spirit I know when did you die
Still still far wide
Hes scarce awake let him alone awhile
Where have I been Where am I Fair daylight
I am mightily abused I should een die with pity
To see another thus I know not what to say
I will not swear these are my hands lets see
I feel this pin prick Would I were assured
Of my condition
O look upon me sir
And hold your hands in benediction oer me
No sir you must not kneel
Pray do not mock me
I am a very foolish fond old man
Fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less
And to deal plainly
I fear I am not in my perfect mind
Methinks I should know you and know this man
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night Do not laugh at me
For as I am a man I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia
And so I am I am
Be your tears wet yes faith I pray weep not
If you have poison for me I will drink it
I know you do not love me for your sisters
Have as I do remember done me wrong
You have some cause they have not
No cause no cause
Am I in France
In your own kingdom sir
Do not abuse me
Be comforted good madam the great rage
You see is killd in him and yet it is danger
To make him even oer the time he has lost
Desire him to go in trouble him no more
Till further settling
Willt please your highness walk
You must bear with me
Pray you now forget and forgive I am old and foolish

Exit
To both these sisters have I sworn my love
Each jealous of the other as the stung
Are of the adder Which of them shall I take
Both one or neither Neither can be enjoyd
If both remain alive to take the widow
Exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril
And hardly shall I carry out my side
Her husband being alive Now then well use
His countenance for the battle which being done
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia
The battle done and they within our power
Shall never see his pardon for my state
Stands on me to defend not to debate

Some officers take them away good guard
Until their greater pleasures first be known

Who with best meaning have incurrd the worst
For thee oppressed king am I cast down
Myself could else outfrown false fortunes frown
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters
No no no no Come lets away to prison
We two alone will sing like birds i the cage
When thou dost ask me blessing Ill kneel down
And ask of thee forgiveness so well live
And pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh
At gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news and well talk with them too
Who loses and who wins whos in whos out
And take upons the mystery of things
As if we were Gods spies and well wear out
In a walld prison packs and sects of great ones
That ebb and flow by the moon
Take them away
Upon such sacrifices my Cordelia
The gods themselves throw incense Have I caught thee
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
And fire us hence like foxes Wipe thine eyes
The goodyears shall devour them flesh and fell
Ere they shall make us weep well see em starve

Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA guarded
Come hither captain hark

Exit
Flourish Enter ALBANY GONERIL REGAN another Captain and Soldiers
Sir you have shown today your valiant strain
And fortune led you well you have the captives
That were the opposites of this days strife
We do require them of you so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine
Sir I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention and appointed guard
Whose age has charms in it whose title more
To pluck the common bosom on his side
An turn our impressd lances in our eyes
Which do command them With him I sent the queen
My reason all the same and they are ready
Tomorrow or at further space to appear
Where you shall hold your session At this time
We sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
And the best quarrels in the heat are cursed
By those that feel their sharpness
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place
Sir by your patience
I hold you but a subject of this war
Not as a brother
Thats as we list to grace him
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
Ere you had spoke so far He led our powers
Bore the commission of my place and person
The which immediacy may well stand up
And call itself your brother
Not so hot
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
More than in your addition
In my rights
By me invested he compeers the best
That were the most if he should husband you
Jesters do oft prove prophets
Holla holla
That eye that told you so lookd but asquint
Lady I am not well else I should answer
From a fullflowing stomach General
Take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony
Dispose of them of me the walls are thine
Witness the world that I create thee here
My lord and master
Mean you to enjoy him
The letalone lies not in your good will
Nor in thine lord
Halfblooded fellow yes
To EDMUND  Let the drum strike and prove my title thine
Stay yet hear reason Edmund I arrest thee
On capital treason and in thine attaint
This gilded serpent
Pointing to Goneril
For your claim fair sister
I bar it in the interest of my wife
And I her husband contradict your bans
If you will marry make your loves to me
My lady is bespoke
An interlude
Thou art armd Gloucester let the trumpet sound
If none appear to prove upon thy head
Thy heinous manifest and many treasons
There is my pledge
Throwing down a glove
Ill prove it on thy heart
Ere I taste bread thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaimd thee
Sick O sick
Aside  If not Ill neer trust medicine
Theres my exchange
Throwing down a glove
what in the world he is
That names me traitor villainlike he lies
Call by thy trumpet he that dares approach
On him on you who not I will maintain
My truth and honour firmly
A herald ho

Trust to thy single virtue for thy soldiers
All levied in my name have in my name
Took their discharge

She is not well convey her to  my tent
Exit Regan led
Enter a Herald
Come hither heraldLet the trumpet sound
And read out this
Sound trumpet
A trumpet sounds
Reads  If any man of quality or degree within
the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund
supposed Earl of Gloucester that he is a manifold
traitor let him appear by the third sound of the
trumpet he is bold in his defence
Sound
First trumpet
Again
Second trumpet
Again
Third trumpet
Trumpet answers within
Enter EDGAR at the third sound armed with a trumpet before him
Ask him his purposes why he appears
Upon this call o the trumpet
What are you
Your name your quality and why you answer
This present summons
Know my name is lost
By treasons tooth baregnawn and cankerbit
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope
Which is that adversary
Whats he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester
Himself what sayst thou to him
Draw thy sword
That if my speech offend a noble heart
Thy arm may do thee justice here is mine
Behold it is the privilege of mine honours
My oath and my profession I protest
Maugre thy strength youth place and eminence
Despite thy victor sword and firenew fortune
Thy valour and thy heart thou art a traitor
False to thy gods thy brother and thy father
Conspirant gainst this highillustrious prince
And from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust below thy foot
A most toadspotted traitor Say thou No
This sword this arm and my best spirits are bent
To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak
Thou liest
In wisdom I should ask thy name
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood I disdain and spurn
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head
With the hellhated lie oerwhelm thy heart
Which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise
This sword of mine shall give them instant way
Where they shall rest for ever Trumpets speak
Alarums They fight EDMUND falls
Save him save him
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite thou art not vanquishd
But cozend and beguiled
Shut your mouth dame
Or with this paper shall I stop it Hold sir
Thou worse than any name read thine own evil
No tearing lady I perceive you know it
Gives the letter to EDMUND
Say if I do the laws are mine not thine
Who can arraign me fort
Most monstrous oh
Knowst thou this paper
Ask me not what I know
Exit
Go after her shes desperate govern her
What you have charged me with that have I done
And more much more the time will bring it out
Tis past and so am I But what art thou
That hast this fortune on me If thourt noble
I do forgive thee
Lets exchange charity
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund
If more the more thou hast wrongd me
My name is Edgar and thy fathers son
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes
Thou hast spoken right tis true
The wheel is come full circle I am here
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness I must embrace thee
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father
Worthy prince I knowt
Where have you hid yourself
How have you known the miseries of your father
By nursing them my lord List a brief tale
And when tis told O that my heart would burst
The bloody proclamation to escape
That followd me so nearO our lives sweetness
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at oncetaught me to shift
Into a madmans rags to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdaind and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings
Their precious stones new lost became his guide
Led him beggd for him saved him from despair
NeverO faultreveald myself unto him
Until some halfhour past when I was armd
Not sure though hoping of this good success
I askd his blessing and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage but his flawd heart
Alack too weak the conflict to support
Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
Burst smilingly
This speech of yours hath moved me
And shall perchance do good but speak you on
You look as you had something more to say
If there be more more woeful hold it in
For I am almost ready to dissolve
Hearing of this
This would have seemd a period
To such as love not sorrow but another
To amplify too much would make much more
And top extremity
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man
Who having seen me in my worst estate
Shunnd my abhorrd society but then finding
Who twas that so endured with his strong arms
He fastened on my neck and bellowd out
As held burst heaven threw him on my father
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded
And there I left him tranced
But who was this
Kent sir the banishd Kent who in disguise
Followd his enemy king and did him service
Improper for a slave
Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife
Help help O help
What kind of help
Speak man
What means that bloody knife
Tis hot it smokes
It came even from the heart ofO shes dead
Who dead speak man
Your lady sir your lady and her sister
By her is poisoned she hath confessd it
Now marry in an instant
Here comes Kent
Produce their bodies be they alive or dead
This judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble
Touches us not with pity
Exit Gentleman
Enter KENT
O is this he
The time will not allow the compliment
Which very manners urges
I am come
To bid my king and master aye good night
Is he not here
Great thing of us forgot
Speak Edmund wheres the king and wheres Cordelia
Seest thou this object Kent
The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in
Alack why thus
Yet Edmund was beloved
The one the other poisond for my sake
And after slew herself
Even so Cover their faces
I pant for life some good I mean to do
Despite of mine own nature Quickly send
Be brief in it to the castle for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia
Nay send in time
Run run O run
To who my lord Who hath the office send
Thy token of reprieve
Well thought on take my sword
Give it the captain
Haste thee for thy life
Exit EDGAR
He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison and
To lay the blame upon her own despair
That she fordid herself
The gods defend her Bear him hence awhile
EDMUND is borne off
Reenter KING LEAR with CORDELIA dead in his arms EDGAR Captain and others following
Howl howl howl howl O you are men of stones
Had I your tongues and eyes Ild use them so
That heavens vault should crack Shes gone for ever
I know when one is dead and when one lives
Shes dead as earth Lend me a lookingglass
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone
Why then she lives
Is this the promised end
Or image of that horror
Fall and cease
This feather stirs she lives if it be so
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt
Kneeling  O my good master
Prithee away
Tis noble Kent your friend
A plague upon you murderers traitors all
I might have saved her now shes gone for ever
Cordelia Cordelia stay a little Ha
What ist thou sayst Her voice was ever soft
Gentle and low an excellent thing in woman
I killd the slave that was ahanging thee
Tis true my lords he did
Did I not fellow
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip I am old now
And these same crosses spoil me Who are you
Mine eyes are not o the best Ill tell you straight
If fortune brag of two she loved and hated
One of them we behold
This is a dull sight Are you not Kent
The same
Your servant Kent Where is your servant Caius
Hes a good fellow I can tell you that
Hell strike and quickly too hes dead and rotten
No my good lord I am the very man
Ill see that straight

That we present us to him

What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied for us we will resign
During the life of this old majesty
To him our absolute power

With boot and such addition as your honours
Have more than merited All friends shall taste
The wages of their virtue and all foes
The cup of their deservings O see see
And my poor fool is hangd No no no life
Why should a dog a horse a rat have life
And thou no breath at all Thoult come no more
Never never never never never
Pray you undo this button thank you sir
Do you see this Look on her look her lips
Look there look there
Dies
He faints My lord my lord
Break heart I prithee break
Look up my lord
Vex not his ghost O let him pass he hates him much
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer
He is gone indeed
The wonder is he hath endured so long
He but usurpd his life
Bear them from hence Our present business
Is general woe
To KENT and EDGAR
Friends of my soul you twain
Rule in this realm and the gored state sustain
I have a journey sir shortly to go
My master calls me I must not say no
The weight of this sad time we must obey
Speak what we feel not what we ought to say
The oldest hath borne most we that are young
Shall never see so much nor live so long
Exeunt with a dead march
Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre BIRON LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN
Let fame that all hunt after in their lives
Live registerd upon our brazen tombs
And then grace us in the disgrace of death
When spite of cormorant devouring Time
The endeavor of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythes keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity
Therefore brave conquerorsfor so you are
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the worlds desires
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world
Our court shall be a little Academe
Still and contemplative in living art
You three Biron Dumain and Longaville
Have sworn for three years term to live with me
My fellowscholars and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here
Your oaths are passd and now subscribe your names
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein
If you are armd to do as sworn to do
Subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too
I am resolved tis but a three years fast
The mind shall banquet though the body pine
Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits
My loving lord Dumain is mortified
The grosser manner of these worlds delights
He throws upon the gross worlds baser slaves
To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die
With all these living in philosophy
I can but say their protestation over
So much dear liege I have already sworn
That is to live and study here three years
But there are other strict observances
As not to see a woman in that term
Which I hope well is not enrolled there
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside
The which I hope is not enrolled there
And then to sleep but three hours in the night
And not be seen to wink of all the day
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day
Which I hope well is not enrolled there
O these are barren tasks too hard to keep
Not to see ladies study fast not sleep
Your oath is passd to pass away from these
Let me say no my liege an if you please
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years space
You swore to that Biron and to the rest
By yea and nay sir then I swore in jest
What is the end of study let me know
Why that to know which else we should not know
Things hid and barrd you mean from common sense
Ay that is studys godlike recompense
Come on then I will swear to study so
To know the thing I am forbid to know
As thusto study where I well may dine
When I to feast expressly am forbid
Or study where to meet some mistress fine
When mistresses from common sense are hid
Or having sworn too hard a keeping oath
Study to break it and not break my troth
If studys gain be thus and this be so
Study knows that which yet it doth not know
Swear me to this and I will neer say no
These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight
Why all delights are vain but that most vain
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain
As painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile
So ere you find where light in darkness lies
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye
Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by
Study is like the heavens glorious sun
That will not be deepsearchd with saucy looks
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others books
These earthly godfathers of heavens lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are
Too much to know is to know nought but fame
And every godfather can give a name
How well hes read to reason against reading
Proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
The spring is near when green geese are abreeding
How follows that
Fit in his place and time
In reason nothing
Something then in rhyme
Biron is like an envious sneaping frost
That bites the firstborn infants of the spring
Well say I am why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing
Why should I joy in any abortive birth
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in Mays newfangled mirth
But like of each thing that in season grows
So you to study now it is too late
Climb oer the house to unlock the little gate
Well sit you out go home Biron adieu
No my good lord I have sworn to stay with you
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say
Yet confident Ill keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years day
Give me the paper let me read the same
And to the strictst decrees Ill write my name
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame
Reads  Item That no woman shall come within a
mile of my court Hath this been proclaimed
Four days ago
Lets see the penalty
Reads
On pain of losing her tongue Who devised this penalty
Marry that did I
Sweet lord and why
To fright them hence with that dread penalty
A dangerous law against gentility
Reads
Item If any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise
This article my liege yourself must break
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French kings daughter with yourself to speak
A maid of grace and complete majesty
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit sick and bedrid father
Therefore this article is made in vain
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither
What say you lords Why this was quite forgot
So study evermore is overshot
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most
Tis won as towns with fire so won so lost
We must of force dispense with this decree
She must lie here on mere necessity
Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years space
For every man with his affects is born
Not by might masterd but by special grace
If I break faith this word shall speak for me
I am forsworn on mere necessity
So to the laws at large I write my name
Subscribes
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame
Suggestions are to other as to me
But I believe although I seem so loath
I am the last that will last keep his oath
But is there no quick recreation granted
Ay that there is Our court you know is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain
A man in all the worlds new fashion planted
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony
A man of complements whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny
This child of fancy that Armado hight
For interim to our studies shall relate
In highborn words the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the worlds debate
How you delight my lords I know not I
But I protest I love to hear him lie
And I will use him for my minstrelsy
Armado is a most illustrious wight
A man of firenew words fashions own knight
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport
And so to study three years is but short
Enter DULL with a letter and COSTARD
Which is the dukes own person
This fellow what wouldst
I myself reprehend his own person for I am his
graces tharborough but I would see his own person
in flesh and blood
This is he
Signior ArmeArmecommends you Theres villany
abroad this letter will tell you more
Sir the contempts thereof are as touching me
A letter from the magnificent Armado
How low soever the matter I hope in God for high words
A high hope for a low heaven God grant us patience
To hear or forbear laughing
To hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to
forbear both
Well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness
The matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta
The manner of it is I was taken with the manner
In what manner
In manner and form following sir all those three
I was seen with her in the manorhouse sitting with
her upon the form and taken following her into the
park which put together is in manner and form
following Now sir for the mannerit is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form
in some form
For the following sir
As it shall follow in my correction and God defend
the right
Will you hear this letter with attention
As we would hear an oracle
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh
Reads  Great deputy the welkins vicegerent and
sole dominator of Navarre my souls earths god
and bodys fostering patron
Not a word of Costard yet
Reads  So it is
It may be so but if he say it is so he is in
telling true but so
Peace
Be to me and every man that dares not fight
No words
Of other mens secrets I beseech you
Reads  So it is besieged with sablecoloured
melancholy I did commend the blackoppressing humour
to the most wholesome physic of thy healthgiving
air and as I am a gentleman betook myself to
walk The time when About the sixth hour when
beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down
to that nourishment which is called supper so much

I mean I walked upon it is ycleped thy park Then

from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which
here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest
but to the place where it standeth northnortheast
and by east from the west corner of thy curious
knotted garden there did I see that lowspirited
swain that base minnow of thy mirth
Me
Reads  that unlettered smallknowing soul
Me
Reads  that shallow vassal
Still me
Reads  which as I remember hight Costard
O me
Reads  sorted and consorted contrary to thy
established proclaimed edict and continent canon
which withO withbut with this I passion to say
wherewith
With a wench
Reads  with a child of our grandmother Eve a
female or for thy more sweet understanding a

estimation
Me ant shall please you I am Anthony Dull

called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
swainI keep her as a vessel of the laws fury
and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring
her to trial Thine in all compliments of devoted

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
This is not so well as I looked for but the best
that ever I heard
Ay the best for the worst But sirrah what say
you to this
Sir I confess the wench
Did you hear the proclamation
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it
It was proclaimed a years imprisonment to be taken
with a wench
I was taken with none sir I was taken with a damsel
Well it was proclaimed damsel
This was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin
It is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin
If it were I deny her virginity I was taken with a maid
This maid will not serve your turn sir
This maid will serve my turn sir
Sir I will pronounce your sentence you shall fast
a week with bran and water
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge
And Don Armado shall be your keeper
My Lord Biron see him deliverd oer
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn
Exeunt FERDINAND LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN
Ill lay my head to any good mans hat
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn
Sirrah come on
I suffer for the truth sir for true it is I was
taken with Jaquenetta and Jaquenetta is a true
girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity Affliction may one day smile again and
till then sit thee down sorrow
Exeunt

DON
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy my

By a familiar demonstration of the working my tough senior
DON
Why tough senior why tough senior
Why tender juvenal why tender juvenal

I spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days which we may
nominate tender
And I tough senior as an appertinent title to your
old time which we may name tough
DON ADRIANO DE
Pretty and apt
How mean you sir I pretty and my saying apt or
I apt and my saying pretty
DON
Thou pretty because little
Little pretty because little Wherefore apt
DON
And therefore apt because quick
Speak you this in my praise master
DON
In thy condign praise
I will praise an eel with the same praise
DON
What that an eel is ingenious
That an eel is quick
DON
I do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood
I am answered sir
DON
I love not to be crossed
Aside  He speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him
DON
I have promised to study three years with the duke
You may do it in an hour sir
DON
Impossible
How many is one thrice told
DON
I am ill at reckoning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster
You are a gentleman and a gamester sir
DON
I confess both they are both the varnish of a
complete man
Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of
deuceace amounts to
DON
It doth amount to one more than two
Which the base vulgar do call three
DON
True
Why sir is this such a piece of study Now here
is three studied ere yell thrice wink and how
easy it is to put years to the word three and
study three years in two words the dancing horse
will tell you
DON
A most fine figure
To prove you a cipher
DON
I will hereupon confess I am in love and as it is
base for a soldier to love so am I in love with a
base wench If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it I would take Desire prisoner and
ransom him to any French courtier for a newdevised
courtesy I think scorn to sigh methinks I should
outswear Cupid Comfort me boy what great men
have been in love
Hercules master
DON
Most sweet Hercules More authority dear boy name

repute and carriage
Samson master he was a man of good carriage great
carriage for he carried the towngates on his back

Of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four
DON
Tell me precisely of what complexion
Of the seawater green sir
DON
Is that one of the four complexions
As I have read sir and the best of them too
DON
Green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a
love of that colour methinks Samson had small reason
for it He surely affected her for her wit
It was so sir for she had a green wit
DON
My love is most immaculate white and red
Most maculate thoughts master are masked under
such colours
DON
Define define welleducated infant
My fathers wit and my mothers tongue assist me
DON
Sweet invocation of a child most pretty and
pathetical
If she be made of white and red
Her faults will neer be known
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown
Then if she fear or be to blame
By this you shall not know
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe
A dangerous rhyme master against the reason of
white and red
DON
Is there not a ballad boy of the King and the Beggar
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
three ages since but I think now tis not to be
found or if it were it would neither serve for
the writing nor the tune
DON
I will have that subject newly writ oer that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent
Boy I do love that country girl that I took in the
park with the rational hind Costard she deserves well

attempted Love is a familiar Love is a devil
there is no evil angel but Love Yet was Samson so
tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was
Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit
Cupids buttshaft is too hard for Hercules club

LOVES LABOURS LOST
Enter the PRINCESS of France ROSALINE MARIA KATHARINE BOYET Lords and other Attendants
Now madam summon up your dearest spirits
Consider who the king your father sends
To whom he sends and whats his embassy
Yourself held precious in the worlds esteem
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe
Matchless Navarre the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine a dowry for a queen
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you
Good Lord Boyet my beauty though but mean
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye
Not utterd by base sale of chapmens tongues
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine
But now to task the tasker good Boyet
You are not ignorant alltelling fame
Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow
Till painful study shall outwear three years
No woman may approach his silent court
Therefore tos seemeth it a needful course
Before we enter his forbidden gates
To know his pleasure and in that behalf
Bold of your worthiness we single you
As our bestmoving fair solicitor
Tell him the daughter of the King of France
On serious business craving quick dispatch
Importunes personal conference with his grace
Haste signify so much while we attend
Like humblevisaged suitors his high will
Proud of employment willingly I go
All pride is willing pride and yours is so
Exit BOYET
Who are the votaries my loving lords
That are vowfellows with this virtuous duke
Lord Longaville is one
Know you the man
I know him madam at a marriagefeast
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge solemnized
In Normandy saw I this Longaville
A man of sovereign parts he is esteemd
Well fitted in arts glorious in arms
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well
The only soil of his fair virtues gloss
If virtues gloss will stain with any soil
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will
Whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power
Some merry mocking lord belike ist so
They say so most that most his humours know
Such shortlived wits do wither as they grow
Who are the rest
The young Dumain a wellaccomplished youth
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved
Most power to do most harm least knowing ill
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good
And shape to win grace though he had no wit
I saw him at the Duke Alencons once
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness
Another of these students at that time
Was there with him if I have heard a truth
Biron they call him but a merrier man
Within the limit of becoming mirth
I never spent an hours talk withal
His eye begets occasion for his wit
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirthmoving jest
Which his fair tongue conceits expositor
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished
So sweet and voluble is his discourse
God bless my ladies are they all in love
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise
Here comes Boyet
Reenter BOYET
Now what admittance lord
Navarre had notice of your fair approach
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all addressd to meet you gentle lady
Before I came Marry thus much I have learnt
He rather means to lodge you in the field
Like one that comes here to besiege his court
Than seek a dispensation for his oath
To let you enter his unpeopled house
Here comes Navarre
Enter FERDINAND LONGAVILLE DUMAIN BIRON and Attendants
Fair princess welcome to the court of Navarre
Fair I give you back again and welcome I have
not yet the roof of this court is too high to be
yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine
You shall be welcome madam to my court
I will be welcome then conduct me thither
Hear me dear lady I have sworn an oath
Our Lady help my lord hell be forsworn
Not for the world fair madam by my will
Why will shall break it will and nothing else
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is
Were my lord so his ignorance were wise
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
I hear your grace hath sworn out housekeeping
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord
And sin to break it
But pardon me I am too suddenbold
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
And suddenly resolve me in my suit
Madam I will if suddenly I may
You will the sooner that I were away
For youll prove perjured if you make me stay
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once
I know you did
How needless was it then to ask the question
You must not be so quick
Tis long of you that spur me with such questions
Your wits too hot it speeds too fast twill tire
Not till it leave the rider in the mire
What time o day
The hour that fools should ask
Now fair befall your mask
Fair fall the face it covers
And send you many lovers
Amen so you be none
Nay then will I be gone
Madam your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars
But say that he or we as neither have
Received that sum yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more in surety of the which
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us
Although not valued to the moneys worth
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied
We will give up our right in Aquitaine
And hold fair friendship with his majesty
But that it seems he little purposeth
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns and not demands
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns
To have his title live in Aquitaine
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is
Dear Princess were not his requests so far
From reasons yielding your fair self should make
A yielding gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again
You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid
I do protest I never heard of it
And if you prove it Ill repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine
We arrest your word
Boyet you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father
Satisfy me so
So please your grace the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound
Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them
It shall suffice me at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness
You may not come fair princess in my gates
But here without you shall be so received
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart
Though so denied fair harbour in my house
Your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
Tomorrow shall we visit you again
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place
Exit
Lady I will commend you to mine own heart
Pray you do my commendations I would be glad to see it
I would you heard it groan
Is the fool sick
Sick at the heart
Alack let it blood
Would that do it good
My physic says ay
Will you prickt with your eye
No point with my knife
Now God save thy life
And yours from long living
I cannot stay thanksgiving
Retiring
Sir I pray you a word what lady is that same
The heir of Alencon Katharine her name
A gallant lady Monsieur fare you well
Exit
I beseech you a word what is she in the white
A woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
Perchance light in the light I desire her name
She hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
Pray you sir whose daughter
Her mothers I have heard
Gods blessing on your beard
Good sir be not offended
She is an heir of Falconbridge
Nay my choler is ended
She is a most sweet lady
Not unlike sir that may be
Exit LONGAVILLE
Whats her name in the cap
Rosaline by good hap
Is she wedded or no
To her will sir or so
You are welcome sir adieu
Farewell to me sir and welcome to you
Exit BIRON
That last is Biron the merry madcap lord
Not a word with him but a jest
And every jest but a word
It was well done of you to take him at his word
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board
Two hot sheeps marry
And wherefore not ships
No sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
You sheep and I pasture shall that finish the jest
So you grant pasture for me
Offering to kiss her
Not so gentle beast
My lips are no common though several they be
Belonging to whom
To my fortunes and me
Good wits will be jangling but gentles agree
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his bookmen for here tis abused
If my observation which very seldom lies
By the hearts still rhetoric disclosed with eyes
Deceive me not now Navarre is infected
With what
With that which we lovers entitle affected
Your reason
Why all his behaviors did make their retire
To the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
His heart like an agate with your print impressd
Proud with his form in his eye pride expressd
His tongue all impatient to speak and not see
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
All senses to that sense did make their repair
To feel only looking on fairest of fair
Methought all his senses were lockd in his eye
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
Who tendering their own worth from where they were glassd
Did point you to buy them along as you passd
His faces own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
Ill give you Aquitaine and all that is his
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss
Come to our pavilion Boyet is disposed
But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed
I only have made a mouth of his eye
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie
Thou art an old lovemonger and speakest skilfully
He is Cupids grandfather and learns news of him
Then was Venus like her mother for her father is but grim
Do you hear my mad wenches
No
What then do you see
Ay our way to be gone
You are too hard for me
Exeunt

With two pitchballs stuck in her face for eyes
Ay and by heaven one that will do the deed

Against the steep uprising of the hill
I know not but I think it was not he
Whoeer a was a showd a mounting mind
Well lords today we shall have our dispatch
On Saturday we will return to France
Then forester my friend where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in
Hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot
I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot
And thereupon thou speakst the fairest shoot
Pardon me madam for I meant not so
What what first praise me and again say no
O shortlived pride Not fair alack for woe
Yes madam fair
Nay never paint me now
Where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
Here good my glass take this for telling true
Fair payment for foul words is more than due
Nothing but fair is that which you inherit
See see my beauty will be saved by merit
O heresy in fair fit for these days
A giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
But come the bow now mercy goes to kill
And shooting well is then accounted ill
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot
Not wounding pity would not let me dot
If wounding then it was to show my skill
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill
And out of question so it is sometimes
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes
When for fames sake for praise an outward part
We bend to that the working of the heart
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
The poor deers blood that my heart means no ill
Do not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty
Only for praise sake when they strive to be
Lords oer their lords
Only for praise and praise we may afford

By heaven that thou art fair is most infallible
true that thou art beauteous truth itself that
thou art lovely More fairer than fair beautiful
than beauteous truer than truth itself have
commiseration on thy heroical vassal The

eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar

overcame three Who came the king why did he
come to see why did he see to overcome to
whom came he to the beggar what saw he the

conclusion is victory on whose side the kings
The captive is enriched on whose side the
beggars The catastrophe is a nuptial on whose
side the kings no on both in one or one in
both I am the king for so stands the comparison
thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness
Shall I command thy love I may shall I enforce
thy love I could shall I entreat thy love I

Wide o the bow hand i faith your hand is out
Indeed a must shoot nearer or hell neer hit the clout

Truly Master Holofernes the epithets are sweetly

Twas not a haud credo twas a pricket
Most barbarous intimation yet a kind of
insinuation as it were in via in way of
explication facere as it were replication or
rather ostentare to show as it were his
inclination after his undressed unpolished

unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to
insert again my haud credo for a deer
I said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket
Twicesod simplicity his coctus
O thou monster Ignorance how deformed dost thou look
Sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
in a book he hath not eat paper as it were he
hath not drunk ink his intellect is not
replenished he is only an animal only sensible in
the duller parts
And such barren plants are set before us that we
thankful should be
Which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he
For as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
So were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school

You two are bookmen can you tell me by your wit
What was a month old at Cains birth thats not five
weeks old as yet

What is Dictynna
A title to Phoebe to Luna to the moon
The moon was a month old when Adam was no more
And raught not to five weeks when he came to
fivescore

Tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange
God comfort thy capacity I say the allusion holds
in the exchange
And I say the pollusion holds in the exchange for
the moon is never but a month old and I say beside

on the death of the deer And to humour the
ignorant call I the deer the princess killed a pricket
Perge good Master Holofernes perge so it shall
please you to abrogate scurrility
I will something affect the letter for it argues facility

sore with shooting

As thy eyebeams when their fresh rays have smote
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
Through the transparent bosom of the deep
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe
Do but behold the tears that swell in me
And they thy glory through my grief will show
But do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
My tears for glasses and still make me weep
O queen of queens how far dost thou excel

Thou makest the triumviry the cornercap of society

Thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me
Vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
Then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
Exhalest this vapourvow in thee it is
If broken then it is no fault of mine
If by me broke what fool is not so wise

Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted

As upright as the cedar
Stoop I say
Her shoulder is with child
As fair as day
Ay as some days but then no sun must shine
O that I had my wish
And I had mine
And I mine too good Lord
Amen so I had mine is not that a good word

Reigns in my blood and will rememberd be
A fever in your blood why then incision
Would let her out in saucers sweet misprision

Once more Ill mark how love can vary wit

On a dayalack the day
Love whose month is ever May
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air
Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen can passage find
That the lover sick to death
Wish himself the heavens breath
Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
Air would I might triumph so
But alack my hand is sworn
Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
Vow alack for youth unmeet
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet
Do not call it sin in me
That I am forsworn for thee
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were
And deny himself for Jove
Turning mortal for thy love
This will I send and something else more plain
That shall express my true loves fasting pain
O would the king Biron and Longaville
Were lovers too Ill to example ill
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note
For none offend where all alike do dote
Advancing  Dumain thy love is far from charity
You may look pale but I should blush I know
To be oerheard and taken napping so
Advancing  Come sir you blush as his your case is such
You chide at him offending twice as much
You do not love Maria Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom to keep down his heart
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
And markd you both and for you both did blush
I heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion
Saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
Ay me says one O Jove the other cries
One her hairs were gold crystal the others eyes
To LONGAVILLE
You would for paradise break faith and troth
To DUMAIN
And Jove for your love would infringe an oath
What will Biron say when that he shall hear
Faith so infringed which such zeal did swear
How will he scorn how will he spend his wit
How will he triumph leap and laugh at it
For all the wealth that ever I did see
I would not have him know so much by me
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy
Advancing
Ah good my liege I pray thee pardon me
Good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
These worms for loving that art most in love
Your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears
Youll not be perjured tis a hateful thing
Tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
But are you not ashamed nay are you not
All three of you to be thus much oershot
You found his mote the king your mote did see
But I a beam do find in each of three
Of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
O me with what strict patience have I sat
To see a king transformed to a gnat
To see great Hercules whipping a gig
And profound Solomon to tune a jig
And Nestor play at pushpin with the boys
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys
Where lies thy grief O tell me good Dumain
And gentle Longaville where lies thy pain
And where my lieges all about the breast
A caudle ho
Too bitter is thy jest
Are we betrayd thus to thy overview
Not you to me but I betrayd by you
I that am honest I that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in
I am betrayd by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
Or groan for love or spend a minutes time
In pruning me When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
A gait a state a brow a breast a waist
A leg a limb
Soft whither away so fast
A true man or a thief that gallops so
I post from love good lover let me go

What did these rent lines show some love of thine
Did they quoth you Who sees the heavenly Rosaline
That like a rude and savage man of Inde
At the first opening of the gorgeous east
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast
What peremptory eaglesighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow
That is not blinded by her majesty
What zeal what fury hath inspired thee now
My love her mistress is a gracious moon
She an attending star scarce seen a light
My eyes are then no eyes nor I Biron
O but for my love day would turn to night
Of all complexions the culld sovereignty
Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
Where several worthies make one dignity
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
Fie painted rhetoric O she needs it not
To things of sale a sellers praise belongs
She passes praise then praise too short doth blot
A witherd hermit fivescore winters worn
Might shake off fifty looking in her eye
Beauty doth varnish age as if newborn
And gives the crutch the cradles infancy
O tis the sun that maketh all things shine
By heaven thy love is black as ebony
Is ebony like her O wood divine
A wife of such wood were felicity
O who can give an oath where is a book
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack
If that she learn not of her eye to look
No face is fair that is not full so black
O paradox Black is the badge of hell
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night
And beautys crest becomes the heavens well
Devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
O if in black my ladys brows be deckd
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect
And therefore is she born to make black fair
Her favour turns the fashion of the days
For native blood is counted painting now
And therefore red that would avoid dispraise
Paints itself black to imitate her brow
To look like her are chimneysweepers black
And since her time are colliers counted bright
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack
Dark needs no candles now for dark is light
Your mistresses dare never come in rain
For fear their colours should be washd away
Twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
Ill find a fairer face not washd today
Ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here
No devil will fright thee then so much as she
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
Look heres thy love my foot and her face see
O if the streets were paved with thine eyes
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread
O vile then as she goes what upward lies
The street should see as she walkd overhead
But what of this are we not all in love
Nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
Then leave this chat and good Biron now prove
Our loving lawful and our faith not torn
Ay marry there some flattery for this evil
O some authority how to proceed
Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
Some salve for perjury
Tis more than need
Have at you then affections men at arms
Consider what you first did swear unto
To fast to study and to see no woman
Flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth
Say can you fast your stomachs are too young
And abstinence engenders maladies
And where that you have vowd to study lords
In that each of you have forsworn his book
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look
For when would you my lord or you or you
Have found the ground of studys excellence
Without the beauty of a womans face
From womens eyes this doctrine I derive  They are the ground the books the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
Why universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries
The sinewy vigour of the traveller
Now for not looking on a womans face
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too the causer of your vow
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a womans eye
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is
Then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes
Do we not likewise see our learning there
O we have made a vow to study lords
And in that vow we have forsworn our books
For when would you my liege or you or you
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beautys tutors have enrichd you with
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
But love first learned in a ladys eyes
Lives not alone immured in the brain
But with the motion of all elements
Courses as swift as thought in every power
And gives to every power a double power
Above their functions and their offices
It adds a precious seeing to the eye
A lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind
A lovers ear will hear the lowest sound
When the suspicious head of theft is stoppd
Loves feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockld snails
Loves tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste
For valour is not Love a Hercules
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides
Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical
As bright Apollos lute strung with his hair
And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temperd with Loves sighs
O then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility
From womens eyes this doctrine I derive
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire
They are the books the arts the academes
That show contain and nourish all the world
Else none at all in ought proves excellent
Then fools you were these women to forswear
Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
For wisdoms sake a word that all men love
Or for loves sake a word that loves all men
Or for mens sake the authors of these women
Or womens sake by whom we men are men
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
It is religion to be thus forsworn
For charity itself fulfills the law
And who can sever love from charity
Saint Cupid then and soldiers to the field
Advance your standards and upon them lords
Pellmell down with them but be first advised
In conflict that you get the sun of them
Now to plaindealing lay these glozes by
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France
And win them too therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents
First from the park let us conduct them thither
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them
Such as the shortness of the time can shape
For revels dances masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowers
Away away no time shall be omitted
That will betime and may by us be fitted
Allons allons Sowd cockle reapd no corn
And justice always whirls in equal measure
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
If so our copper buys no better treasure

LOVES LABOURS LOST
Enter the PRINCESS KATHARINE ROSALINE and MARIA
Sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
If fairings come thus plentifully in
A lady walld about with diamonds
Look you what I have from the loving king
Madame came nothing else along with that
Nothing but this yes as much love in rhyme
As would be crammd up in a sheet of paper
Writ o both sides the leaf margent and all
That he was fain to seal on Cupids name
That was the way to make his godhead wax
For he hath been five thousand years a boy
Ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
Youll neer be friends with him a killd your sister
He made her melancholy sad and heavy
And so she died had she been light like you
Of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
She might ha been a grandam ere she died
And so may you for a light heart lives long
Whats your dark meaning mouse of this light word
A light condition in a beauty dark
We need more light to find your meaning out
Youll mar the light by taking it in snuff
Therefore Ill darkly end the argument
Look what you do you do it still i the dark
So do not you for you are a light wench
Indeed I weigh not you and therefore light
You weigh me not O thats you care not for me
Great reason for past cure is still past care
Well bandied both a set of wit well playd
But Rosaline you have a favour too
Who sent it and what is it
I would you knew
An if my face were but as fair as yours
My favour were as great be witness this
Nay I have verses too I thank Biron
The numbers true and were the numbering too
I were the fairest goddess on the ground
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs
O he hath drawn my picture in his letter
Any thing like
Much in the letters nothing in the praise
Beauteous as ink a good conclusion
Fair as a text B in a copybook
Ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor
My red dominical my golden letter
O that your face were not so full of Os
A pox of that jest and I beshrew all shrows
But Katharine what was sent to you from fair Dumain
Madam this glove
Did he not send you twain
Yes madam and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover
A huge translation of hypocrisy
Vilely compiled profound simplicity
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville
The letter is too long by half a mile
I think no less Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short
Ay or I would these hands might never part
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so
That same Biron Ill torture ere I go
O that I knew he were but in by the week
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests
So perttauntlike would I oersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate
None are so surely caught when they are catchd
As wit turnd fool folly in wisdom hatchd
Hath wisdoms warrant and the help of school
And wits own grace to grace a learned fool
The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravitys revolt to wantonness
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise when wit doth dote
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove by wit worth in simplicity
Here comes Boyet and mirth is in his face
Enter BOYET
O I am stabbd with laughter Wheres her grace
Thy news Boyet
Prepare madam prepare
Arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
Against your peace Love doth approach disguised
Armed in arguments youll be surprised
Muster your wits stand in your own defence
Or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid What are they
That charge their breath against us say scout say
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
When lo to interrupt my purposed rest
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by
And overheard what you shall overhear
That by and by disguised they will be here
Their herald is a pretty knavish page
That well by heart hath connd his embassage
Thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out
For quoth the king an angel shalt thou see
Yet fear not thou but speak audaciously
The boy replied An angel is not evil
I should have feard her had she been a devil
With that all laughd and clappd him on the shoulder
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder
One rubbd his elbow thus and fleerd and swore
A better speech was never spoke before
Another with his finger and his thumb
Cried Via we will dot come what will come
The third he caperd and cried All goes well
The fourth turnd on the toe and down he fell
With that they all did tumble on the ground
With such a zealous laughter so profound
That in this spleen ridiculous appears
To cheque their folly passions solemn tears
But what but what come they to visit us
They do they do and are apparelld thus
Like Muscovites or Russians as I guess
Their purpose is to parle to court and dance
And every one his lovefeat will advance
Unto his several mistress which theyll know
By favours several which they did bestow
And will they so the gallants shall be taskd
For ladies we shall every one be maskd
And not a man of them shall have the grace
Despite of suit to see a ladys face
Hold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
And then the king will court thee for his dear
Hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline
And change your favours too so shall your loves
Woo contrary deceived by these removes
Come on then wear the favours most in sight
But in this changing what is your intent
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs
They do it but in mocking merriment
And mock for mock is only my intent
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook and so be mockd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet
With visages displayed to talk and greet
But shall we dance if they desire tot
No to the death we will not move a foot
Nor to their pennd speech render we no grace
But while tis spoke each turn away her face
Why that contempt will kill the speakers heart
And quite divorce his memory from his part
Therefore I do it and I make no doubt
The rest will neer come in if he be out
Theres no such sport as sport by sport oerthrown
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own
So shall we stay mocking intended game
And they well mockd depart away with shame
Trumpets sound within
The trumpet sounds be maskd the maskers come
The Ladies mask
Enter Blackamoors with music MOTH FERDINAND  BIRON LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN in Russian habits and masked
All hail the richest beauties on the earth
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta
A holy parcel of the fairest dames
The Ladies turn their backs to him
That ever turnd theirbacksto mortal views
Aside to MOTH  Their eyes villain their eyes
That ever turnd their eyes to mortal viewsOut
True out indeed
Out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
Not to behold
Aside to MOTH  Once to behold rogue
Once to behold with your sunbeamed eyes
with your sunbeamed eyes
They will not answer to that epithet
You were best call it daughterbeamed eyes
They do not mark me and that brings me out
Is this your perfectness be gone you rogue
Exit MOTH
What would these strangers know their minds Boyet
If they do speak our language tis our will
That some plain man recount their purposes
Know what they would
What would you with the princess
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation
What would they say they
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation
Why that they have and bid them so be gone
She says you have it and you may be gone
Say to her we have measured many miles
To tread a measure with her on this grass
They say that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass
It is not so Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile if they have measured many
The measure then of one is easily told
If to come hither you have measured miles
And many miles the princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile
Tell her we measure them by weary steps
She hears herself
How many weary steps
Of many weary miles you have oergone
Are numberd in the travel of one mile
We number nothing that we spend for you
Our duty is so rich so infinite
That we may do it still without accompt
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
That we like savages may worship it
My face is but a moon and clouded too
Blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
Vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
Those clouds removed upon our watery eyne
O vain petitioner beg a greater matter
Thou now requestst but moonshine in the water
Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
Thou bidst me beg this begging is not strange
Play music then Nay you must do it soon
Music plays
Not yet no dance Thus change I like the moon
Will you not dance How come you thus estranged
You took the moon at full but now shes changed
Yet still she is the moon and I the man
The music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
Our ears vouchsafe it
But your legs should do it
Since you are strangers and come here by chance
Well not be nice take hands We will not dance
Why take we hands then
Only to part friends
Curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends
More measure of this measure be not nice
We can afford no more at such a price
Prize you yourselves what buys your company
Your absence only
That can never be
Then cannot we be bought and so adieu
Twice to your visor and half once to you
If you deny to dance lets hold more chat
In private then
I am best pleased with that
They converse apart
Whitehanded mistress one sweet word with thee
Honey and milk and sugar there is three
Nay then two treys and if you grow so nice
Metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice
Theres halfadozen sweets
Seventh sweet adieu
Since you can cog Ill play no more with you
One word in secret
Let it not be sweet
Thou grievest my gall
Gall bitter
Therefore meet
They converse apart
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word
Name it
Fair lady
Say you so Fair lord
Take that for your fair lady
Please it you
As much in private and Ill bid adieu
They converse apart
What was your vizard made without a tongue
I know the reason lady why you ask
O for your reason quickly sir I long
You have a double tongue within your mask
And would afford my speechless vizard half
Veal quoth the Dutchman Is not veal a calf
A calf fair lady
No a fair lord calf
Lets part the word
No Ill not be your half
Take all and wean it it may prove an ox
Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
Will you give horns chaste lady do not so
Then die a calf before your horns do grow
One word in private with you ere I die
Bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
They converse apart
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razors edge invisible
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen
Above the sense of sense so sensible
Seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things
Not one word more my maids break off break off
By heaven all drybeaten with pure scoff
Farewell mad wenches you have simple wits
Twenty adieus my frozen Muscovits
Exeunt FERDINAND Lords and Blackamoors
Are these the breed of wits so wonderd at
Tapers they are with your sweet breaths puffd out
Wellliking wits they have gross gross fat fat
O poverty in wit kinglypoor flout
Will they not think you hang themselves tonight
Or ever but in vizards show their faces
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite
O they were all in lamentable cases
The king was weepingripe for a good word
Biron did swear himself out of all suit
Dumain was at my service and his sword
No point quoth I my servant straight was mute
Lord Longaville said I came oer his heart
And trow you what he called me
Qualm perhaps
Yes in good faith
Go sickness as thou art
Well better wits have worn plain statutecaps
But will you hear the king is my love sworn
And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me
And Longaville was for my service born
Dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree
Madam and pretty mistresses give ear
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity
Will they return
They will they will God knows
And leap for joy though they are lame with blows
Therefore change favours and when they repair
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air
How blow how blow speak to be understood
Fair ladies maskd are roses in their bud
Dismaskd their damask sweet commixture shown
Are angels vailing clouds or roses blown
Avaunt perplexity What shall we do
If they return in their own shapes to woo
Good madam if by me youll be advised
Lets mock them still as well known as disguised
Let us complain to them what fools were here
Disguised like Muscovites in shapeless gear
And wonder what they were and to what end
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely pennd
And their rough carriage so ridiculous
Should be presented at our tent to us
Ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand
Whip to our tents as roes run oer land
Exeunt PRINCESS ROSALINE KATHARINE and MARIA
Reenter FERDINAND BIRON LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN in their proper habits
Fair sir God save you Wheres the princess
Gone to her tent Please it your majesty
Command me any service to her thither
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word
I will and so will she I know my lord
Exit
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
And utters it again when God doth please
He is wits pedler and retails his wares
At wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
And we that sell by gross the Lord doth know
Have not the grace to grace it with such show
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve
Had he been Adam he had tempted Eve
A can carve too and lisp why this is he
That kissd his hand away in courtesy
This is the ape of form monsieur the nice
That when he plays at tables chides the dice
In honourable terms nay he can sing
A mean most meanly and in ushering
Mend him who can the ladies call him sweet
The stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
This is the flower that smiles on every one
To show his teeth as white as whales bone
And consciences that will not die in debt
Pay him the due of honeytongued Boyet
A blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
That put Armados page out of his part
See where it comes Behavior what wert thou
Till this madman showd thee and what art thou now
Reenter the PRINCESS ushered by BOYET ROSALINE MARIA and KATHARINE
All hail sweet madam and fair time of day
Fair in all hail is foul as I conceive
Construe my speeches better if you may
Then wish me better I will give you leave
We came to visit you and purpose now
To lead you to our court vouchsafe it then
This field shall hold me and so hold your vow
Nor God nor I delights in perjured men
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke
The virtue of your eye must break my oath
You nickname virtue vice you should have spoke
For virtues office never breaks mens troth
Now by my maiden honour yet as pure
As the unsullied lily I protest
A world of torments though I should endure
I would not yield to be your houses guest
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths vowd with integrity
O you have lived in desolation here
Unseen unvisited much to our shame
Not so my lord it is not so I swear
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game
A mess of Russians left us but of late
How madam Russians
Ay in truth my lord
Trim gallants full of courtship and of state
Madam speak true It is not so my lord
My lady to the manner of the days
In courtesy gives undeserving praise
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit here they stayd an hour
And talkd apace and in that hour my lord
They did not bless us with one happy word
I dare not call them fools but this I think
When they are thirsty fools would fain have drink
This jest is dry to me Fair gentle sweet
Your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
With eyes best seeing heavens fiery eye
By light we lose light your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor
This proves you wise and rich for in my eye
I am a fool and full of poverty
But that you take what doth to you belong
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue
O I am yours and all that I possess
All the fool mine
I cannot give you less
Which of the vizards was it that you wore
Where when what vizard why demand you this
There then that vizard that superfluous case
That hid the worse and showd the better face
We are descried theyll mock us now downright
Let us confess and turn it to a jest
Amazed my lord why looks your highness sad
Help hold his brows hell swoon Why look you pale
Seasick I think coming from Muscovy
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
Can any face of brass hold longer out
lady dart thy skill at me
Bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
And I will wish thee never more to dance
Nor never more in Russian habit wait
O never will I trust to speeches pennd
Nor to the motion of a schoolboys tongue
Nor never come in vizard to my friend
Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harpers song
Taffeta phrases silken terms precise
Threepiled hyperboles spruce affectation
Figures pedantical these summerflies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation
I do forswear them and I here protest
By this white glovehow white the hand God knows
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes
And to begin wenchso God help me la
My love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw
Sans sans I pray you
Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage bear with me I am sick
Ill leave it by degrees Soft let us see
Write Lord have mercy on us on those three
They are infected in their hearts it lies
They have the plague and caught it of your eyes
These lords are visited you are not free
For the Lords tokens on you do I see
No they are free that gave these tokens to us
Our states are forfeit seek not to undo us
It is not so for how can this be true
That you stand forfeit being those that sue
Peace for I will not have to do with you
Nor shall not if I do as I intend
Speak for yourselves my wit is at an end
Teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse
The fairest is confession
Were not you here but even now disguised
Madam I was
And were you well advised
I was fair madam
When you then were here
What did you whisper in your ladys ear
That more than all the world I did respect her
When she shall challenge this you will reject her
Upon mine honour no
Peace peace forbear
Your oath once broke you force not to forswear
Despise me when I break this oath of mine
I will and therefore keep it Rosaline
What did the Russian whisper in your ear
Madam he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight and did value me
Above this world adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me or else die my lover
God give thee joy of him the noble lord
Most honourably doth unhold his word
What mean you madam by my life my troth
I never swore this lady such an oath
By heaven you did and to confirm it plain
You gave me this but take it sir again
My faith and this the princess I did give
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
Pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
And Lord Biron I thank him is my dear
What will you have me or your pearl again
Neither of either I remit both twain
I see the trick ont here was a consent
Knowing aforehand of our merriment
To dash it like a Christmas comedy
Some carrytale some pleaseman some slight zany
Some mumblenews some trencherknight some Dick
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when shes disposed
Told our intents before which once disclosed
The ladies did change favours and then we
Following the signs wood but the sign of she
Now to our perjury to add more terror
We are again forsworn in will and error
Much upon this it is and might not you
To BOYET
Forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
Do not you know my ladys foot by the squier
And laugh upon the apple of her eye
And stand between her back sir and the fire
Holding a trencher jesting merrily
You put our page out go you are allowd
Die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
You leer upon me do you theres an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword
Full merrily
Hath this brave manage this career been run
Lo he is tilting straight Peace I have done

We are shameproof my lord and tis some policy
To have one show worse than the kings and his company
I say they shall not come
Nay my good lord let me oerrule you now
That sport best pleases that doth least know how
Where zeal strives to content and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth
When great things labouring perish in their birth
A right description of our sport my lord

seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
discretion and I will right myself like a soldier
Exeunt Worthies
How fares your majesty
Boyet prepare I will away tonight
Madam not so I do beseech you stay
Prepare I say I thank you gracious lords
For all your fair endeavors and entreat
Out of a newsad soul that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits
If overboldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath your gentleness
Was guilty of it Farewell worthy lord
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
Excuse me so coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtaind
The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince
Yet since loves argument was first on foot
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
From what it purposed since to wail friends lost
Is not by much so wholesomeprofitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found
I understand you not my griefs are double
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
And by these badges understand the king
For your fair sakes have we neglected time
Playd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies
Hath much deformd us fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents
And what in us hath seemd ridiculous
As love is full of unbefitting strains
All wanton as a child skipping and vain
Formd by the eye and therefore like the eye
Full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance
Which particoated presence of loose love
Put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities
Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
Suggested us to make Therefore ladies
Our love being yours the error that love makes
Is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us bothfair ladies you
And even that falsehood in itself a sin
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace
We have received your letters full of love
Your favours the ambassadors of love
And in our maiden council rated them
At courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
As bombast and as lining to the time
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion like a merriment
Our letters madam showd much more than jest
So did our looks
We did not quote them so
Now at the latest minute of the hour
Grant us your loves
A time methinks too short
To make a worldwithoutend bargain in
No no my lord your grace is perjured much
Full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
If for my love as there is no such cause
You will do aught this shall you do for me
Your oath I will not trust but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage
Remote from all the pleasures of the world
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood
If frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
But that it bear this trial and last love
Then at the expiration of the year
Come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
And by this virgin palm now kissing thine
I will be thine and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my fathers death
If this thou do deny let our hands part
Neither entitled in the others heart
If this or more than this I would deny
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast
But what to me my love but what to me A wife
A beard fair health and honesty
With threefold love I wish you all these three
O shall I say I thank you gentle wife
Not so my lord a twelvemonth and a day
Ill mark no words that smoothfaced wooers say
Come when the king doth to my lady come
Then if I have much love Ill give you some
Ill serve thee true and faithfully till then
Yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again
What says Maria
At the twelvemonths end
Ill change my black gown for a faithful friend
Ill stay with patience but the time is long
The liker you few taller are so young
Studies my lady mistress look on me
Behold the window of my heart mine eye
What humble suit attends thy answer there
Impose some service on me for thy love
Oft have I heard of you my Lord Biron
Before I saw you and the worlds large tongue
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
And therewithal to win me if you please
Without the which I am not to be won
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches and your task shall be
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
To enforce the pained impotent to smile
To move wild laughter in the throat of death
It cannot be it is impossible
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony
Why thats the way to choke a gibing spirit
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
A jests prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it never in the tongue
Of him that makes it then if sickly ears
Deafd with the clamours of their own dear groans
Will hear your idle scorns continue then
And I will have you and that fault withal
But if they will not throw away that spirit
And I shall find you empty of that fault
Right joyful of your reformation
A twelvemonth well befall what will befall
Ill jest a twelvemonth in an hospital
To FERDINAND  Ay sweet my lord and so I take my leave
No madam we will bring you on your way
Our wooing doth not end like an old play
Jack hath not Jill these ladies courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy
Come sir it wants a twelvemonth and a day
And then twill end
Thats too long for a play

SPRING
When daisies pied and violets blue
And ladysmocks all silverwhite
And cuckoobuds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight
The cuckoo then on every tree
Mocks married men for thus sings he Cuckoo
Cuckoo cuckoo O word of fear
Unpleasing to a married ear
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmens clocks
When turtles tread and rooks and daws
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then on every tree
Mocks married men for thus sings he Cuckoo
Cuckoo cuckoo O word of fear
Unpleasing to a married ear
WINTER
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail
When blood is nippd and ways be foul
Then nightly sings the staring owl Tuwhit
Tuwho a merry note
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And coughing drowns the parsons saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
And Marians nose looks red and raw
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl
Then nightly sings the staring owl Tuwhit
Tuwho a merry note
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot

Alarum within Enter DUNCAN MALCOLM DONALBAIN LENNOX with Attendants meeting a bleeding Sergeant
What bloody man is that He can report
As seemeth by his plight of the revolt
The newest state
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
Gainst my captivity Hail brave friend
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it
Doubtful it stood
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art The merciless Macdonwald
Worthy to be a rebel for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon himfrom the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
And fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
Showd like a rebels whore but alls too weak
For brave Macbethwell he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune with his brandishd steel
Which smoked with bloody execution
Like valours minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave
Which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him
Till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps
And fixd his head upon our battlements
O valiant cousin worthy gentleman
As whence the sun gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
So from that spring whence comfort seemd to come
Discomfort swells Mark king of Scotland mark
No sooner justice had with valour armd
Compelld these skipping kerns to trust their heels
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage
With furbishd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault
Dismayd not this
Our captains Macbeth and Banquo
Yes
As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
If I say sooth I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks so they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Or memorise another Golgotha
I cannot tell
But I am faint my gashes cry for help
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds
They smack of honour both Go get him surgeons
Exit Sergeant attended
Who comes here
Enter ROSS
The worthy thane of Ross
What a haste looks through his eyes So should he look
That seems to speak things strange
God save the king
Whence camest thou worthy thane
From Fife great king
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold Norway himself
With terrible numbers
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict
Till that Bellonas bridegroom lappd in proof
Confronted him with selfcomparisons
Point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
The victory fell on us
Great happiness
That now
Sweno the Norways king craves composition
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colmes inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest go pronounce his present death
And with his former title greet Macbeth
Ill see it done
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won
Exeunt

Where hast thou been sister
Killing swine
Sister where thou
A sailors wife had chestnuts in her lap
And munchd and munchd and munchd

Aroint thee witch the rumpfed ronyon cries
Her husbands to Aleppo gone master o the Tiger
But in a sieve Ill thither sail
And like a rat without a tail
Ill do Ill do and Ill do
Ill give thee a wind
Thourt kind
And I another
I myself have all the other
And the very ports they blow
All the quarters that they know

I will drain him dry as hay
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid
He shall live a man forbid
Weary sennights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle peak and pine
Though his bark cannot be lost
Yet it shall be tempesttost
Look what I have
Show me show me
Here I have a pilots thumb
Wreckd as homeward he did come
Drum within
A drum a drum
Macbeth doth come
The weird sisters hand in hand
Posters of the sea and land
Thus do go about about
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again to make up nine
Peace the charms wound up
Enter MACBETH and BANQUO
So foul and fair a day I have not seen
How far ist calld to Forres What are these
So witherd and so wild in their attire
That look not like the inhabitants o the earth
And yet are ont Live you or are you aught
That man may question You seem to understand me
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips you should be women
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so
Speak if you can what are you
All hail Macbeth hail to thee thane of Glamis
All hail Macbeth hail to thee thane of Cawdor
All hail Macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter
Good sir why do you start and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair I the name of truth
Are ye fantastical or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope
That he seems rapt withal to me you speak not
If you can look into the seeds of time
And say which grain will grow and which will not
Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate
Hail
Hail
Hail
Lesser than Macbeth and greater
Not so happy yet much happier
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
Banquo and Macbeth all hail
Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
By Sinels death I know I am thane of Glamis
But how of Cawdor the thane of Cawdor lives
A prosperous gentleman and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief
No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you
Witches vanish
The earth hath bubbles as the water has
And these are of them Whither are they vanishd
Into the air and what seemd corporal melted
As breath into the wind Would they had stayd
Were such things here as we do speak about
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner
Your children shall be kings
You shall be king
And thane of Cawdor too went it not so
To the selfsame tune and words Whos here
Enter ROSS and ANGUS
The king hath happily received Macbeth
The news of thy success and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels fight
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his silenced with that
In viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
Strange images of death As thick as hail
Came post with post and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdoms great defence
And pourd them down before him
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks
Only to herald thee into his sight
Not pay thee
And for an earnest of a greater honour
He bade me from him call thee thane of Cawdor
In which addition hail most worthy thane
For it is thine
What can the devil speak true
The thane of Cawdor lives why do you dress me
In borrowd robes
Who was the thane lives yet
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined
With those of Norway or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage or that with both
He labourd in his countrys wreck I know not
But treasons capital confessd and proved
Have overthrown him
Aside  Glamis and thane of Cawdor
The greatest is behind
To ROSS and ANGUS
Thanks for your pains
To BANQUO
Do you not hope your children shall be kings
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them
That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown
Besides the thane of Cawdor But tis strange
And oftentimes to win us to our harm
The instruments of darkness tell us truths
Win us with honest trifles to betrays
In deepest consequence
Cousins a word I pray you
AsideTwo truths are told
Of the imperial themeI thank you gentlemen
Aside
Cannot be ill cannot be good if ill
Why hath it given me earnest of success
Commencing in a truth I am thane of Cawdor
If good why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Against the use of nature Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings
My thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smotherd in surmise and nothing is
But what is not
Look how our partners rapt
Aside  If chance will have me king why chance may crown me
Without my stir
New horrors come upon him
Like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use
Aside                Come what come may
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day
Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure
Give me your favour my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains
Are registerd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them Let us toward the king
Think upon what hath chanced and at more time
The interim having weighd it let us speak
Our free hearts each to other
Very gladly
Till then enough Come friends
Exeunt
Flourish Enter DUNCAN MALCOLM DONALBAIN LENNOX and Attendants
Is execution done on Cawdor Are not
Those in commission yet returnd
My liege
They are not yet come back But I have spoke
With one that saw him die who did report
That very frankly he confessd his treasons
Implored your highness pardon and set forth
A deep repentance nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
As twere a careless trifle
Theres no art
To find the minds construction in the face
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust
Enter MACBETH BANQUO ROSS and ANGUS
O worthiest cousin
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee Would thou hadst less deserved
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine only I have left to say
More is thy due than more than all can pay
The service and the loyalty I owe
In doing it pays itself Your highness part
Is to receive our duties and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants
Which do but what they should by doing every thing
Safe toward your love and honour
Welcome hither
I have begun to plant thee and will labour
To make thee full of growing Noble Banquo
That hast no less deserved nor must be known
No less to have done so let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart
There if I grow
The harvest is your own
My plenteous joys
Wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes
And you whose places are the nearest know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only
But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
On all deservers From hence to Inverness
And bind us further to you
The rest is labour which is not used for you
Ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach
So humbly take my leave
My worthy Cawdor
Aside  The Prince of Cumberland that is a step
On which I must fall down or else oerleap
For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires
Let not light see my black and deep desires
The eye wink at the hand yet let that be
Which the eye fears when it is done to see
Exit
True worthy Banquo he is full so valiant
And in his commendations I am fed
It is a banquet to me Lets after him
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
It is a peerless kinsman
Flourish Exeunt
Enter LADY MACBETH reading a letter
They met me in the day of success and I have
learned by the perfectest report they have more in
them than mortal knowledge When I burned in desire
to question them further they made themselves air
into which they vanished Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it came missives from the king who
allhailed me Thane of Cawdor by which title
before these weird sisters saluted me and referred
me to the coming on of time with Hail king that
shalt be This have I thought good to deliver
thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it
to thy heart and farewell
Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be
What thou art promised yet do I fear thy nature
It is too full o the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great
Art not without ambition but without
The illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly
That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
And yet wouldst wrongly win thouldst have great Glamis
That which cries Thus thou must do if thou have it
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crownd withal
Enter a Messenger
What is your tidings
The king comes here tonight
Thourt mad to say it
Is not thy master with him who weret so
Would have informd for preparation
So please you it is true our thane is coming
One of my fellows had the speed of him
Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
Than would make up his message
Give him tending
He brings great news
Exit Messenger
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements Come you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
And fill me from the crown to the toe topfull
Of direst cruelty make thick my blood
Stop up the access and passage to remorse
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
The effect and it Come to my womans breasts
And take my milk for gall you murdering ministers
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on natures mischief Come thick night
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
To cry Hold hold
Enter MACBETH
Great Glamis worthy Cawdor
Greater than both by the allhail hereafter
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present and I feel now
The future in the instant
My dearest love
Duncan comes here tonight
And when goes hence
Tomorrow as he purposes
O never
Shall sun that morrow see
Your face my thane is as a book where men
May read strange matters To beguile the time
Look like the time bear welcome in your eye
Your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
But be the serpent undert He thats coming
Must be provided for and you shall put
This nights great business into my dispatch
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom
We will speak further
Only look up clear
To alter favour ever is to fear
Leave all the rest to me
Exeunt
Hautboys and torches Enter DUNCAN MALCOLM  DONALBAIN BANQUO LENNOX MACDUFF ROSS ANGUS and Attendants
This castle hath a pleasant seat the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses
This guest of summer
The templehaunting martlet does approve
By his loved mansionry that the heavens breath
Smells wooingly here no jutty frieze
Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle
Where they most breed and haunt I have observed
The air is delicate
Enter LADY MACBETH
See see our honourd hostess
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble
Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God ild us for your pains
And thank us for your trouble
All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house for those of old
And the late dignities heapd up to them
We rest your hermits
Wheres the thane of Cawdor
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
To be his purveyor but he rides well
And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him
To his home before us Fair and noble hostess
We are your guest tonight
Your servants ever
Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt
To make their audit at your highness pleasure
Still to return your own
Give me your hand
Conduct me to mine host we love him highly
And shall continue our graces towards him
By your leave hostess
Exeunt
Hautboys and torches Enter a Sewer and divers  Servants with dishes and service and pass over the stage Then enter MACBETH
If it were done when tis done then twere well
It were done quickly if the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence and catch
With his surcease success that but this blow
Might be the beall and the endall here
But here upon this bank and shoal of time
Weld jump the life to come But in these cases
We still have judgment here that we but teach
Bloody instructions which being taught return
To plague the inventor this evenhanded justice
Commends the ingredients of our poisond chalice
To our own lips Hes here in double trust
First as I am his kinsman and his subject
Strong both against the deed then as his host
Who should against his murderer shut the door
Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
So clear in his great office that his virtues
Will plead like angels trumpettongued against
The deep damnation of his takingoff
And pity like a naked newborn babe
Striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent but only
Vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself
And falls on the other
Enter LADY MACBETH
How now what news
He has almost suppd why have you left the chamber
Hath he askd for me
Know you not he has
We will proceed no further in this business
He hath honourd me of late and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss
Not cast aside so soon
Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dressd yourself hath it slept since
And wakes it now to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely From this time
Such I account thy love Art thou afeard
As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteemst the ornament of life
And live a coward in thine own esteem
Letting I dare not wait upon I would
Like the poor cat i the adage
Prithee peace
I dare do all that may become a man
Who dares do more is none
What beast wast then
That made you break this enterprise to me
When you durst do it then you were a man
And to be more than what you were you would
Be so much more the man Nor time nor place
Did then adhere and yet you would make both
They have made themselves and that their fitness now
Does unmake you I have given suck and know
How tender tis to love the babe that milks me
I would while it was smiling in my face
Have pluckd my nipple from his boneless gums
And dashd the brains out had I so sworn as you
Have done to this
If we should fail
We fail
But screw your courage to the stickingplace
And well not fail When Duncan is asleep
Whereto the rather shall his days hard journey
Soundly invite himhis two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory the warder of the brain
Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan what not put upon
His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell
Bring forth menchildren only
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males Will it not be received
When we have markd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers
That they have donet
Who dares receive it other
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death
I am settled and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat
Away and mock the time with fairest show
False face must hide what the false heart doth know
Exeunt
Enter BANQUO and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him
How goes the night boy
The moon is down I have not heard the clock
And she goes down at twelve
I taket tis later sir
Hold take my sword Theres husbandry in heaven
Their candles are all out Take thee that too
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me
And yet I would not sleep merciful powers
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose
Enter MACBETH and a Servant with a torch
Give me my sword
Whos there
A friend
What sir not yet at rest The kings abed
He hath been in unusual pleasure and
Sent forth great largess to your offices
This diamond he greets your wife withal
By the name of most kind hostess and shut up
In measureless content
Being unprepared
Our will became the servant to defect
Which else should free have wrought
Alls well
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
To you they have showd some truth
I think not of them
Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
We would spend it in some words upon that business
If you would grant the time
At your kindst leisure
If you shall cleave to my consent when tis
It shall make honour for you
So I lose none
In seeking to augment it but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear
I shall be counselld
Good repose the while
Thanks sir the like to you
Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE
Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed
Exit Servant
Is this a dagger which I see before me
The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee
I have thee not and yet I see thee still
Art thou not fatal vision sensible
To feeling as to sight or art thou but
A dagger of the mind a false creation
Proceeding from the heatoppressed brain
I see thee yet in form as palpable
As this which now I draw
Thou marshallst me the way that I was going
And such an instrument I was to use
Mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses
Or else worth all the rest I see thee still
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
Which was not so before Theres no such thing
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes Now oer the one halfworld
Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
The curtaind sleep witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecates offerings and witherd murder
Alarumd by his sentinel the wolf
Whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace
With Tarquins ravishing strides towards his design
Moves like a ghost Thou sure and firmset earth
Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout
And take the present horror from the time
Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
A bell rings
I go and it is done the bell invites me
Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell
Exit
Enter LADY MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
What hath quenchd them hath given me fire
Hark Peace
It was the owl that shriekd the fatal bellman
Which gives the sternst goodnight He is about it
The doors are open and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores I have druggd
their possets
That death and nature do contend about them
Whether they live or die
Within  Whos there what ho
Alack I am afraid they have awaked
And tis not done The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready
He could not miss em Had he not resembled
My father as he slept I had donet
Enter MACBETH
My husband
I have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Did not you speak
When
Now
As I descended
Ay
Hark
Who lies i the second chamber
Donalbain
This is a sorry sight
Looking on his hands
A foolish thought to say a sorry sight
Theres one did laugh ins sleep and one cried
Murder
That they did wake each other I stood and heard them
But they did say their prayers and addressd them
Again to sleep
There are two lodged together
One cried God bless us and Amen the other
As they had seen me with these hangmans hands
Listening their fear I could not say Amen
When they did say God bless us
Consider it not so deeply
But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen
I had most need of blessing and Amen
Stuck in my throat
These deeds must not be thought
After these ways so it will make us mad
Methought I heard a voice cry Sleep no more
Macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep
Sleep that knits up the ravelld sleeve of care
The death of each days life sore labours bath
Balm of hurt minds great natures second course
Chief nourisher in lifes feast
What do you mean
Still it cried Sleep no more to all the house
Glamis hath murderd sleep and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more
Who was it that thus cried Why worthy thane
You do unbend your noble strength to think
So brainsickly of things Go get some water
And wash this filthy witness from your hand
Why did you bring these daggers from the place
They must lie there go carry them and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood
Ill go no more
I am afraid to think what I have done
Look ont again I dare not
Infirm of purpose
Give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil If he do bleed
Ill gild the faces of the grooms withal
For it must seem their guilt
Exit Knocking within
Whence is that knocking
How ist with me when every noise appals me
What hands are here ha they pluck out mine eyes
Will all great Neptunes ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine
Making the green one red
Reenter LADY MACBETH
My hands are of your colour but I shame
To wear a heart so white
Knocking within
I hear a knocking
At the south entry retire we to our chamber
A little water clears us of this deed
How easy is it then Your constancy
Hath left you unattended
Knocking within
Hark more knocking

And show us to be watchers Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts
To know my deed twere best not know myself

Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX
Was it so late friend ere you went to bed
That you do lie so late
Faith sir we were carousing till the
second cock and drink sir is a great
provoker of three things
What three things does drink especially provoke
Marry sir nosepainting sleep and
urine Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes
it provokes the desire but it takes
away the performance therefore much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery
it makes him and it mars him it sets
him on and it takes him off it persuades him
and disheartens him makes him stand to and
not stand to in conclusion equivocates him
in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night
That it did sir i the very throat on
me but I requited him for his lie and I
think being too strong for him though he took
up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast
him
Is thy master stirring
Enter MACBETH
Our knocking has awaked him here he comes
Good morrow noble sir
Good morrow both
Is the king stirring worthy thane
Not yet
He did command me to call timely on him
I have almost slippd the hour
Ill bring you to him
I know this is a joyful trouble to you
But yet tis one
The labour we delight in physics pain
This is the door
Ill make so bold to call
For tis my limited service
Exit
Goes the king hence today
He does he did appoint so
The night has been unruly where we lay
Our chimneys were blown down and as they say
Lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatchd to the woeful time the obscure bird
Clamourd the livelong night some say the earth
Was feverous and did shake
Twas a rough night
My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it
Reenter MACDUFF
O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee
Whats the matter
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lords anointed temple and stole thence
The life o the building
What is t you say the life
Mean you his majesty
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon do not bid me speak
See and then speak yourselves
Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
Awake awake
Ring the alarumbell Murder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake
Shake off this downy sleep deaths counterfeit
And look on death itself up up and see
The great dooms image Malcolm Banquo
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
To countenance this horror Ring the bell
Bell rings
Enter LADY MACBETH
Whats the business
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house speak speak
O gentle lady
Tis not for you to hear what I can speak
The repetition in a womans ear
Would murder as it fell
Enter BANQUO
O Banquo Banquo
Our royal master s murderd
Woe alas
What in our house
Too cruel any where
Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself
And say it is not so
Reenter MACBETH and LENNOX with ROSS
Had I but died an hour before this chance
I had lived a blessed time for from this instant
There s nothing serious in mortality
All is but toys renown and grace is dead
The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of
Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN
What is amiss
You are and do not knowt
The spring the head the fountain of your blood
Is stoppd the very source of it is stoppd
Your royal father s murderd
O by whom
Those of his chamber as it seemd had done t
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood
So were their daggers which unwiped we found
Upon their pillows
Was to be trusted with them
O yet I do repent me of my fury
That I did kill them
Wherefore did you so
Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious
Loyal and neutral in a moment No man
The expedition my violent love
Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan
His silver skin laced with his golden blood
And his gashd stabs lookd like a breach in nature
For ruins wasteful entrance there the murderers
Steepd in the colours of their trade their daggers
Unmannerly breechd with gore who could refrain
That had a heart to love and in that heart
Courage to make s love kno wn
Help me hence ho
Look to the lady
Aside to DONALBAIN  Why do we hold our tongues
That most may claim this argument for ours
Aside to MALCOLM  What should be spoken here
where our fate
Hid in an augerhole may rush and seize us
Let s away
Our tears are not yet brewd
Aside to DONALBAIN        Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion
Look to the lady
LADY MACBETH is carried out
And when we have our naked frailties hid
That suffer in exposure let us meet
And question this most bloody piece of work
To know it further Fears and scruples shake us
In the great hand of God I stand and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice
And so do I
So all
Lets briefly put on manly readiness
And meet i the hall together
Well contented
Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain
What will you do Lets not consort with them
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy Ill to England
To Ireland I our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer where we are
Theres daggers in mens smiles the near in blood
The nearer bloody
This murderous shaft thats shot
Hath not yet lighted and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse
And let us not be dainty of leavetaking
But shift away theres warrant in that theft
Which steals itself when theres no mercy left
Exeunt
Enter ROSS and an old Man
Threescore and ten I can remember well
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings
Ah good father
Threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
Ist nights predominance or the days shame
That darkness does the face of earth entomb
When living light should kiss it
Tis unnatural
Even like the deed thats done On Tuesday last
A falcon towering in her pride of place
Was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killd
And Duncans horsesa thing most strange and certain
Beauteous and swift the minions of their race
Turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
Contending gainst obedience as they would make
War with mankind
Tis said they eat each other
They did so to the amazement of mine eyes
That lookd upont Here comes the good Macduff
Enter MACDUFF
How goes the world sir now
Why see you not
Ist known who did this more than bloody deed
Those that Macbeth hath slain
Alas the day
What good could they pretend
They were subornd
Malcolm and Donalbain the kings two sons
Are stoln away and fled which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed
Gainst nature still
Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
Thine own lifes means Then tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth
He is already named and gone to Scone
To be invested
Where is Duncans body
Carried to Colmekill
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
And guardian of their bones
Will you to Scone
No cousin Ill to Fife
Well I will thither
Well may you see things well done there adieu
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new
Farewell father
Gods benison go with you and with those
That would make good of bad and friends of foes
Exeunt
Enter BANQUO
Thou hast it now king Cawdor Glamis all
As the weird women promised and I fear
Thou playdst most foully fort yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings If there come truth from them
As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine
Why by the verities on thee made good
May they not be my oracles as well
And set me up in hope But hush no more
Sennet sounded Enter MACBETH as king LADY  MACBETH as queen LENNOX ROSS Lords Ladies and Attendants
Heres our chief guest
If he had been forgotten
It had been as a gap in our great feast
And allthing unbecoming
Tonight we hold a solemn supper sir
And Ill request your presence
Let your highness
Command upon me to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit
Ride you this afternoon
Ay my good lord
We should have else desired your good advice
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous
In this days council but well take tomorrow
Ist far you ride
As far my lord as will fill up the time
Twixt this and supper go not my horse the better
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain
Fail not our feast
My lord I will not
We hear our bloody cousins are bestowd
In England and in Ireland not confessing
Their cruel parricide filling their hearers
With strange invention but of that tomorrow
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly Hie you to horse adieu
Till you return at night Goes Fleance with you
Ay my good lord our time does call upon s
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot
And so I do commend you to their backs Farewell
Exit BANQUO

Till seven at night to make society
The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
Till suppertime alone while then God be with you
Exeunt all but MACBETH and an attendant
Sirrah a word with you attend those men
Our pleasure
They are my lord without the palace gate
Bring them before us
Exit Attendant
To be thus is nothing
But to be safely thusOur fears in Banquo
Stick deep and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be feard tis much he dares
And to that dauntless temper of his mind
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
Whose being I do fear and under him
My Genius is rebuked as it is said
Mark Antonys was by Caesar He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me
And bade them speak to him then prophetlike
They haild him father to a line of kings
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe
Thence to be wrenchd with an unlineal hand
No son of mine succeeding If t be so
For Banquos issue have I filed my mind
For them the gracious Duncan have I murderd
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man
To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings
Rather than so come fate into the list
And champion me to the utterance Whos there
Reenter Attendant with two Murderers
Now go to the door and stay there till we call
Exit Attendant
Was it not yesterday we spoke together
It was so please your highness
Well then now
Have you considerd of my speeches Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune which you thought had been
Our innocent self this I made good to you
In our last conference passd in probation with you
How you were borne in hand how crossd
the instruments
Who wrought with them and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say Thus did Banquo
You made it known to us
I did so and went further which is now
Our point of second meeting Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go Are you so gospelld
To pray for this good man and for his issue
Whose heavy hand hath bowd you to the grave
And beggard yours for ever
We are men my liege
Ay in the catalogue ye go for men
As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
Shoughs waterrugs and demiwolves are clept
All by the name of dogs the valued file
Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
The housekeeper the hunter every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed whereby he does receive
Particular addition from the bill
That writes them all alike and so of men
Now if you have a station in the file
Not i the worst rank of manhood say t
And I will put that business in your bosoms
Whose execution takes your enemy off
Grapples you to the heart and love of us
Who wear our health but sickly in his life
Which in his death were perfect
I am one my liege
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world
And I another
So weary with disasters tuggd with fortune
That I would set my lie on any chance
To mend it or be rid ont
Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy
True my lord
So is he mine and in such bloody distance
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my nearst of life and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it yet I must not
For certain friends that are both his and mine
Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down and thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons
We shall my lord
Perform what you command us
Though our lives
Your spirits shine through you Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time
The moment ont fort must be done tonight
And something from the palace always thought
That I require a clearness and with him
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work
Fleance his son that keeps him company
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his fathers must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart
Ill come to you anon
We are resolved my lord
Ill call upon you straight abide within
Exeunt Murderers
It is concluded Banquo thy souls flight
If it find heaven must find it out tonight
Exit
Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant
Is Banquo gone from court
Ay madam but returns again tonight
Say to the king I would attend his leisure
For a few words
Madam I will
Exit
Noughts had alls spent
Where our desire is got without content
Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
Enter MACBETH
How now my lord why do you keep alone
Of sorriest fancies your companions making
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on Things without all remedy
Should be without regard whats done is done
We have scotchd the snake not killd it
Shell close and be herself whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth
But let the frame of things disjoint both the
worlds suffer
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly better be with the dead
Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave
After lifes fitful fever he sleeps well
Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
Malice domestic foreign levy nothing
Can touch him further
Come on
Gentle my lord sleek oer your rugged looks
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
So shall I love and so I pray be you
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo
Present him eminence both with eye and tongue
Unsafe the while that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams
And make our faces vizards to our hearts
Disguising what they are
You must leave this
O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
Thou knowst that Banquo and his Fleance lives
But in them natures copys not eterne
Theres comfort yet they are assailable
Then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown
His cloisterd flight ere to black Hecates summons
The shardborne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung nights yawning peal there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note
Whats to be done
Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse
While nights black agents to their preys do rouse
Thou marvellst at my words but hold thee still
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
So prithee go with me
Exeunt
Enter three Murderers
But who did bid thee join with us
Macbeth
He needs not our mistrust since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just
Then stand with us
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day
Now spurs the lated traveller apace
To gain the timely inn and near approaches
The subject of our watch
Hark I hear horses
Within  Give us a light there ho
Then tis he the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i the court
His horses go about
Almost a mile but he does usually
So all men do from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk
A light a light
Enter BANQUO and FLEANCE with a torch
Tis he
Stand tot
It will be rain tonight
Let it come down
They set upon BANQUO
O treachery Fly good Fleance fly fly fly
Thou mayst revenge O slave
Dies FLEANCE escapes
Who did strike out the light
Wast not the way
Theres but one down the son is fled
We have lost
Best half of our affair
Well lets away and say how much is done
Exeunt
A banquet prepared Enter MACBETH LADY MACBETH ROSS LENNOX Lords and Attendants
You know your own degrees sit down at first
And last the hearty welcome
Thanks to your majesty
Ourself will mingle with society
And play the humble host
Our hostess keeps her state but in best time
We will require her welcome
Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends
For my heart speaks they are welcome
First Murderer appears at the door
See they encounter thee with their hearts thanks
Both sides are even here Ill sit i the midst
Be large in mirth anon well drink a measure
The table round
Approaching the door
Theres blood on thy face
Tis Banquos then
Tis better thee without than he within
Is he dispatchd
My lord his throat is cut that I did for him
Thou art the best o the cutthroats yet hes good
That did the like for Fleance if thou didst it
Thou art the nonpareil
Most royal sir
Fleance is scaped
Then comes my fit again I had else been perfect
Whole as the marble founded as the rock
As broad and general as the casing air
But now I am cabind cribbd confined bound in
To saucy doubts and fears But Banquos safe
Ay my good lord safe in a ditch he bides
With twenty trenched gashes on his head
The least a death to nature
Thanks for that
There the grown serpent lies the worm thats fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed
No teeth for the present Get thee gone tomorrow
Well hear ourselves again
Exit Murderer
My royal lord
You do not give the cheer the feast is sold
That is not often vouchd while tis amaking
Tis given with welcome to feed were best at home
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony
Meeting were bare without it
Sweet remembrancer
Now good digestion wait on appetite
And health on both
Mayt please your highness sit
The GHOST OF BANQUO enters and sits in MACBETHs place
Here had we now our countrys honour roofd
Were the graced person of our Banquo present
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance
His absence sir
Lays blame upon his promise Pleaset your highness
To grace us with your royal company
The tables full
Here is a place reserved sir
Where
Here my good lord What ist that moves your highness
Which of you have done this
What my good lord
Thou canst not say I did it never shake
Thy gory locks at me
Gentlemen rise his highness is not well
Sit worthy friends my lord is often thus
And hath been from his youth pray you keep seat
The fit is momentary upon a thought
He will again be well if much you note him
You shall offend him and extend his passion
Feed and regard him not Are you a man
Ay and a bold one that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil
O proper stuff
This is the very painting of your fear
This is the airdrawn dagger which you said
Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts
Impostors to true fear would well become
A womans story at a winters fire
Authorized by her grandam Shame itself
Why do you make such faces When alls done
You look but on a stool
Prithee see there behold look lo
how say you
Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too
If charnelhouses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
What quite unmannd in folly
If I stand here I saw him
Fie for shame
Blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal
Ay and since too murders have been performd
Too terrible for the ear the times have been
That when the brains were out the man would die
And there an end but now they rise again
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns
And push us from our stools this is more strange
Than such a murder is
My worthy lord
Your noble friends do lack you
I do forget
Do not muse at me my most worthy friends
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing
To those that know me Come love and health to all
Then Ill sit down Give me some wine fill full
I drink to the general joy o the whole table
And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
Would he were here to all and him we thirst
And all to all
Our duties and the pledge
Reenter GHOST OF BANQUO
Avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee
Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with
Think of this good peers
But as a thing of custom tis no other
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time
What man dare I dare
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear
The armd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger
Take any shape but that and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble or be alive again
And dare me to the desert with thy sword
If trembling I inhabit then protest me
The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow
Unreal mockery hence
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
Why so being gone
I am a man again Pray you sit still
You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting
With most admired disorder
Can such things be
And overcome us like a summers cloud
Without our special wonder You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe
When now I think you can behold such sights
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
When mine is blanched with fear
What sights my lord
I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
Question enrages him At once good night
Stand not upon the order of your going
But go at once
Good night and better health
Attend his majesty
A kind good night to all
Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH
It will have blood they say blood will have blood
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
Augurs and understood relations have
By magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secretst man of blood What is the night
Almost at odds with morning which is which
How sayst thou that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding
Did you send to him sir
I hear it by the way but I will send
Theres not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant feed I will tomorrow
And betimes I will to the weird sisters
More shall they speak for now I am bent to know
By the worst means the worst For mine own good
All causes shall give way I am in blood
Steppd in so far that should I wade no more
Returning were as tedious as go oer
Strange things I have in head that will to hand
You lack the season of all natures sleep
Come well to sleep My strange and selfabuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
We are yet but young in deed
Exeunt
Thunder Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE
Why how now Hecate you look angerly
Have I not reason beldams as you are
Saucy and overbold How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death
And I the mistress of your charms
The close contriver of all harms
Was never calld to bear my part
Or show the glory of our art
And which is worse all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son
Spiteful and wrathful who as others do
Loves for his own ends not for you
But make amends now get you gone
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i the morning thither he
Will come to know his destiny
Your vessels and your spells provide
Your charms and every thing beside
I am for the air this night Ill spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end
Great business must be wrought ere noon
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vaporous drop profound
Ill catch it ere it come to ground
And that distilld by magic sleights
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion
He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
He hopes bove wisdom grace and fear
And you all know security
Is mortals chiefest enemy
Music and a song within Come away come away  and c
Hark I am calld my little spirit see
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me
Exit
Come lets make haste shell soon be back again
Exeunt
Enter LENNOX and another Lord
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts
Which can interpret further only I say
Things have been strangely borne The
gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead
And the rightvaliant Banquo walkd too late
Whom you may say ift please you Fleance killd
For Fleance fled men must not walk too late
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
How it did grieve Macbeth did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too
For twould have angerd any heart alive
To hear the men denyt So that I say
He has borne all things well and I do think
That had he Duncans sons under his key
As ant please heaven he shall notthey
should find
What twere to kill a father so should Fleance
But peace for from broad words and cause he faild
His presence at the tyrants feast I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell
Where he bestows himself
The son of Duncan
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
Lives in the English court and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
That by the help of thesewith Him above
To ratify the workwe may again
Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
Do faithful homage and receive free honours
All which we pine for now and this report
Hath so exasperate the king that he
Prepares for some attempt of war
Sent he to Macduff
He did and with an absolute Sir not I
The cloudy messenger turns me his back
And hums as who should say Youll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer
And that well might
Advise him to a caution to hold what distance
His wisdom can provide Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed
Ill send my prayers with him
Exeunt
Thunder Enter the three Witches
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewd
Thrice and once the hedgepig whined
Harpier cries Tis time tis time
Round about the cauldron go
In the poisond entrails throw
Toad that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirtyone
Swelterd venom sleeping got
Boil thou first i the charmed pot
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Fillet of a fenny snake
In the cauldron boil and bake
Eye of newt and toe of frog
Wool of bat and tongue of dog
Adders fork and blindworms sting
Lizards leg and owlets wing
For a charm of powerful trouble
Like a hellbroth boil and bubble
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Scale of dragon tooth of wolf
Witches mummy maw and gulf
Of the ravind saltsea shark
Root of hemlock diggd i the dark
Liver of blaspheming Jew
Gall of goat and slips of yew
Silverd in the moons eclipse
Nose of Turk and Tartars lips
Finger of birthstrangled babe
Ditchdeliverd by a drab
Make the gruel thick and slab
Add thereto a tigers chaudron
For the ingredients of our cauldron
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Cool it with a baboons blood
Then the charm is firm and good
Enter HECATE to the other three Witches
O well done I commend your pains
And every one shall share i the gains
And now about the cauldron sing
Live elves and fairies in a ring
Enchanting all that you put in
Music and a song Black spirits  and c
HECATE retires
By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
Open locks
Whoever knocks
Enter MACBETH
How now you secret black and midnight hags
What ist you do
A deed without a name
I conjure you by that which you profess
Howeer you come to know it answer me
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down
Though castles topple on their warders heads
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations though the treasure
Of natures germens tumble all together
Even till destruction sicken answer me
To what I ask you
Speak
Demand
Well answer
Say if thoudst rather hear it from our mouths
Or from our masters
Call em let me see em
Pour in sows blood that hath eaten
Her nine farrow grease thats sweaten
From the murderers gibbet throw
Into the flame
Come high or low
Thyself and office deftly show
Thunder First Apparition an armed Head
Tell me thou unknown power
He knows thy thought
Hear his speech but say thou nought
Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth beware Macduff
Beware the thane of Fife Dismiss me Enough
Descends
Whateer thou art for thy good caution thanks
Thou hast harpd my fear aright but one
word more
He will not be commanded heres another
More potent than the first
Thunder Second Apparition A bloody Child
Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth
Had I three ears Ild hear thee
Be bloody bold and resolute laugh to scorn
The power of man for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth
Descends
Then live Macduff what need I fear of thee
But yet Ill make assurance double sure
And take a bond of fate thou shalt not live
That I may tell palehearted fear it lies
And sleep in spite of thunder
Thunder Third Apparition a Child crowned with a tree in his hand
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king
And wears upon his babybrow the round
And top of sovereignty
Listen but speak not tot
Be lionmettled proud and take no care
Who chafes who frets or where conspirers are
Macbeth shall never vanquishd be until
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him
Descends
That will never be
Who can impress the forest bid the tree
Unfix his earthbound root Sweet bodements good
Rebellions head rise never till the wood
Of Birnam rise and our highplaced Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath
To time and mortal custom Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing tell me if your art
Can tell so much shall Banquos issue ever
Reign in this kingdom
Seek to know no more
I will be satisfied deny me this
And an eternal curse fall on you Let me know
Why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this
Hautboys
Show
Show
Show
Show his eyes and grieve his heart
Come like shadows so depart
A show of Eight Kings the last with a glass in his hand GHOST OF BANQUO following
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo down
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs And thy hair
Thou other goldbound brow is like the first
A third is like the former Filthy hags
Why do you show me this A fourth Start eyes
What will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
Another yet A seventh Ill see no more
And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
Which shows me many more and some I see
That twofold balls and treble scepters carry
Horrible sight Now I see tis true
For the bloodbolterd Banquo smiles upon me
And points at them for his
Apparitions vanish
What is this so
Ay sir all this is so but why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly
Come sisters cheer we up his sprites
And show the best of our delights
Ill charm the air to give a sound
While you perform your antic round
That this great king may kindly say
Our duties did his welcome pay
Music The witches dance and then vanish with HECATE
Where are they Gone Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar
Come in without there
Enter LENNOX
Whats your graces will
Saw you the weird sisters
No my lord
Came they not by you
No indeed my lord
Infected be the air whereon they ride
And damnd all those that trust them I did hear
The galloping of horse who wast came by
Tis two or three my lord that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England
Fled to England
Ay my good lord
Time thou anticipatest my dread exploits
The flighty purpose never is oertook
Unless the deed go with it from this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand And even now
The castle of Macduff I will surprise
Seize upon Fife give to the edge o the sword
His wife his babes and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line No boasting like a fool
This deed Ill do before this purpose cool
But no more sightsWhere are these gentlemen
Come bring me where they are
Exeunt
Enter LADY MACDUFF her Son and ROSS
What had he done to make him fly the land
You must have patience madam
He had none
Our fears do make us traitors
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear
Wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly He loves us not
He wants the natural touch for the poor wren
The most diminutive of birds will fight
Her young ones in her nest against the owl
All is the fear and nothing is the love
As little is the wisdom where the flight
So runs against all reason
My dearest coz
I pray you school yourself but for your husband
He is noble wise judicious and best knows
The fits o the season I dare not speak
much further
But cruel are the times when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves when we hold rumour
From what we fear yet know not what we fear
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move I take my leave of you
Shall not be long but Ill be here again
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
To what they were before My pretty cousin
Blessing upon you
Fatherd he is and yet hes fatherless
I am so much a fool should I stay longer
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
I take my leave at once
Exit
Sirrah your fathers dead
And what will you do now How will you live
As birds do mother
What with worms and flies
With what I get I mean and so do they
Poor bird thouldst never fear the net nor lime
The pitfall nor the gin
Why should I mother Poor birds they are not set for
My father is not dead for all your saying
Yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father
Nay how will you do for a husband
Why I can buy me twenty at any market
Then youll buy em to sell again
Thou speakst with all thy wit and yet i faith
With wit enough for thee
Was my father a traitor mother
Ay that he was
What is a traitor
Why one that swears and lies
And be all traitors that do so
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
Every one
Who must hang them
Why  the honest men
Then the liars and swearers are fools
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
the honest men and hang up them
Now God help thee poor monkey
But how wilt thou do for a father
If he were dead yould weep for
him if you would not it were a good sign
that I should quickly have a new father
Poor prattler how thou talkst
Enter a Messenger
Bless you fair dame I am not to you known
Though in your state of honour I am perfect
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
If you will take a homely mans advice
Be not found here hence with your little ones
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage
To do worse to you were fell cruelty
Which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you
I dare abide no longer
Exit
Whither should I fly
I have done no harm But I remember now
I am in this earthly world where to do harm
Is often laudable to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly why then alas
Do I put up that womanly defence
To say I have done no harm
Enter Murderers
What are these faces
Where is your husband
I hope in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him
Hes a traitor
Thou liest thou shaghaird villain
What you egg
Stabbing him
Young fry of treachery
He has killd me mother
Run away I pray you
Dies
Exit LADY MACDUFF crying Murder Exeunt Murderers following her
Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
Bestride our downfalln birthdom each new morn
New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yelld out
Like syllable of dolour
What I believe Ill wail
What know believe and what I can redress
As I shall find the time to friend I will
What you have spoke it may be so perchance
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
Was once thought honest you have loved him well
He hath not touchd you yet I am young
but something
You may deserve of him through me and wisdom
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god
I am not treacherous
But Macbeth is
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge But I shall crave
your pardon
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
Yet grace must still look so
I have lost my hopes
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts
Why in that rawness left you wife and child
Those precious motives those strong knots of love
Without leavetaking I pray you
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours
But mine own safeties You may be rightly just
Whatever I shall think
Bleed bleed poor country
Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
For goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou
thy wrongs
The title is affeerd Fare thee well lord
I would not be the villain that thou thinkst
For the whole space thats in the tyrants grasp
And the rich East to boot
Be not offended
I speak not as in absolute fear of you
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke
It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands but for all this
When I shall tread upon the tyrants head
Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever
By him that shall succeed
What should he be
It is myself I mean in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That when they shall be opend black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb being compared
With my confineless harms
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd
In evils to top Macbeth
I grant him bloody
Luxurious avaricious false deceitful
Sudden malicious smacking of every sin
That has a name but theres no bottom none
In my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
Your matrons and your maids could not fill up
The cistern of my lust and my desire
All continent impediments would oerbear
That did oppose my will better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign
Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
We have willing dames enough there cannot be
That vulture in you to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves
Finding it so inclined
With this there grows
In my most illcomposed affection such
A stanchless avarice that were I king
I should cut off the nobles for their lands
Desire his jewels and this others house
And my morehaving would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
Destroying them for wealth
This avarice
Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
Than summerseeming lust and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings yet do not fear
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
Of your mere own all these are portable
With other graces weighd
But I have none the kingbecoming graces
As justice verity temperance stableness
Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
Devotion patience courage fortitude
I have no relish of them but abound
In the division of each several crime
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
Uproar the universal peace confound
All unity on earth
O Scotland Scotland
If such a one be fit to govern speak
I am as I have spoken
Fit to govern
No not to live O nation miserable
With an untitled tyrant bloodyscepterd
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed
And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet
Died every day she lived Fare thee well
These evils thou repeatst upon thyself
Have banishd me from Scotland O my breast
Thy hope ends here
Macduff this noble passion
Child of integrity hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
From overcredulous haste but God above
Deal between thee and me for even now
I put myself to thy direction and
The taints and blames I laid upon myself
For strangers to my nature I am yet
Unknown to woman never was forsworn
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own
At no time broke my faith would not betray
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life my first false speaking
Was this upon myself what I am truly
Is thine and my poor countrys to command
Whither indeed before thy hereapproach
Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men
Already at a point was setting forth
Now well together and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
Tis hard to reconcile
Enter a Doctor
Well more anonComes the king forth I pray you
Ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure their malady convinces
The great assay of art but at his touch
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
They presently amend
I thank you doctor
Exit Doctor
Whats the disease he means
Tis calld the evil
A most miraculous work in this good king
Which often since my hereremain in England
I have seen him do How he solicits heaven
Himself best knows but strangelyvisited people
All swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
The mere despair of surgery he cures
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
Put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction With this strange virtue
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
And sundry blessings hang about his throne
That speak him full of grace
Enter ROSS
See who comes here
My countryman but yet I know him not
My evergentle cousin welcome hither
I know him now Good God betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers
Sir amen
Stands Scotland where it did
Alas poor country
Almost afraid to know itself It cannot
Be calld our mother but our grave where nothing
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made not markd where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy the dead mans knell
Is there scarce askd for who and good mens lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps
Dying or ere they sicken
O relation
Too nice and yet too true
Whats the newest grief
That of an hours age doth hiss the speaker
Each minute teems a new one
How does my wife
Why well
And all my children
Well too
The tyrant has not batterd at their peace
No they were well at peace when I did leave em
But not a niggard of your speech how goest
When I came hither to transport the tidings
Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out
Which was to my belief witnessd the rather
For that I saw the tyrants power afoot
Now is the time of help your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers make our women fight
To doff their dire distresses
Bet their comfort
We are coming thither gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out
Would I could answer
This comfort with the like But I have words
That would be howld out in the desert air
Where hearing should not latch them
What concern they
The general cause or is it a feegrief
Due to some single breast
No mind thats honest
But in it shares some woe though the main part
Pertains to you alone
If it be mine
Keep it not from me quickly let me have it
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard
Hum I guess at it
Your castle is surprised your wife and babes
Savagely slaughterd to relate the manner
Were on the quarry of these murderd deer
To add the death of you
Merciful heaven
What man neer pull your hat upon your brows
Give sorrow words the grief that does not speak
Whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break
My children too
Wife children servants all
That could be found
And I must be from thence
My wife killd too
I have said
Be comforted
Lets make us medicines of our great revenge
To cure this deadly grief
He has no children All my pretty ones
Did you say all O hellkite All
What all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop
Dispute it like a man
I shall do so
But I must also feel it as a man
I cannot but remember such things were
That were most precious to me Did heaven look on
And would not take their part Sinful Macduff
They were all struck for thee naught that I am
Not for their own demerits but for mine
Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now
Be this the whetstone of your sword let grief
Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
O I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens
Cut short all intermission front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
Within my swords length set him if he scape
Heaven forgive him too
This tune goes manly
Come go we to the king our power is ready
Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking and the powers above
Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may
The night is long that never finds the day
Exeunt
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a WaitingGentlewoman
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive
no truth in your report When was it she last walked
Since his majesty went into the field I have seen
her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon
her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it
write upont read it afterwards seal it and again
return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep
A great perturbation in nature to receive at once
the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
watching In this slumbery agitation besides her
time have you heard her say
That sir which I will not report after her
You may to me and tis most meet you should
Neither to you nor any one having no witness to
confirm my speech
Enter LADY MACBETH with a taper
Lo you here she comes This is her very guise
and upon my life fast asleep Observe her stand close
How came she by that light
Why it stood by her she has light by her
continually tis her command
You see her eyes are open
Ay but their sense is shut
What is it she does now Look how she rubs her hands
washing her hands I have known her continue in
this a quarter of an hour
Yet heres a spot
Hark she speaks I will set down what comes from
her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
Out damned spot out I sayOne two why
then tis time to dotHell is murkyFie my
lord fie a soldier and afeard What need we
fear who knows it when none can call our power to
accountYet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him
Do you mark that
The thane of Fife had a wife where is she now
What will these hands neer be cleanNo more o
that my lord no more o that you mar all with
this starting
Go to go to you have known what you should not
She has spoke what she should not I am sure of
that heaven knows what she has known
Heres the smell of the blood still all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand Oh oh oh
What a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body
Well well well
Pray God it be sir

holily in their beds
Wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so

done cannot be undoneTo bed to bed to bed
Exit
Will she go now to bed
Directly
Foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
More needs she the divine than the physician

Remove from her the means of all annoyance
And still keep eyes upon her So good night
My mind she has mated and amazed my sight
I think but dare not speak
Good night good doctor

Drum and colours Enter MENTEITH CAITHNESS ANGUS LENNOX and Soldiers
The English power is near led on by Malcolm
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
Revenges burn in them for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man
Near Birnam wood
Shall we well meet them that way are they coming
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother
For certain sir he is not I have a file
Of all the gentry there is Siwards son
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood
What does the tyrant
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
Some say hes mad others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury but for certain
He cannot buckle his distemperd cause
Within the belt of rule
Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach
Those he commands move only in command
Nothing in love now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him like a giants robe
Upon a dwarfish thief
Who then shall blame
His pesterd senses to recoil and start
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there
Well march we on
To give obedience where tis truly owed
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
And with him pour we in our countrys purge
Each drop of us
Or so much as it needs
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
Make we our march towards Birnam
Exeunt marching
Enter MACBETH Doctor and Attendants
Bring me no more reports let them fly all
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear Whats the boy Malcolm
Was he not born of woman The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus
Fear not Macbeth no man thats born of woman
Shall eer have power upon thee Then fly
false thanes
And mingle with the English epicures
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear

Take thy face hence
Exit Servant
SeytonI am sick at heart
When I beholdSeyton I sayThis push
Will cheer me ever or disseat me now
I have lived long enough my way of life
Is falln into the sear the yellow leaf
And that which should accompany old age
As honour love obedience troops of friends
I must not look to have but in their stead
Curses not loud but deep mouthhonour breath
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not Seyton
Enter SEYTON
What is your gracious pleasure
What news more
All is confirmd my lord which was reported
Ill fight till from my bones my flesh be hackd
Give me my armour
Tis not needed yet
Ill put it on
Send out more horses skirr the country round
Hang those that talk of fear Give me mine armour
How does your patient doctor
Not so sick my lord
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies
That keep her from her rest
Cure her of that
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart
Therein the patient
Must minister to himself
Throw physic to the dogs Ill none of it
Come put mine armour on give me my staff
Seyton send out Doctor the thanes fly from me
Come sir dispatch If thou couldst doctor cast
The water of my land find her disease
And purge it to a sound and pristine health
I would applaud thee to the very echo
That should applaud againPullt off I say
What rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug
Would scour these English hence Hearst thou of them
Ay my good lord your royal preparation
Makes us hear something

Cousins I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe
We doubt it nothing
What wood is this before us
The wood of Birnam
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And beart before him thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us
It shall be done
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
Our setting down before t
Tis his main hope
For where there is advantage to be given
Both more and less have given him the revolt
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too
Let our just censures
Attend the true event and put we on
Industrious soldiership
The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate
Towards which advance the war
Exeunt marching
Enter MACBETH SEYTON and Soldiers with drum and colours
Hang out our banners on the outward walls
The cry is still They come our castles strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up
Were they not forced with those that should be ours
We might have met them dareful beard to beard
And beat them backward home
A cry of women within
What is that noise
It is the cry of women my good lord
Exit
I have almost forgot the taste of fears
The time has been my senses would have coold
To hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were int I have suppd full with horrors
Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
Cannot once start me
Reenter SEYTON
Wherefore was that cry
The queen my lord is dead
She should have died hereafter
There would have been a time for such a word
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death Out out brief candle
Lifes but a walking shadow a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more it is a tale
Told by an idiot full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing
Enter a Messenger
Thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly
Gracious my lord
I should report that which I say I saw
But know not how to do it
Well say sir
As I did stand my watch upon the hill
I lookd toward Birnam and anon methought
The wood began to move
Liar and slave
Let me endure your wrath ift be not so
Within this three mile may you see it coming
I say a moving grove
If thou speakst false
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
Till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
I care not if thou dost for me as much
I pull in resolution and begin
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
That lies like truth Fear not till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane  and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out
If this which he avouches does appear
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
I gin to be aweary of the sun
And wish the estate o the world were now undone
Ring the alarumbell Blow wind come wrack
At least well die with harness on our back
Exeunt

Shall with my cousin your rightnoble son
Lead our first battle worthy Macduff and we

According to our order
Fare you well
Do we but find the tyrants power tonight
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight
Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath

Alarums Enter MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake I cannot fly
But bearlike I must fight the course Whats he
That was not born of woman Such a one
Am I to fear or none
Enter YOUNG SIWARD
What is thy name
Thoult be afraid to hear it
No though thou callst thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell
My names Macbeth
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear
No nor more fearful
Thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword
Ill prove the lie thou speakst
They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain
Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn
Brandishd by man thats of a woman born
Exit
Alarums Enter MACDUFF
That way the noise is Tyrant show thy face
If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine
My wife and childrens ghosts will haunt me still
I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves either thou Macbeth
Or else my sword with an unbatterd edge
I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be
By this great clatter one of greatest note
Seems bruited Let me find him fortune
And more I beg not
Exit Alarums
Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD
This way my lord the castles gently renderd

The noble thanes do bravely in the war

That strike beside us
Enter sir the castle
Exeunt Alarums

Why should I play the Roman fool and die
On mine own sword whiles I see lives the gashes
Do better upon them
Enter MACDUFF
Turn hellhound turn
Of all men else I have avoided thee
But get thee back my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already
I have no words
My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out
They fight
Thou losest labour
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
I bear a charmed life which must not yield
To one of woman born
Despair thy charm
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee Macduff was from his mothers womb
Untimely rippd
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so
For it hath cowd my better part of man
And be these juggling fiends no more believed
That palter with us in a double sense
That keep the word of promise to our ear
And break it to our hope Ill not fight with thee
Then yield thee coward
And live to be the show and gaze o the time
Well have thee as our rarer monsters are
Painted on a pole and underwrit
Here may you see the tyrant
I will not yield
To kiss the ground before young Malcolms feet
And to be baited with the rabbles curse
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane
And thou opposed being of no woman born
Yet I will try the last Before my body
I throw my warlike shield Lay on Macduff
And damnd be him that first cries Hold enough
Exeunt fighting Alarums
Retreat Flourish Enter with drum and colours MALCOLM SIWARD ROSS the other Thanes and Soldiers
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived
Some must go off and yet by these I see
So great a day as this is cheaply bought
Macduff is missing and your noble son
Your son my lord has paid a soldiers debt
He only lived but till he was a man
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmd
In the unshrinking station where he fought
But like a man he died
Then he is dead
Ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth for then
It hath no end
Had he his hurts before
Ay on the front
Why then Gods soldier be he
Had I as many sons as I have hairs
I would not wish them to a fairer death
And so his knell is knolld
Hes worth more sorrow
And that Ill spend for him
Hes worth no more
They say he parted well and paid his score
And so God be with him Here comes newer comfort
Reenter MACDUFF with MACBETHs head
Hail king for so thou art behold where stands
The usurpers cursed head the time is free
I see thee compassd with thy kingdoms pearl
That speak my salutation in their minds
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine
Hail King of Scotland
Hail King of Scotland
Flourish
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves
And make us even with you My thanes and kinsmen
Henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour named Whats more to do
Which would be planted newly with the time
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen
Who as tis thought by self and violent hands
Took off her life this and what needful else
That calls upon us by the grace of Grace
We will perform in measure time and place
So thanks to all at once and to each one
Whom we invite to see us crownd at Scone

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO ESCALUS Lords and Attendants
Escalus
My lord
Of government the properties to unfold
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds in that the lists of all advice
My strength can give you then no more remains
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able
And let them work The nature of our people
Our citys institutions and the terms
For common justice youre as pregnant in
That we remember There is our commission
From which we would not have you warp Call hither
I say bid come before us Angelo
Exit an Attendant
What figure of us think you he will bear
For you must know we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply
Lent him our terror dressd him with our love
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power what think you of it
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour
It is Lord Angelo
Look where he comes
Enter ANGELO
Always obedient to your graces will
I come to know your pleasure
Angelo
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do
Not light them for themselves for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us twere all alike
As if we had them not Spirits are not finely touchd
But to fine issues nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But like a thrifty goddess she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor
Both thanks and use But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise
Hold therefore Angelo
In our remove be thou at full ourself
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart old Escalus
Though first in question is thy secondary
Take thy commission
Now good my lord
Let there be some more test made of my metal
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stampd upon it
No more evasion
We have with a leavend and prepared choice
Proceeded to you therefore take your honours
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestiond
Matters of needful value We shall write to you
As time and our concernings shall importune
How it goes with us and do look to know
What doth befall you here So fare you well
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions
Yet give leave my lord
That we may bring you something on the way
My haste may not admit it
Nor need you on mine honour have to do
With any scruple your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good Give me your hand
Ill privily away I love the people
But do not like to stage me to their eyes
Through it do well I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it Once more fare you well
The heavens give safety to your purposes
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness
I thank you Fare you well
Exit
I shall desire you sir to give me leave
To have free speech with you and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place
A power I have but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed
Tis so with me Let us withdraw together
Touching that point
Ill wait upon your honour
Exeunt
Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
If the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary why then all
the dukes fall upon the king
Heaven grant us its peace but not the King of
Hungarys
Amen
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments but scraped
one out of the table
Thou shalt not steal
Ay that he razed
Why twas a commandment to command the captain and
all the rest from their functions they put forth
to steal Theres not a soldier of us all that in
the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition
well that prays for peace
I never heard any soldier dislike it
I believe thee for I think thou never wast where
grace was said
No a dozen times at least
What in metre
In any proportion or in any language
I think or in any religion
Ay why not Grace is grace despite of all
controversy as for example thou thyself art a
wicked villain despite of all grace
Well there went but a pair of shears between us
I grant as there may between the lists and the
velvet Thou art the list
And thou the velvet thou art good velvet thourt
a threepiled piece I warrant thee I had as lief
be a list of an English kersey as be piled as thou
art piled for a French velvet Do I speak
feelingly now
I think thou dost and indeed with most painful
feeling of thy speech I will out of thine own
confession learn to begin thy health but whilst I
live forget to drink after thee
I think I have done myself wrong have I not
Yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free
Behold behold where Madam Mitigation comes I
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to
To what I pray
Judge
To three thousand dolours a year
Ay and more
A French crown more
Thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou
art full of error I am sound
Nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as
things that are hollow thy bones are hollow
impiety has made a feast of thee
Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE
How now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica
Well well theres one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all
Whos that I pray thee
Marry sir thats Claudio Signior Claudio
Claudio to prison tis not so
Nay but I know tis so I saw him arrested saw
him carried away and which is more within these
three days his head to be chopped off
But after all this fooling I would not have it so
Art thou sure of this
I am too sure of it and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child
Believe me this may be he promised to meet me two
hours since and he was ever precise in
promisekeeping
Besides you know it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation
Away lets go learn the truth of it
Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen
Thus what with the war what with the sweat what
with the gallows and what with poverty I am
customshrunk
Enter POMPEY
How now whats the news with you
Yonder man is carried to prison
Well what has he done
A woman
But whats his offence
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river
What is there a maid with child by him
No but theres a woman with maid by him You have
not heard of the proclamation have you
What proclamation man
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down
And what shall become of those in the city
They shall stand for seed they had gone down too
but that a wise burgher put in for them
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down
To the ground mistress
Why heres a change indeed in the commonwealth
What shall become of me
Come fear you not good counsellors lack no
clients though you change your place you need not
change your trade Ill be your tapster still
Courage there will be pity taken on you you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the service you
will be considered
Whats to do here Thomas tapster lets withdraw
Here comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to
prison and theres Madam Juliet
Exeunt
Enter Provost CLAUDIO JULIET and Officers
Fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world
Bear me to prison where I am committed
I do it not in evil disposition
But from Lord Angelo by special charge
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven on whom it will it will
On whom it will not so yet still tis just
Reenter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
Why how now Claudio whence comes this restraint
From too much liberty my Lucio liberty
As surfeit is the father of much fast
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint Our natures do pursue
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane
A thirsty evil and when we drink we die
If could speak so wisely under an arrest I would
send for certain of my creditors and yet to say
the truth I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment Whats thy
offence Claudio
What but to speak of would offend again
What ist murder
No
Lechery
Call it so
Away sir you must go
One word good friend Lucio a word with you
A hundred if theyll do you any good
Is lechery so lookd after
I got possession of Juliettas bed
You know the lady she is fast my wife
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order this we came not to
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With child perhaps
Unhappily even so
And the new deputy now for the duke
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride
Who newly in the seat that it may know
He can command lets it straight feel the spur
Whether the tyranny be in his place
Or in his emmence that fills it up
I stagger inbut this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have like unscourd armour hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn and for a name
Freshly on me tis surely for a name
I warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love
may sigh it off Send after the duke and appeal to
him
I have done so but hes not to be found
I prithee Lucio do me this kind service
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation
Acquaint her with the danger of my state
Implore her in my voice that she make friends
To the strict deputy bid herself assay him
I have great hope in that for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect
Such as move men beside she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse
And well she can persuade
I pray she may as well for the encouragement of the
like which else would stand under grievous
imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of ticktack Ill to her
I thank you good friend Lucio
Within two hours
Come officer away
Exeunt
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS
No holy father throw away that thought
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth
May your grace speak of it
My holy sir none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps
I have deliverd to Lord Angelo
A man of stricture and firm abstinence
My absolute power and place here in Vienna
And he supposes me travelld to Poland
For so I have strewd it in the common ear
And so it is received Now pious sir
You will demand of me why I do this
Gladly my lord
We have strict statutes and most biting laws
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip
Even like an oergrown lion in a cave
That goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch
Only to stick it in their childrens sight
For terror not to use in time the rod
Becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees
Dead to infliction to themselves are dead
And liberty plucks justice by the nose
The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
Goes all decorum
It rested in your grace
To unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased
And it in you more dreadful would have seemd
Than in Lord Angelo
I do fear too dreadful
Sith twas my fault to give the people scope
Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do for we bid this be done
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment Therefore indeed my father
I have on Angelo imposed the office
Who may in the ambush of my name strike home
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander And to behold his sway
I will as twere a brother of your order
Visit both prince and people therefore I prithee
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
At our more leisure shall I render you
Only this one Lord Angelo is precise
Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
That his blood flows or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone hence shall we see
If power change purpose what our seemers be
Exeunt
Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA
And have you nuns no farther privileges
Are not these large enough
Yes truly I speak not as desiring more
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare
Within  Ho Peace be in this place
Whos that which calls
It is a mans voice Gentle Isabella
Turn you the key and know his business of him
You may I may not you are yet unsworn
When you have vowd you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress
Then if you speak you must not show your face
Or if you show your face you must not speak
He calls again I pray you answer him
Exit
Peace and prosperity Who ist that calls
Enter LUCIO
Hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses
Proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio
Why her unhappy brother let me ask
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister
Gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
Not to be weary with you hes in prison
Woe me for what
For that which if myself might be his judge
He should receive his punishment in thanks
He hath got his friend with child
Sir make me not your story
It is true
I would notthough tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
Tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so
I hold you as a thing enskyd and sainted
By your renouncement an immortal spirit
And to be talkd with in sincerity
As with a saint
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me
Do not believe it Fewness and truth tis thus
Your brother and his lover have embraced
As those that feed grow full as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
Some one with child by him My cousin Juliet
Is she your cousin
Adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names
By vain though apt affection
She it is
O let him marry her
This is the point
The duke is very strangely gone from hence
Bore many gentlemen myself being one
By those that know the very nerves of state
His givingsout were of an infinite distance
From his truemeant design Upon his place
And with full line of his authority
Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood
Is very snowbroth one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind study and fast
Heto give fear to use and liberty
Which have for long run by the hideous law
Under whose heavy sense your brothers life
Falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
And follows close the rigour of the statute
To make him an example All hope is gone
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo and thats my pith of business
Twixt you and your poor brother
Doth he so seek his life
Has censured him
Already and as I hear the provost hath
A warrant for his execution
Alas what poor abilitys in me
To do him good
Assay the power you have
My power Alas I doubt
Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo
And let him learn to know when maidens sue
Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them
Ill see what I can do
But speedily
I will about it straight
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair I humbly thank you
Commend me to my brother soon at night
Ill send him certain word of my success
I take my leave of you
Good sir adieu
Exeunt
Enter ANGELO ESCALUS and a Justice Provost Officers and other Attendants behind
We must not make a scarecrow of the law
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey
And let it keep one shape till custom make it

Ay but yet
Let us be keen and rather cut a little
Than fall and bruise to death Alas this gentleman
Whom I would save had a most noble father
Let but your honour know
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue
That in the working of your own affections
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing
Could have attaind the effect of your own purpose
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Errd in this point which now you censure him
And pulld the law upon you
Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus
Another thing to fall I not deny
The jury passing on the prisoners life
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try Whats open made to justice
That justice seizes what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves Tis very pregnant
The jewel that we find we stoop and taket
Because we see it but what we do not see
We tread upon and never think of it
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults but rather tell me
When I that censure him do so offend
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death
And nothing come in partial Sir he must die
Be it as your wisdom will
Where is the provost
Here if it like your honour
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine tomorrow morning
Bring him his confessor let him be prepared
For thats the utmost of his pilgrimage
Exit Provost
Aside  Well heaven forgive him and forgive us all
Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall
Some run from brakes of ice and answer none
And some condemned for a fault alone
Enter ELBOW and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY

Pardon is still the nurse of second woe
But yetpoor Claudio There is no remedy
Come sir
Exeunt
Enter Provost and a Servant
Hes hearing of a cause he will come straight
Ill tell him of you

Exit Servant

He hath but as offended in a dream
All sects all ages smack of this vice and he
To die fort
Enter ANGELO
Now whats the matter Provost
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow
Did not I tell thee yea hadst thou not order
Why dost thou ask again
Lest I might be too rash
Under your good correction I have seen
When after execution judgment hath
Repented oer his doom
Go to let that be mine
Do you your office or give up your place
And you shall well be spared
I crave your honours pardon
What shall be done sir with the groaning Juliet
Shes very near her hour
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place and that with speed
Reenter Servant
Here is the sister of the man condemnd
Desires access to you
Hath he a sister
Ay my good lord a very virtuous maid
And to be shortly of a sisterhood
If not already
Well let her be admitted
Exit Servant
See you the fornicatress be removed
Let have needful but not lavish means
There shall be order fort
Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO
God save your honour
Stay a little while
To ISABELLA
Youre welcome whats your will
I am a woeful suitor to your honour
Please but your honour hear me
Well whats your suit
There is a vice that most I do abhor
And most desire should meet the blow of justice
For which I would not plead but that I must
For which I must not plead but that I am
At war twixt will and will not
Well the matter
I have a brother is condemnd to die
I do beseech you let it be his fault
And not my brother
Aside  Heaven give thee moving graces
Why every faults condemnd ere it be done
Mine were the very cipher of a function
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record
O just but severe law
I had a brother then Heaven keep your honour
Aside to ISABELLA  Givet not oer so to him
again entreat him
Kneel down before him hang upon his gown
You are too cold if you should need a pin
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it
To him I say
Must he needs die
Maiden no remedy
Yes I do think that you might pardon him
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
I will not dot
But can you if you would
Look what I will not that I cannot do
But might you dot and do the world no wrong
If so your heart were touchd with that remorse
A s mine is to him
Hes sentenced tis too late
Aside to ISABELLA  You are too cold
Too late why no I that do speak a word
May call it back again Well believe this
No ceremony that to great ones longs
Not the kings crown nor the deputed sword
The marshals truncheon nor the judges robe
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does
If he had been as you and you as he
You would have slipt like him but he like you
Would not have been so stern
Pray you be gone
I would to heaven I had your potency
And you were Isabel should it then be thus
No I would tell what twere to be a judge
And what a prisoner
Aside to ISABELLA
Ay touch him theres the vein
Your brother is a forfeit of the law
And you but waste your words
Alas alas
Why all the souls that were were forfeit once
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy How would you be
If He which is the top of judgment should
But judge you as you are O think on that
And mercy then will breathe within your lips
Like man new made
Be you content fair maid
It is the law not I condemn your brother
Were he my kinsman brother or my son
It should be thus with him he must die tomorrow
Tomorrow O thats sudden Spare him spare him
Hes not prepared for death Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you
Who is it that hath died for this offence
Theres many have committed it
Aside to ISABELLA           Ay well said
The law hath not been dead though it hath slept
Those many had not dared to do that evil
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answerd for his deed now tis awake
Takes note of what is done and like a prophet
Looks in a glass that shows what future evils
Either new or by remissness newconceived
And so in progress to be hatchd and born
Are now to have no successive degrees
But ere they live to end
Yet show some pity
I show it most of all when I show justice
For then I pity those I do not know
Which a dismissd offence would after gall
And do him right that answering one foul wrong
Your brother dies tomorrow be content
So you must be the first that gives this sentence
And he that suffers O it is excellent
To have a giants strength but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant
Aside to ISABELLA   Thats well said
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does Jove would neer be quiet
For every pelting petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder
Nothing but thunder Merciful Heaven
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Splitst the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle but man proud man
Drest in a little brief authority
Most ignorant of what hes most assured
His glassy essence like an angry ape
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As make the angels weep who with our spleens
Would all themselves laugh mortal
Aside to ISABELLA  O to him to him wench he
will relent
Hes coming I perceive t
Aside  Pray heaven she win him
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself
Great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
But in the less foul profanation
Thourt i the right girl more o that
That in the captains but a choleric word
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
Aside to ISABELLA  Art avised o that more on t
Why do you put these sayings upon me
Because authority though it err like others
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
That skins the vice o the top Go to your bosom
Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
Thats like my brothers fault if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brothers life
Aside                  She speaks and tis
Such sense that my sense breeds with it Fare you well
Gentle my lord turn back
I will bethink me come again tomorrow
Hark how Ill bribe you good my lord turn back
How bribe me
Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
Aside to ISABELLA  You had marrd all else
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal
Well come to me tomorrow
Aside to ISABELLA  Go to tis well away
Heaven keep your honour safe
AsideAmen
For I am that way going to temptation
Where prayers cross
At what hour tomorrow
Shall I attend your lordship
At any time fore noon
Save your honour
Exeunt ISABELLA LUCIO and Provost
From thee even from thy virtue
Whats this whats this Is this her fault or mine
The tempter or the tempted who sins most
Ha
Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I
That lying by the violet in the sun
Do as the carrion does not as the flower
Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than womans lightness Having waste ground enough
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there O fie fie fie
What dost thou or what art thou Angelo
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good O let her brother live
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves What do I love her
That I desire to hear her speak again
And feast upon her eyes What ist I dream on
O cunning enemy that to catch a saint
With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet
With all her double vigour art and nature
Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite Even till now
When men were fond I smiled and wonderd how
Exit
Enter severally DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar and Provost
Hail to you provost so I think you are
I am the provost Whats your will good friar
Bound by my charity and my blest order
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes that I may minister
To them accordingly
I would do more than that if more were needful
Enter JULIET
Look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
Who falling in the flaws of her own youth
Hath blisterd her report she is with child
And he that got it sentenced a young man
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this
When must he die
As I do think tomorrow
I have provided for you stay awhile
To JULIET
And you shall be conducted
Repent you fair one of the sin you carry
I do and bear the shame most patiently
Ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
And try your penitence if it be sound
Or hollowly put on
Ill gladly learn
Love you the man that wrongd you
Yes as I love the woman that wrongd him
Was mutually committed
Mutually
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his
I do confess it and repent it father
Tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
But as we stand in fear
I do repent me as it is an evil
And take the shame with joy
There rest
Your partner as I hear must die tomorrow
And I am going with instruction to him
Grace go with you Benedicite
Exit
Must die tomorrow O injurious love
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror
Tis pity of him
Exeunt
Enter ANGELO
When I would pray and think I think and pray
To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words
Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
Anchors on Isabel Heaven in my mouth
As if I did but only chew his name
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception The state whereon I studied
Is like a good thing being often read
Grown feard and tedious yea my gravity
Whereinlet no man hear meI take pride
Could I with boot change for an idle plume
Which the air beats for vain O place O form
How often dost thou with thy case thy habit
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming Blood thou art blood
Lets write good angel on the devils horn
Tis not the devils crest
Enter a Servant
How now whos there
One Isabel a sister desires access to you
Teach her the way
Exit Servant
O heavens
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart
Making both it unable for itself
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
Come all to help him and so stop the air
By which he should revive and even so
The general subject to a wellwishd king
Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence
Enter ISABELLA
How now fair maid
I am come to know your pleasure
That you might know it would much better please me
Than to demand what tis Your brother cannot live
Even so Heaven keep your honour
Yet may he live awhile and it may be
As long as you or I yet he must die
Under your sentence
Yea
When I beseech you that in his reprieve
Longer or shorter he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not
Ha fie these filthy vices It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image
In stamps that are forbid tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one
Tis set down so in heaven but not in earth
Say you so then I shall pose you quickly
Which had you rather that the most just law
Now took your brothers life or to redeem him
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath staind
Sir believe this
I had rather give my body than my soul
I talk not of your soul our compelld sins
Stand more for number than for accompt
How say you
Nay Ill not warrant that for I can speak
Against the thing I say Answer to this
I now the voice of the recorded law
Pronounce a sentence on your brothers life
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brothers life
Please you to dot
Ill take it as a peril to my soul
It is no sin at all but charity
Pleased you to dot at peril of your soul
Were equal poise of sin and charity
That I do beg his life if it be sin
Heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
If that be sin Ill make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine
And nothing of your answer
Nay but hear me
Your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant
Or seem so craftily and thats not good
Let me be ignorant and in nothing good
But graciously to know I am no better
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could displayd But mark me
To be received plain Ill speak more gross
Your brother is to die
So
And his offence is so as it appears
Accountant to the law upon that pain
True
Admit no other way to save his life
As I subscribe not that nor any other
But in the loss of questionthat you his sister
Finding yourself desired of such a person
Whose credit with the judge or own great place
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the allbuilding law and that there were
No earthly mean to save him but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed or else to let him suffer
What would you do
As much for my poor brother as myself
That is were I under the terms of death
The impression of keen whips Ild wear as rubies
And strip myself to death as to a bed
That longing have been sick for ere Ild yield
My body up to shame
Then must your brother die
And twere the cheaper way
Better it were a brother died at once
Than that a sister by redeeming him
Should die for ever
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slanderd so
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption
You seemd of late to make the law a tyrant
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice
O pardon me my lord it oft falls out
To have what we would have we speak not what we mean
I something do excuse the thing I hate
For his advantage that I dearly love
We are all frail
Else let my brother die
If not a feodary but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness
Nay women are frail too
Ay as the glasses where they view themselves
Which are as easy broke as they make forms
Women Help Heaven men their creation mar
In profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail
For we are soft as our complexions are
And credulous to false prints
I think it well
And from this testimony of your own sex
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold
I do arrest your words Be that you are
That is a woman if you be more youre none
If you be one as you are well expressd
By all external warrants show it now
By putting on the destined livery
I have no tongue but one gentle my lord
Let me entreat you speak the former language
Plainly conceive I love you
My brother did love Juliet
And you tell me that he shall die for it
He shall not Isabel if you give me love
I know your virtue hath a licence int
Which seems a little fouler than it is
To pluck on others
Believe me on mine honour
My words express my purpose
Ha little honour to be much believed
And most pernicious purpose Seeming seeming
I will proclaim thee Angelo look fort
Sign me a present pardon for my brother
Or with an outstretchd throat Ill tell the world aloud
What man thou art
Who will believe thee Isabel
My unsoild name the austereness of my life
My vouch against you and my place i the state
Will so your accusation overweigh
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny I have begun
And now I give my sensual race the rein
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
That banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will
Or else he must not only die the death
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance Answer me tomorrow
Or by the affection that now guides me most
Ill prove a tyrant to him As for you
Say what you can my false oerweighs your true
Exit
To whom should I complain Did I tell this
Who would believe me O perilous mouths
That bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
Either of condemnation or approof
Bidding the law make courtsy to their will
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite
To follow as it draws Ill to my brother
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
That had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks held yield them up
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorrd pollution
Then Isabel live chaste and brother die
More than our brother is our chastity
Ill tell him yet of Angelos request
And fit his mind to death for his souls rest
Exit
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before CLAUDIO and Provost
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope
Ive hope to live and am prepared to die
Be absolute for death either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life
If I do lose thee I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep a breath thou art
Servile to all the skyey influences
That dost this habitation where thou keepst
Hourly afflict merely thou art deaths fool
For him thou labourst by thy flight to shun
And yet runnst toward him still Thou art not noble
For all the accommodations that thou bearst
Are nursed by baseness Thourt by no means valiant
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep
And that thou oft provokest yet grossly fearst
Thy death which is no more Thou art not thyself
For thou existst on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust Happy thou art not
For what thou hast not still thou strivest to get
And what thou hast forgetst Thou art not certain
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
After the moon If thou art rich thourt poor
For like an ass whose back with ingots bows
Thou bears thy heavy riches but a journey
And death unloads thee Friend hast thou none
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire
The mere effusion of thy proper loins
Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
For ending thee no sooner Thou hast nor youth nor age
But as it were an afterdinners sleep
Dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
Thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
To make thy riches pleasant Whats yet in this
That bears the name of life Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear
That makes these odds all even
I humbly thank you
To sue to live I find I seek to die
And seeking death find life let it come on
Within  What ho Peace here grace and good company
Whos there come in the wish deserves a welcome
Dear sir ere long Ill visit you again
Most holy sir I thank you
Enter ISABELLA
My business is a word or two with Claudio
And very welcome Look signior heres your sister
Provost a word with you
As many as you please
Bring me to hear them speak where I may be concealed
Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost
Now sister whats the comfort
Why
As all comforts are most good most good indeed
Lord Angelo having affairs to heaven
Intends you for his swift ambassador
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger
Therefore your best appointment make with speed
Tomorrow you set on
Is there no remedy
None but such remedy as to save a head
To cleave a heart in twain
But is there any
Yes brother you may live
There is a devilish mercy in the judge
If youll implore it that will free your life
But fetter you till death
Perpetual durance
Ay just perpetual durance a restraint
Though all the worlds vastidity you had
To a determined scope
But in what nature
In such a one as you consenting tot
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
And leave you naked
Let me know the point
O I do fear thee Claudio and I quake
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour Darest thou die
The sense of death is most in apprehension
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies
Why give you me this shame
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness If I must die
I will encounter darkness as a bride
And hug it in mine arms
There spake my brother there my fathers grave
Did utter forth a voice Yes thou must die
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances This outwardsainted deputy
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
His filth within being cast he would appear
A pond as deep as hell
The prenzie Angelo
O tis the cunning livery of hell
The damnedst body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards Dost thou think Claudio
If I would yield him my virginity
Thou mightst be freed
O heavens it cannot be
Yes he would givet thee from this rank offence
So to offend him still This nights the time
That I should do what I abhor to name
Or else thou diest tomorrow
Thou shalt not dot
O were it but my life
Ild throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin
Thanks dear Isabel
Be ready Claudio for your death tomorrow
Yes Has he affections in him
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose
When he would force it Sure it is no sin
Or of the deadly seven it is the least
Which is the least
If it were damnable he being so wise
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined O Isabel
What says my brother
Death is a fearful thing
And shamed life a hateful
Ay but to die and go we know not where
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
In thrilling region of thickribbed ice
To be imprisond in the viewless winds
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling tis too horrible
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age ache penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death
Alas alas
Sweet sister let me live
What sin you do to save a brothers life
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue
O you beast
O faithless coward O dishonest wretch
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
Ist not a kind of incest to take life
From thine own sisters shame What should I think
Heaven shield my mother playd my father fair
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Neer issued from his blood Take my defiance
Die perish Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
Ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death
No word to save thee
Nay hear me Isabel
O fie fie fie
Thy sins not accidental but a trade
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
Tis best thou diest quickly
O hear me Isabella
Reenter DUKE VINCENTIO
Vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
What is your will
Might you dispense with your leisure I would by and
would require is likewise your own benefit
I have no superfluous leisure my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs but I will attend you awhile
Walks apart
Son I have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her
of natures she having the truth of honour in her
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive I am confessor to Angelo and I
know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to
death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to
your knees and make ready
Let me ask my sister pardon I am so out of love
with life that I will sue to be rid of it
Hold you there farewell
Exit CLAUDIO
Provost a word with you
Reenter Provost
Whats your will father
That now you are come you will be gone Leave me
awhile with the maid my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company
In good time
Exit Provost ISABELLA comes forward
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness but grace being the soul of
your complexion shall keep the body of it ever
fair The assault that Angelo hath made to you
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but
that frailty hath examples for his falling I should
wonder at Angelo How will you do to content this
substitute and to save your brother
I am now going to resolve him I had rather my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born But O how much is the good duke
deceived in Angelo If ever he return and I can
speak to him I will open my lips in vain or
discover his government
That shall not be much amiss Yet as the matter
now stands he will avoid your accusation he made
trial of you only Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from
the angry law do no stain to your own gracious
person and much please the absent duke if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business
Let me hear you speak farther I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit
Virtue is bold and goodness never fearful Have
you not heard speak of Mariana the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea
I have heard of the lady and good words went with her name
She should this Angelo have married was affianced
to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between
solemnity her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and
renowned brother in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
her fortune her marriagedowry with both her
combinate husband this wellseeming Angelo
Can this be so did Angelo so leave her
Left her in her tears and dried not one of them
with his comfort swallowed his vows whole
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few
bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet
wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears
is washed with them but relents not
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world What corruption in this life that
it will let this man live But how out of this can she avail
It is a rupture that you may easily heal and the
cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it
Show me how good father
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection his unjust unkindness that
in all reason should have quenched her love hath
like an impediment in the current made it more
violent and unruly Go you to Angelo answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience agree with
his demands to the point only refer yourself to
this advantage first that your stay with him may
not be long that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it and the place answer to convenience
This being granted in courseand now follows
allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment go in your place if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to
her recompense and here by this is your brother
saved your honour untainted the poor Mariana
advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled The maid
will I frame and make fit for his attempt If you
think well to carry this as you may the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof
What think you of it
The image of it gives me content already and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection
It lies much in your holding up Haste you speedily
to Angelo if for this night he entreat you to his
presently to Saint Lukes there at the moated
grange resides this dejected Mariana At that
place call upon me and dispatch with Angelo that
it may be quickly
I thank you for this comfort Fare you well good father
Exeunt severally

Come your way sir Bless you good father friar
And you good brother father What offence hath

Fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd

What tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice say to thyself
From their abominable and beastly touches

Canst thou believe thy living is a life
So stinkingly depending Go mend go mend
Indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet
sir I would prove
Nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin
Thou wilt prove his Take him to prison officer
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit
He must before the deputy sir he has given him
warning the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster if
he be a whoremonger and comes before him he were

That we were all as some would seem to be

How doth my dear morsel thy mistress Procures she

Troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she

You will not bail me then sir
Then Pompey nor now What news abroad friar
what news
Come your ways sir come
Go to kennel Pompey go
Exeunt ELBOW POMPEY and Officers
What news friar of the duke
I know none Can you tell me of any
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia other
some he is in Rome but where is he think you
I know not where but wheresoever I wish him well
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state and usurp the beggary he was never born
to Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence he
puts transgression to t
He does well in t
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him something too crabbed that way friar
It is too general a vice and severity must cure it
Yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred
it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp
it quite friar till eating and drinking be put
down They say this Angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright way of creation is it
true think you
How should he be made then
Some report a seamaid spawned him some that he
was begot between two stockfishes But it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice that I know to be true and he is a
motion generative thats infallible
You are pleasant sir and speak apace
Why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man Would the duke that is absent have done this
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing
a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he
knew the service and that instructed him to mercy
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women he was not inclined that way
O sir you are deceived
Tis not possible
Who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and
his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish the
duke had crotchets in him He would be drunk too
that let me inform you
You do him wrong surely
Sir I was an inward of his A shy fellow was the
duke and I believe I know the cause of his
withdrawing
What I prithee might be the cause
No pardon tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips but this I can let you
understand the greater file of the subject held the
duke to be wise
Wise why no question but he was
A very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
Either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation Let him be but testimonied in his own
bringingsforth and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier
Therefore you speak unskilfully or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice
Sir I know him and I love him
Love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with
dearer love
Come sir I know what I know
I can hardly believe that since you know not what
you speak But if ever the duke return as our
prayers are he may let me desire you to make your
answer before him If it be honest you have spoke
you have courage to maintain it I am bound to call
upon you and I pray you your name
Sir my name is Lucio well known to the duke
He shall know you better sir if I may live to
report you
I fear you not
O you hope the duke will return no more or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite But indeed I
can do you little harm youll forswear this again
Ill be hanged first thou art deceived in me
friar But no more of this Canst thou tell if
Claudio die tomorrow or no
Why should he die sir
Why For filling a bottle with a tundish I would
the duke we talk of were returned again the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency sparrows must not build in his
houseeaves because they are lecherous The duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would
never bring them to light would he were returned
Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing
Farewell good friar I prithee pray for me The
duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on
Fridays Hes not past it yet and I say to thee
he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown
bread and garlic say that I said so Farewell
Exit
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure scape backwounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue
But who comes here
Enter ESCALUS Provost and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
Go away with her to prison
Good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted
a merciful man good my lord
Double and treble admonition and still forfeit in
the same kind This would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant
A bawd of eleven years continuance may it please
your honour
My lord this is one Lucios information against me
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
dukes time he promised her marriage his child
is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob
I have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me
That fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be
called before us Away with her to prison Go to
no more words
Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
Provost my brother Angelo will not be altered
Claudio must die tomorrow let him be furnished
with divines and have all charitable preparation
if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be
so with him
So please you this friar hath been with him and
advised him for the entertainment of death
Good even good father
Bliss and goodness on you
Of whence are you
Not of this country though my chance is now
To use it for my time I am a brother
Of gracious order late come from the See
In special business from his holiness
What news abroad i the world
None but that there is so great a fever on
goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it
novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure but
security enough to make fellowships accurst much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world This
news is old enough yet it is every days news I
pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
One that above all other strifes contended
especially to know himself
What pleasure was he given to
Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice a
gentleman of all temperance But leave we him to
his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation
He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice yet had he framed
to himself by the instruction of his frailty many
deceiving promises of life which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him and now is he
resolved to die
You have paid the heavens your function and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty but my brother justice have I
found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice
If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he
chance to fail he hath sentenced himself
I am going to visit the prisoner Fare you well
Peace be with you
Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe
Pattern in himself to know
Grace to stand and virtue go
More nor less to others paying
Than by selfoffences weighing
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking
Twice treble shame on Angelo
To weed my vice and let his grow
O what may man within him hide
Though angel on the outward side
How may likeness made in crimes
To draw with idle spiders strings
Most ponderous and substantial things
Craft against vice I must apply
With Angelo tonight shall lie
His old betrothed but despised
So disguise shall by the disguised
Exit
Enter MARIANA and a Boy
Boy sings
Take O take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn
And those eyes the break of day
Lights that do mislead the morn
But my kisses bring again bring again
Seals of love but sealed in vain sealed in vain
Break off thy song and haste thee quick away
Here comes a man of comfort whose advice
Hath often stilld my brawling discontent
Exit Boy
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
I cry you mercy sir and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical
Let me excuse me and believe me so
My mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe
Tis good though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good and good provoke to harm
I pray you tell me hath any body inquired
for me here today much upon this time have
I promised here to meet
You have not been inquired after
I have sat here all day
Enter ISABELLA
I do constantly believe you The time is come even
now I shall crave your forbearance a little may
be I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself
I am always bound to you
Exit
Very well met and well come
What is the news from this good deputy
He hath a garden circummured with brick
Whose western side is with a vineyard backd
And to that vineyard is a planched gate
That makes his opening with this bigger key
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him
But shall you on your knowledge find this way
I have taen a due and wary note upont
With whispering and most guilty diligence
The way twice oer
Are there no other tokens
Between you greed concerning her observance
No none but only a repair i the dark
And that I have possessd him my most stay
Can be but brief for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along
That stays upon me whose persuasion is
I come about my brother
Tis well borne up
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this What ho within come forth
Reenter MARIANA
I pray you be acquainted with this maid
She comes to do you good
I do desire the like
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you
Good friar I know you do and have found it
Take then this your companion by the hand
Who hath a story ready for your ear
I shall attend your leisure but make haste
The vaporous night approaches
Willt please you walk aside
Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA
O place and greatness millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies
Reenter MARIANA and ISABELLA
Welcome how agreed
Shell take the enterprise upon her father
If you advise it
It is not my consent
But my entreaty too
Little have you to say
When you depart from him but soft and low
Remember now my brother
Fear me not
Nor gentle daughter fear you not at all
To bring you thus together tis no sin
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit Come let us go
Our corns to reap for yet our tithes to sow
Exeunt
Enter Provost and POMPEY
Come hither sirrah Can you cut off a mans head
If the man be a bachelor sir I can but if he be a
married man hes his wifes head and I can never
cut off a womans head
Come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a
direct answer Tomorrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine Here is in our prison a common
executioner who in his office lacks a helper if
you will take it on you to assist him it shall
redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping for you have been a
notorious bawd
Sir I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner
What ho Abhorson Wheres Abhorson there
Enter ABHORSON
Do you call sir
Sirrah heres a fellow will help you tomorrow in
your execution If you think it meet compound with
him by the year and let him abide here with you if
not use him for the present and dismiss him He
cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd
A bawd sir fie upon him he will discredit our mystery
Go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn
the scale
Exit
Pray sir by your good favourfor surely sir a
good favour you have but that you have a hanging
lookdo you call sir your occupation a mystery
Ay sir a mystery
Painting sir I have heard say is a mystery and
your whores sir being members of my occupation
using painting do prove my occupation a mystery
but what mystery there should be in hanging if I
should be hanged I cannot imagine
Sir it is a mystery
Proof
Every true mans apparel fits your thief if it be
too little for your thief your true man thinks it
big enough if it be too big for your thief your
thief thinks it little enough so every true mans
apparel fits your thief
Reenter Provost
Are you agreed
Sir I will serve him for I do find your hangman is
a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth
oftener ask forgiveness
You sirrah provide your block and your axe
tomorrow four oclock
Come on bawd I will instruct thee in my trade follow
I do desire to learn sir and I hope if you have
occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find
me yare for truly sir for your kindness I owe you
a good turn
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio
Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON
The one has my pity not a jot the other
Being a murderer though he were my brother
Enter CLAUDIO
Look heres the warrant Claudio for thy death
Tis now dead midnight and by eight tomorrow
Thou must be made immortal Wheres Barnardine
As fast lockd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the travellers bones
He will not wake
Who can do good on him
Well go prepare yourself
Knocking within
But hark what noise
Heaven give your spirits comfort
Exit CLAUDIO
By and by
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
Welcome father
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
Envelope you good Provost Who calld here of late
None since the curfew rung
Not Isabel
No
They will then eret be long
What comfort is for Claudio
Theres some in hope
It is a bitter deputy
Not so not so his life is paralleld
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others were he meald with that
Which he corrects then were he tyrannous
But this being so hes just
Knocking within
Now are they come
Exit Provost
This is a gentle provost seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men
Knocking within
How now what noise That spirits possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes
Reenter Provost
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in he is calld up
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet
But he must die tomorrow
None sir none
As near the dawning provost as it is
You shall hear more ere morning
Happily
You something know yet I believe there comes
No countermand no such example have we
Besides upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Professd the contrary
Enter a Messenger
This is his lordships man
And here comes Claudios pardon
Giving a paper
My lord hath sent you this note and by me this
further charge that you swerve not from the
smallest article of it neither in time matter or
other circumstance Good morrow for as I take it
it is almost day
I shall obey him
Exit Messenger
Aside  This is his pardon purchased by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in
Hence hath offence his quick celerity
When it is born in high authority
When vice makes mercy mercys so extended
That for the faults love is the offender friended
Now sir what news
I told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss
in mine office awakens me with this unwonted
puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before
Pray you lets hear
Reads
Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let
Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the
let me have Claudios head sent me by five Let
this be duly performed with a thought that more
depends on it than we must yet deliver Thus fail
not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril
What say you to this sir
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon
A Bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one
that is a prisoner nine years old
How came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so
His friends still wrought reprieves for him and
Angelo came not to an undoubtful proof
It is now apparent
Most manifest and not denied by himself
Hath he born himself penitently in prison how
seems he to be touched
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless
of whats past present or to come insensible of
mortality and desperately mortal
He wants advice
He will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty
of the prison give him leave to escape hence he
would not drunk many times a day if not many days
entirely drunk We have very oft awaked him as if
to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming
warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
More of him anon There is written in your brow
provost honesty and constancy if I read it not
truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the
boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard
Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him To make you understand this in a
manifested effect I crave but four days respite
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy
Pray sir in what
In the delaying death
A lack how may I do it having the hour limited
and an express command under penalty to deliver
his head in the view of Angelo I may make my case
as Claudios to cross this in the smallest
By the vow of mine order I warrant you if my
instructions may be your guide Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed and his head born to Angelo
Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
O deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it
Shave the head and tie the beard and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death you know the course is common If any thing
fall to you upon this more than thanks and good
fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead
against it with my life
Pardon me good father it is against my oath
Were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
To him and to his substitutes
You will think you have made no offence if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing
But what likelihood is in that
Not a resemblance but a certainty Yet since I see
you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go
further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you
Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the
signet is not strange to you
I know them both
The contents of this is the return of the duke you
shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you
shall find within these two days he will be here
This is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor
perchance of the dukes death perchance entering
into some monastery but by chance nothing of what
is writ Look the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd Put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be all difficulties are but easy
when they are known Call your executioner and off
with Barnardines head I will give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place Yet you
are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you
Come away it is almost clear dawn
Exeunt

Reenter Provost
Now sir how do you find the prisoner
A creature unprepared unmeet for death
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable
Here in the prison father
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine a most notorious pirate
A man of Claudios years his beard and head
Just of his colour What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine more like to Claudio
O tis an accident that heaven provides
Dispatch it presently the hour draws on
Prefixd by Angelo see this be done
And sent according to command whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die
This shall be done good father presently
But Barnardine must die this afternoon
And how shall we continue Claudio
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive
Let this be done
Put them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudio
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation you shall find
Your safety manifested
I am your free dependant
Quick dispatch and send the head to Angelo
Exit Provost
Now will I write letters to Angelo
The provost he shall bear them whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home
And that by great injunctions I am bound
To enter publicly him Ill desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city and from thence
By cold gradation and wellbalanced form
We shall proceed with Angelo
Reenter Provost
Here is the head Ill carry it myself
Convenient is it Make a swift return
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours
Ill make all speed
Exit
Within  Peace ho be here
The tongue of Isabel Shes come to know
If yet her brothers pardon be come hither
But I will keep her ignorant of her good
To make her heavenly comforts of despair
When it is least expected
Enter ISABELLA
Ho by your leave
Good morning to you fair and gracious daughter
The better given me by so holy a man
Hath yet the deputy sent my brothers pardon
He hath released him Isabel from the world
His head is off and sent to Angelo
Nay but it is not so
It is no other show your wisdom daughter
In your close patience
O I will to him and pluck out his eyes
You shall not be admitted to his sight
Unhappy Claudio wretched Isabel
Injurious world most damned Angelo
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot
Forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven
Mark what I say which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity
The duke comes home tomorrow nay dry your eyes
One of our convent and his confessor
Gives me this instance already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates
There to give up their power If you can pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch
Grace of the duke revenges to your heart
And general honour
I am directed by you
This letter then to Friar Peter give
Tis that he sent me of the dukes return
Say by this token I desire his company
At Marianas house tonight Her cause and yours
Ill perfect him withal and he shall bring you
Before the duke and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home For my poor self
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent Wend you with this letter
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart trust not my holy order
If I pervert your course Whos here
Enter LUCIO
Good even Friar wheres the provost
Not within sir
O pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes so red thou must be patient I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for
my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set
me to t But they say the duke will be here
tomorrow By my troth Isabel I loved thy brother
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home he had lived
Exit ISABELLA
Sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports but the best is he lives not in them
Friar thou knowest not the duke so well as I do
hes a better woodman than thou takest him for
Well youll answer this one day Fare ye well
Nay tarry Ill go along with thee
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke
You have told me too many of him already sir if
they be true if not true none were enough
I was once before him for getting a wench with child
Did you such a thing
Yes marry did Ibut I was fain to forswear it
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar
Sir your company is fairer than honest Rest you well
By my troth Ill go with thee to the lanes end
if bawdy talk offend you well have very little of
it Nay friar I am a kind of burr I shall stick
Exeunt
Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other
show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted And why meet him at the gates and
redeliver our authorities there
I guess not
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering that if any crave redress of injustice
they should exhibit their petitions in the street
He shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of
complaints and to deliver us from devices
hereafter which shall then have no power to stand
against us
Well I beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes
i the morn Ill call you at your house give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him
I shall sir Fare you well
Good night
Exit ESCALUS
This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings A deflowerd maid
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss
How might she tongue me Yet reason dares her no
For my authority bears of a credent bulk
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather He should have lived
Save that riotous youth with dangerous sense
Might in the times to come have taen revenge
By so receiving a dishonourd life
With ransom of such shame Would yet he had lived
A lack when once our grace we have forgot
Nothing goes right we would and we would not
Exit
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit and FRIAR PETER
These letters at fit time deliver me
Giving letters
The provost knows our purpose and our plot
The matter being afoot keep your instruction
And hold you ever to our special drift
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
As cause doth minister Go call at Flavius house
And tell him where I stay give the like notice
To Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate
But send me Flavius first
It shall be speeded well
Exit
Enter VARRIUS
I thank thee Varrius thou hast made good haste
Come we will walk Theres other of our friends
Will greet us here anon my gentle Varrius
Exeunt
Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA
To speak so indirectly I am loath
I would say the truth but to accuse him so
That is your part yet I am advised to do it
He says to veil full purpose
Be ruled by him
Besides he tells me that if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side
I should not think it strange for tis a physic
Thats bitter to sweet end
I would Friar Peter
O peace the friar is come
Enter FRIAR PETER
Come I have found you out a stand most fit
Where you may have such vantage on the duke
He shall not pass you Twice have the trumpets sounded
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates and very near upon
The duke is entering therefore hence away
Exeunt
MARIANA veiled ISABELLA and FRIAR PETER at their  stand Enter DUKE VINCENTIO VARRIUS Lords  ANGELO ESCALUS LUCIO Provost Officers and Citizens at several doors
My very worthy cousin fairly met
Our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you
Happy return be to your royal grace
Many and hearty thankings to you both
We have made inquiry of you and we hear
Such goodness of your justice that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
Forerunning more requital
You make my bonds still greater
O your desert speaks loud and I should wrong it
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom
A forted residence gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion Give me your hand
And let the subject see to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within Come Escalus
You must walk by us on our other hand
And good supporters are you
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward
Now is your time speak loud and kneel before him
Justice O royal duke Vail your regard
Upon a wrongd I would fain have said a maid
O worthy prince dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice justice justice justice
Relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice
Reveal yourself to him
O worthy duke
You bid me seek redemption of the devil
Hear me yourself for that which I must speak
Must either punish me not being believed
Or wring redress from you Hear me O hear me here
My lord her wits I fear me are not firm
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice
By course of justice
And she will speak most bitterly and strange
Most strange but yet most truly will I speak
That Angelos forsworn is it not strange
That Angelos a murderer is t not strange
That Angelo is an adulterous thief
An hypocrite a virginviolator
Is it not strange and strange
Nay it is ten times strange
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange
Nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning
Away with her Poor soul
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense
O prince I conjure thee as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world
That thou neglect me not with that opinion
That I am touchd with madness Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike tis not impossible
But one the wickedst caitiff on the ground
May seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
As Angelo even so may Angelo
Be an archvillain believe it royal prince
If he be less hes nothing but hes more
Had I more name for badness
By mine honesty
If she be madas I believe no other
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
Such a dependency of thing on thing
As eer I heard in madness
O gracious duke
Harp not on that nor do not banish reason
For inequality but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid
And hide the false seems true
Many that are not mad
Have sure more lack of reason What would you say
I am the sister of one Claudio
To lose his head condemnd by Angelo
I in probation of a sisterhood
Was sent to by my brother one Lucio
As then the messenger
Thats I ant like your grace
I came to her from Claudio and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brothers pardon
Thats he indeed
You were not bid to speak
No my good lord
Nor wishd to hold my peace
I wish you now then
Pray you take note of it and when you have
A business for yourself pray heaven you then
Be perfect
I warrant your honour
The warrants for yourself take heed tot
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale
Right
It may be right but you are i the wrong
To speak before your time Proceed
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy
Thats somewhat madly spoken
Pardon it
The phrase is to the matter
Mended again The matter proceed
In brief to set the needless process by
How I persuaded how I prayd and kneeld
How he refelld me and how I replied
For this was of much lengththe vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter
He would not but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust
Release my brother and after much debatement
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
And I did yield to him but the next morn betimes
His purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
For my poor brothers head
This is most likely
O that it were as like as it is true
By heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speakst
Or else thou art subornd against his honour
Stands without blemish Next it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself if he had so offended
He would have weighd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off Some one hath set you on
Confess the truth and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain
And is this all
Then O you blessed ministers above
Keep me in patience and with ripend time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance Heaven shield your grace from woe
As I thus wrongd hence unbelieved go
I know yould fain be gone An officer
To prison with her Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither
One that I would were here Friar Lodowick
A ghostly father belike Who knows that Lodowick
My lord I know him tis a meddling friar
I do not like the man had he been lay my lord
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement I had swinged him soundly
Words against me this is a good friar belike
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute Let this friar be found
But yesternight my lord she and that friar
I saw them at the prison a saucy friar
A very scurvy fellow
Blessed be your royal grace
I have stood by my lord and I have heard
Your royal ear abused First hath this woman
Most wrongfully accused your substitute
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot
We did believe no less
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of
I know him for a man divine and holy
Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
As hes reported by this gentleman
And on my trust a man that never yet
Did as he vouches misreport your grace
My lord most villanously believe it
Well he in time may come to clear himself
But at this instant he is sick my lord
Of a strange fever Upon his mere request
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended gainst Lord Angelo came I hither
To speak as from his mouth what he doth know
Is true and false and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear
Whensoever hes convented First for this woman
To justify this worthy nobleman
So vulgarly and personally accused
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
Till she herself confess it
Good friar lets hear it
ISABELLA is carried off guarded and MARIANA comes forward
Do you not smile at this Lord Angelo
O heaven the vanity of wretched fools
Give us some seats Come cousin Angelo
In this Ill be impartial be you judge
Of your own cause Is this the witness friar
First let her show her face and after speak
Pardon my lord I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me
What are you married
No my lord
Are you a maid
No my lord
A widow then
Neither my lord
Why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife
My lord she may be a punk for many of them are
neither maid widow nor wife
Silence that fellow I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself
Well my lord
My lord I do confess I neer was married
And I confess besides I am no maid
I have known my husband yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me
He was drunk then my lord it can be no better
For the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
Well my lord
This is no witness for Lord Angelo
Now I come tot my lord
She that accuses him of fornication
In selfsame manner doth accuse my husband
And charges him my lord with such a time
When Ill depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love
Charges she more than me
Not that I know
No you say your husband
Why just my lord and that is Angelo
Who thinks he knows that he neer knew my body
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabels
This is a strange abuse Lets see thy face
My husband bids me now I will unmask
Unveiling
This is that face thou cruel Angelo
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on
Was fast belockd in thine this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel
And did supply thee at thy gardenhouse
In her imagined person
Know you this woman
Carnally she says
Sirrah no more
Enough my lord
My lord I must confess I know this woman
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her which was broke off
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity since which time of five years
I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
Upon my faith and honour
Noble prince
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
I am affianced this mans wife as strongly
As words could make up vows and my good lord
But Tuesday night last gone ins gardenhouse
He knew me as a wife As this is true
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or else for ever be confixed here
A marble monument
I did but smile till now
Now good my lord give me the scope of justice
My patience here is touchd I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on let me have way my lord
Ay with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure
Thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman
Though they would swear down each particular saint
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
Thats seald in approbation You Lord Escalus
Sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse whence tis derived
There is another friar that set them on
Let him be sent for
Would he were here my lord for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him
Go do it instantly
Exit Provost
And you my noble and wellwarranted cousin
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth
Do with your injuries as seems you best
In any chastisement I for a while will leave you
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers
My lord well do it throughly
Exit DUKE
Signior Lucio did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person
Cucullus non facit monachum honest in nothing
but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him we shall find this friar a
notable fellow
As any in Vienna on my word
Call that same Isabel here once again I would speak with her
Exit an Attendant
Pray you my lord give me leave to question you
shall see how Ill handle her
Not better than he by her own report
Say you
Marry sir I think if you handled her privately
she would sooner confess perchance publicly
shell be ashamed
I will go darkly to work with her
Thats the way for women are light at midnight
Reenter Officers with ISABELLA and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friars habit
Come on mistress heres a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said
My lord here comes the rascal I spoke of here with
the provost
In very good time speak not you to him till we
call upon you
Mum
Come sir did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo they have confessed you did
Tis false
How know you where you are
Respect to your great place and let the devil
Be sometime honourd for his burning throne
Where is the duke tis he should hear me speak
The dukes in us and we will hear you speak
Look you speak justly
Boldly at least But O poor souls
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox
Good night to your redress Is the duke gone
Then is your cause gone too The dukes unjust
Thus to retort your manifest appeal
And put your trial in the villains mouth
Which here you come to accuse
This is the rascal this is he I spoke of
Why thou unreverend and unhallowd friar
Ist not enough thou hast subornd these women
To accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear
To call him villain and then to glance from him
To the duke himself to tax him with injustice
Take him hence to the rack with him Well touse you
Joint by joint but we will know his purpose
What unjust
Be not so hot the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own his subject am I not
Nor here provincial My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it oerrun the stew laws for all faults
But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barbers shop
As much in mock as mark
Slander to the state Away with him to prison
What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio
Is this the man that you did tell us of
Tis he my lord Come hither goodman baldpate
do you know me
I remember you sir by the sound of your voice I
met you at the prison in the absence of the duke
O did you so And do you remember what you said of the duke
Most notedly sir
Do you so sir And was the duke a fleshmonger a
fool and a coward as you then reported him to be
You must sir change persons with me ere you make
that my report you indeed spoke so of him and
much more much worse
O thou damnable fellow Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches
I protest I love the duke as I love myself
Hark how the villain would close now after his
treasonable abuses
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal Away with
him to prison Where is the provost Away with him
to prison lay bolts enough upon him let him
speak no more Away with those giglots too and
with the other confederate companion
To Provost  Stay sir stay awhile
What resists he Help him Lucio
Come sir come sir come sir foh sir Why you
baldpated lying rascal you must be hooded must
you Show your knaves visage with a pox to you
show your sheepbiting face and be hanged an hour
Willt not off
Pulls off the friars hood and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO
Thou art the first knave that eer madest a duke
First provost let me bail these gentle three
To LUCIO
Sneak not away sir for the friar and you
Must have a word anon Lay hold on him
This may prove worse than hanging
To ESCALUS  What you have spoke I pardon sit you down
Well borrow place of him
To ANGELO
Sir by your leave
Hast thou or word or wit or impudence
That yet can do thee office If thou hast
Rely upon it till my tale be heard
And hold no longer out
O my dread lord
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness
To think I can be undiscernible
When I perceive your grace like power divine
Hath lookd upon my passes Then good prince
No longer session hold upon my shame
But let my trial be mine own confession
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg
Come hither Mariana
I was my lord
Go take her hence and marry her instantly
Do you the office friar which consummate
Return him here again Go with him provost
Exeunt ANGELO MARIANA FRIAR PETER and Provost
My lord I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it
Come hither Isabel
Your friar is now your prince as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business
Not changing heart with habit I am still
Attorneyd at your service
O give me pardon
That I your vassal have employd and paind
Your unknown sovereignty
You are pardond Isabel
And now dear maid be you as free to us
Your brothers death I know sits at your heart
And you may marvel why I obscured myself
Labouring to save his life and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost O most kind maid
It was the swift celerity of his death
Which I did think with slower foot came on
That braind my purpose But peace be with him
That life is better life past fearing death
Than that which lives to fear make it your comfort
So happy is your brother
I do my lord
Reenter ANGELO MARIANA FRIAR PETER and Provost
For this newmarried man approaching here
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrongd
Your well defended honour you must pardon
For Marianas sake but as he adjudged your brother
Being criminal in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promisebreach
Thereon dependent for your brothers life
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible even from his proper tongue
An Angelo for Claudio death for death
Haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
Like doth quit like and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE
Then Angelo thy faults thus manifested
Which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoopd to death and with like haste
Away with him
O my most gracious lord
I hope you will not mock me with a husband
It is your husband mockd you with a husband
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour
I thought your marriage fit else imputation
For that he knew you might reproach your life
And choke your good to come for his possessions
Although by confiscation they are ours
We do instate and widow you withal
To buy you a better husband
O my dear lord
I crave no other nor no better man
Never crave him we are definitive
Gentle my liege
Kneeling
You do but lose your labour
Away with him to death
To LUCIO
Now sir to you
O my good lord Sweet Isabel take my part
Lend me your knees and all my life to come
Ill lend you all my life to do you service
Against all sense you do importune her
Her brothers ghost his paved bed would break
And take her hence in horror
Isabel
Sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me
Hold up your hands say nothing Ill speak all
They say best men are moulded out of faults
And for the most become much more the better
For being a little bad so may my husband
O Isabel will you not lend a knee
He dies for Claudios death
Most bounteous sir
Kneeling
Look if it please you on this man condemnd
As if my brother lived I partly think
A due sincerity governd his deeds
Till he did look on me since it is so
Let him not die My brother had but justice
In that he did the thing for which he died
For Angelo
And must be buried but as an intent
That perishd by the way thoughts are no subjects
Intents but merely thoughts
Merely my lord
Your suits unprofitable stand up I say
I have bethought me of another fault
Provost how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour
It was commanded so
Had you a special warrant for the deed
No my good lord it was by private message
For which I do discharge you of your office
Give up your keys
Pardon me noble lord
I thought it was a fault but knew it not
Yet did repent me after more advice
For testimony whereof one in the prison
That should by private order else have died
I have reserved alive
Whats he
His name is Barnardine
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio
Go fetch him hither let me look upon him
Exit Provost
I am sorry one so learned and so wise
As you Lord Angelo have still appeard
Should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
And lack of temperd judgment afterward
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy
Tis my deserving and I do entreat it
Reenter Provost with BARNARDINE CLAUDIO muffled and JULIET
Which is that Barnardine
This my lord
There was a friar told me of this man
Sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
That apprehends no further than this world
And squarest thy life according Thourt condemnd
But for those earthly faults I quit them all
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come Friar advise him
I leave him to your hand What muffled fellows that
This is another prisoner that I saved
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head
As like almost to Claudio as himself
Unmuffles CLAUDIO
To ISABELLA  If he be like your brother for his sake
Is he pardond and for your lovely sake
Give me your hand and say you will be mine
He is my brother too but fitter time for that
By this Lord Angelo perceives hes safe
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye
Well Angelo your evil quits you well
Look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
I find an apt remission in myself
And yet heres one in place I cannot pardon
To LUCIO
You sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward
One all of luxury an ass a madman
Wherein have I so deserved of you
That you extol me thus
Faith my lord I spoke it but according to the
trick If you will hang me for it you may but I
had rather it would please you I might be whipt
Whipt first sir and hanged after
Proclaim it provost round about the city
Is any woman wrongd by this lewd fellow
As I have heard him swear himself theres one
Whom he begot with child let her appear
And he shall marry her the nuptial finishd
Let him be whipt and hangd
I beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore
Your highness said even now I made you a duke
good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold
Upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits Take him to prison
And see our pleasure herein executed
Marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death
whipping and hanging
Slandering a prince deserves it
Exit Officers with LUCIO
She Claudio that you wrongd look you restore
Joy to you Mariana Love her Angelo
I have confessd her and I know her virtue
Thanks good friend Escalus for thy much goodness
Theres more behind that is more gratulate
Thanks provost for thy care and secrecy
We shill employ thee in a worthier place
Forgive him Angelo that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudios
The offence pardons itself Dear Isabel
I have a motion much imports your good
Whereto if youll a willing ear incline
Whats mine is yours and what is yours is mine
So bring us to our palace where well show
Whats yet behind thats meet you all should know
Exeunt
Enter ANTONIO SALARINO and SALANIO
In sooth I know not why I am so sad
It wearies me you say it wearies you
But how I caught it found it or came by it
What stuff tis made of whereof it is born
I am to learn
And such a wantwit sadness makes of me
That I have much ado to know myself
Your mind is tossing on the ocean
There where your argosies with portly sail
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
Or as it were the pageants of the sea
Do overpeer the petty traffickers
That curtsy to them do them reverence
As they fly by them with their woven wings
Believe me sir had I such venture forth
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad I should be still
Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
Would make me sad
My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague when I thought
What harm a wind too great at sea might do
I should not see the sandy hourglass run
But I should think of shallows and of flats
And see my wealthy Andrew dockd in sand
Vailing her hightop lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
Which touching but my gentle vessels side
Would scatter all her spices on the stream
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
And in a word but even now worth this
And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought
To think on this and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad
But tell not me I know Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise
Believe me no I thank my fortune for it
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted
Nor to one place nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
Why then you are in love
Fie fie
Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad
Because you are not merry and twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
Because you are not sad Now by twoheaded Janus
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper
And other of such vinegar aspect
That theyll not show their teeth in way of smile
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable
Enter BASSANIO LORENZO and GRATIANO
Here comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman
Gratiano and Lorenzo Fare ye well
We leave you now with better company
I would have stayd till I had made you merry
If worthier friends had not prevented me
Your worth is very dear in my regard
I take it your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart
Good morrow my good lords
Good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
You grow exceeding strange must it be so
Well make our leisures to attend on yours
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio
My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio
We two will leave you but at dinnertime
I pray you have in mind where we must meet
I will not fail you
You look not well Signior Antonio
You have too much respect upon the world
They lose it that do buy it with much care
Believe me you are marvellously changed
I hold the world but as the world Gratiano
A stage where every man must play a part
And mine a sad one
Let me play the fool
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans
Why should a man whose blood is warm within
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish I tell thee what Antonio
I love thee and it is my love that speaks
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond
And do a wilful stillness entertain
With purpose to be dressd in an opinion
Of wisdom gravity profound conceit
As who should say I am Sir Oracle
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark
O my Antonio I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing when I am very sure
If they should speak would almost damn those ears
Which hearing them would call their brothers fools
Ill tell thee more of this another time
But fish not with this melancholy bait
For this fool gudgeon this opinion
Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well awhile
Ill end my exhortation after dinner
Well we will leave you then till dinnertime
I must be one of these same dumb wise men
For Gratiano never lets me speak
Well keep me company but two years moe
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
Farewell Ill grow a talker for this gear
Thanks i faith for silence is only commendable
In a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO
Is that any thing now
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more
than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you
shall seek all day ere you find them and when you
have them they are not worth the search
Well tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
That you today promised to tell me of
Tis not unknown to you Antonio
How much I have disabled mine estate
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged To you Antonio
I owe the most in money and in love
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe
I pray you good Bassanio let me know it
And if it stand as you yourself still do
Within the eye of honour be assured
My purse my person my extremest means
Lie all unlockd to your occasions
In my schooldays when I had lost one shaft
I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight
The selfsame way with more advised watch
To find the other forth and by adventuring both
I oft found both I urge this childhood proof
Because what follows is pure innocence
I owe you much and like a wilful youth
That which I owe is lost but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt
As I will watch the aim or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first
You know me well and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done
And I am prest unto it therefore speak
In Belmont is a lady richly left
And she is fair and fairer than that word
Of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages
Her name is Portia nothing undervalued
To Catos daughter Brutus Portia
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos strand
And many Jasons come in quest of her
O my Antonio had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them
I have a mind presages me such thrift
That I should questionless be fortunate
Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum therefore go forth
Try what my credit can in Venice do
That shall be rackd even to the uttermost
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia
Go presently inquire and so will I
Where money is and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake
Exeunt
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of
this great world
You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are and
yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing It
is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the
mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but
competency lives longer
Good sentences and well pronounced
They would be better if well followed
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do chapels had been churches and poor mens
cottages princes palaces It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may
devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the
youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the
cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband O me the word choose I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father Is it not hard
Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse none
Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their
death have good inspirations therefore the lottery
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold
silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come
I pray thee overname them and as thou namest
them I will describe them and according to my
description level at my affection
First there is the Neapolitan prince
Ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts that he can
shoe him himself I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith
Then there is the County Palatine
He doth nothing but frown as who should say If you
will not have me choose he hears merry tales and
smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be
married to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these God defend me from these
two
How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man
In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but
he why he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than
the Count Palatine he is every man in no man if a
throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will
fence with his own shadow if I should marry him I
should marry twenty husbands If he would despise me
I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I
shall never requite him
What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron
of England
You know I say nothing to him for he understands
not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French
nor Italian and you will come into the court and
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English
He is a proper mans picture but alas who can
converse with a dumbshow How oddly he is suited
I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round
hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his
behavior every where
What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another
How like you the young German the Duke of Saxonys nephew
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and
most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when
he is best he is a little worse than a man and
when he is worst he is little better than a beast
and the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall
make shift to go without him
If he should offer to choose and choose the right
casket you should refuse to perform your fathers
will if you should refuse to accept him
Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without I know he will choose it I will do any
thing Nerissa ere Ill be married to a sponge
You need not fear lady the having any of these
lords they have acquainted me with their
determinations which is indeed to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit unless
you may be won by some other sort than your fathers
imposition depending on the caskets
If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as
chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner
of my fathers will I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable for there is not one among them
but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant
them a fair departure
Do you not remember lady in your fathers time a
Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat
Yes yes it was Bassanio as I think he was so called
True madam he of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
I remember him well and I remember him worthy of
thy praise
Enter a Servingman
How now what news
The four strangers seek for you madam to take
their leave and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the
prince his master will be here tonight
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should
be glad of his approach if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had
rather he should shrive me than wive me Come
Nerissa Sirrah go before
Whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer another knocks at the door
Exeunt
Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK
Three thousand ducats well
Ay sir for three months
For three months well
For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound
Antonio shall become bound well
May you stead me will you pleasure me shall I
know your answer
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound
Your answer to that
Antonio is a good man
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary
Oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient Yet his means are in supposition he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the
Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he
hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and
other ventures he hath squandered abroad But ships
are but boards sailors but men there be landrats
and waterrats waterthieves and landthieves I
mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters
winds and rocks The man is notwithstanding
sufficient Three thousand ducats I think I may
take his bond
Be assured you may
I will be assured I may and that I may be assured
I will bethink me May I speak with Antonio
If it please you to dine with us
Yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I
will buy with you sell with you talk with you
walk with you and so following but I will not eat
with you drink with you nor pray with you What
news on the Rialto Who is he comes here
Enter ANTONIO
This is Signior Antonio
Aside  How like a fawning publican he looks
I hate him for he is a Christian
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice
If I can catch him once upon the hip
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him
He hates our sacred nation and he rails
Even there where merchants most do congregate
On me my bargains and my wellwon thrift
Which he calls interest Cursed be my tribe
If I forgive him
Shylock do you hear
I am debating of my present store
And by the near guess of my memory
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats What of that
Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe
Will furnish me But soft how many months
Do you desire
To ANTONIO
Rest you fair good signior
Your worship was the last man in our mouths
Shylock although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess
Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
Ill break a custom Is he yet possessd
How much ye would
Ay ay three thousand ducats
And for three months
I had forgot three months you told me so
Well then your bond and let me see but hear you
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage
I do never use it
When Jacob grazed his uncle Labans sheep
This Jacob from our holy Abram was
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf
The third possessor ay he was the third
And what of him did he take interest
No not take interest not as you would say
Directly interest mark what Jacob did
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streakd and pied
Should fall as Jacobs hire the ewes being rank
In the end of autumn turned to the rams
And when the work of generation was
The skilful shepherd peeld me certain wands
And in the doing of the deed of kind
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall particolourd lambs and those were Jacobs
This was a way to thrive and he was blest
And thrift is blessing if men steal it not
This was a venture sir that Jacob served for
A thing not in his power to bring to pass
But swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven
Was this inserted to make interest good
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
I cannot tell I make it breed as fast
But note me signior
Mark you this Bassanio
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek
A goodly apple rotten at the heart
O what a goodly outside falsehood hath
Three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
Three months from twelve then let me see the rate
Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you
Signior Antonio many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe
You call me misbeliever cutthroat dog
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine
And all for use of that which is mine own
Well then it now appears you need my help
Go to then you come to me and you say
Shylock we would have moneys you say so
You that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold moneys is your suit
What should I say to you Should I not say
Hath a dog money is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondmans key
With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this
Fair sir you spit on me on Wednesday last
You spurnd me such a day another time
You calld me dog and for these courtesies
Ill lend you thus much moneys
I am as like to call thee so again
To spit on thee again to spurn thee too
If thou wilt lend this money lend it not
As to thy friends for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend
But lend it rather to thine enemy
Who if he break thou mayst with better face
Why look you how you storm
I would be friends with you and have your love
Forget the shames that you have staind me with
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys and youll not hear me
This is kind I offer
This were kindness
This kindness will I show
Go with me to a notary seal me there
Your single bond and in a merry sport
If you repay me not on such a day
In such a place such sum or sums as are
Expressd in the condition let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me
Content i faith Ill seal to such a bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew
You shall not seal to such a bond for me
Ill rather dwell in my necessity
Why fear not man I will not forfeit it
Within these two months thats a month before
This bond expires I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond
O father Abram what these Christians are
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others Pray you tell me this
If he should break his day what should I gain
A pound of mans flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable profitable neither
As flesh of muttons beefs or goats I say
To buy his favour I extend this friendship
If he will take it so if not adieu
And for my love I pray you wrong me not
Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond
Then meet me forthwith at the notarys
Give him direction for this merry bond
And I will go and purse the ducats straight
See to my house left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave and presently
I will be with you
Hie thee gentle Jew
Exit Shylock
The Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind
I like not fair terms and a villains mind
Come on in this there can be no dismay
My ships come home a month before the day
Exeunt
Flourish of cornets Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO  and his train PORTIA NERISSA and others attending
Mislike me not for my complexion
The shadowd livery of the burnishd sun
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred
Bring me the fairest creature northward born
Where Phoebus fire scarce thaws the icicles
And let us make incision for your love
To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
I tell thee lady this aspect of mine
Hath feard the valiant by my love I swear
The bestregarded virgins of our clime
Have loved it too I would not change this hue
Except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maidens eyes
Besides the lottery of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged me by his wit to yield myself
His wife who wins me by that means I told you
Yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
As any comer I have lookd on yet
For my affection
Even for that I thank you
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets
To try my fortune By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear
Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey
To win thee lady But alas the while
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man the greater throw
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand
So is Alcides beaten by his page
And so may I blind fortune leading me
Miss that which one unworthier may attain
And die with grieving
You must take your chance
And either not attempt to choose at all
Or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage therefore be advised
Nor will not Come bring me unto my chance
First forward to the temple after dinner
Your hazard shall be made
Good fortune then
To make me blest or cursedst among men
Cornets and exeunt
Enter LAUNCELOT
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from

friendly counsel I will run fiend my heels are

Enter Old GOBBO with a basket
Master young man you I pray you which is the way

Her name is Margery indeed Ill be sworn if thou

Lord worshipped might he be what a beard hast thou

To him father
God bless your worship
Gramercy wouldst thou aught with me
Heres my son sir a poor boy
Not a poor boy sir but the rich Jews man that
would sir as my father shall specify
He hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve
Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew
and have a desire as my father shall specify
His master and he saving your worships reverence
are scarce catercousins
To be brief the very truth is that the Jew having
done me wrong doth cause me as my father being I
hope an old man shall frutify unto you
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
your worship and my suit is
In very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as
your worship shall know by this honest old man and
though I say it though old man yet poor man my father
One speak for both What would you
Serve you sir
That is the very defect of the matter sir
I know thee well thou hast obtaind thy suit
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day
And hath preferrd thee if it be preferment
To leave a rich Jews service to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman
The old proverb is very well parted between my
master Shylock and you sir you have the grace of
God sir and he hath enough
Thou speakst it well Go father with thy son
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
My lodging out Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows see it done
Father in I cannot get a service no I have
neer a tongue in my head Well if any man in
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
upon a book I shall have good fortune Go to
heres a simple line of life heres a small trifle
of wives alas fifteen wives is nothing eleven
widows and nine maids is a simple comingin for one
man and then to scape drowning thrice and to be
in peril of my life with the edge of a featherbed

woman shes a good wench for this gear Father
come Ill take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye

Signior Bassanio
Gratiano
I have a suit to you
You have obtaind it
You must not deny me I must go with you to Belmont
Why then you must But hear thee Gratiano
Thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults
But where thou art not known why there they show
Something too liberal Pray thee take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior
I be misconstrued in the place I go to
And lose my hopes
Signior Bassanio hear me
If I do not put on a sober habit
Talk with respect and swear but now and then
Wear prayerbooks in my pocket look demurely
Nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes
Thus with my hat and sigh and say amen
Use all the observance of civility
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
To please his grandam never trust me more
Well we shall see your bearing
Nay but I bar tonight you shall not gauge me
By what we do tonight
No that were pity
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends
That purpose merriment But fare you well
I have some business
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest
But we will visit you at suppertime
Exeunt

And Launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see
Lorenzo who is thy new masters guest
Give him this letter do it secretly
And so farewell I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee
Adieu tears exhibit my tongue Most beautiful
pagan most sweet Jew if a Christian did not play
the knave and get thee I am much deceived But
adieu these foolish drops do something drown my
manly spirit adieu
Farewell good Launcelot
Exit Launcelot
Alack what heinous sin is it in me
To be ashamed to be my fathers child
But though I am a daughter to his blood
I am not to his manners O Lorenzo
If thou keep promise I shall end this strife
Become a Christian and thy loving wife
Exit
Enter GRATIANO LORENZO SALARINO and SALANIO
Nay we will slink away in suppertime
Disguise us at my lodging and return

And better in my mind not undertook
Tis now but four oclock we have two hours
To furnish us
Enter LAUNCELOT with a letter
Friend Launcelot whats the news

Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian
Hold here take this tell gentle Jessica

Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO
Was not that letter from fair Jessica

How I shall take her from her fathers house
What gold and jewels she is furnishd with
What pages suit she hath in readiness
If eer the Jew her father come to heaven
It will be for his gentle daughters sake
And never dare misfortune cross her foot
Unless she do it under this excuse
That she is issue to a faithless Jew
Come go with me peruse this as thou goest
Fair Jessica shall be my torchbeare r
Exeunt
Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT
Well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio
What Jessicathou shalt not gormandise
As thou hast done with meWhat Jessica
And sleep and snore and rend apparel out
Why Jessica I say
Why Jessica
Who bids thee call I do not bid thee call
Your worship was wont to tell me that
I could do nothing without bidding
Enter Jessica
Call you what is your will
I am bid forth to supper Jessica
There are my keys But wherefore should I go
I am not bid for love they flatter me
But yet Ill go in hate to feed upon
The prodigal Christian Jessica my girl
Look to my house I am right loath to go
There is some ill abrewing towards my rest
For I did dream of moneybags tonight
I beseech you sir go my young master doth expect
your reproach
So do I his
An they have conspired together I will not say you
shall see a masque but if you do then it was not
for nothing that my nose fell ableeding on
BlackMonday last at six oclock i the morning
falling out that year on AshWednesday was four
year in the afternoon
What are there masques Hear you me Jessica
Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum
And the vile squealing of the wryneckd fife
Clamber not you up to the casements then
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnishd faces
But stop my houses ears I mean my casements
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
My sober house By Jacobs staff I swear
I have no mind of feasting forth tonight
But I will go Go you before me sirrah
Say I will come
I will go before sir Mistress look out at
window for all this There will come a Christian
boy will be worth a Jewess eye
Exit
What says that fool of Hagars offspring ha
His words were Farewell mistress nothing else
The patch is kind enough but a huge feeder
Snailslow in profit and he sleeps by day
More than the wildcat drones hive not with me
Therefore I part with him and part with him
To one that would have him help to waste
His borrowd purse Well Jessica go in
Perhaps I will return immediately
Do as I bid you shut doors after you
Fast bind fast find
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind
Exit
Farewell and if my fortune be not crost
I have a father you a daughter lost
Exit
Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO masqued
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand
His hour is almost past
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour
For lovers ever run before the clock
O ten times faster Venus pigeons fly
To seal loves bonds newmade than they are wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited
That ever holds who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first All things that are
Are with more spirit chased than enjoyd
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay
Huggd and embraced by the strumpet wind
How like the prodigal doth she return
With overweatherd ribs and ragged sails
Lean rent and beggard by the strumpet wind
Here comes Lorenzo more of this hereafter
Enter LORENZO
Sweet friends your patience for my long abode
Not I but my affairs have made you wait
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives
Ill watch as long for you then Approach
Here dwells my father Jew Ho whos within
Enter JESSICA above in boys clothes
Who are you Tell me for more certainty
Albeit Ill swear that I do know your tongue
Lorenzo and thy love
Lorenzo certain and my love indeed
For who love I so much And now who knows
But you Lorenzo whether I am yours
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
Here catch this casket it is worth the pains
I am glad tis night you do not look on me
For I am much ashamed of my exchange
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit
For if they could Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy
Descend for you must be my torchbearer
What must I hold a candle to my shames
They in themselves goodsooth are too too light
Why tis an office of discovery love
And I should be obscured
So are you sweet
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy
But come at once
For the close night doth play the runaway
And we are stayd for at Bassanios feast
I will make fast the doors and gild myself
With some more ducats and be with you straight
Exit above
Now by my hood a Gentile and no Jew
Beshrew me but I love her heartily
For she is wise if I can judge of her
And fair she is if that mine eyes be true
And true she is as she hath proved herself
And therefore like herself wise fair and true
Shall she be placed in my constant soul
Enter JESSICA below
What art thou come On gentlemen away
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay
Exit with Jessica and Salarino
Enter ANTONIO
Whos there
Signior Antonio
Fie fie Gratiano where are all the rest
Tis nine oclock our friends all stay for you
No masque tonight the wind is come about
Bassanio presently will go aboard
I have sent twenty out to seek for you
I am glad ont I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone tonight
Exeunt
Flourish of cornets Enter PORTIA with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and their trains
Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince
Now make your choice
The first of gold who this inscription bears
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
The second silver which this promise carries
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
This third dull lead with warning all as blunt
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
How shall I know if I do choose the right
The one of them contains my picture prince
If you choose that then I am yours withal
Some god direct my judgment Let me see
I will survey the inscriptions back again
What says this leaden casket
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
Must give for what for lead hazard for lead
This casket threatens Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
Ill then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
What says the silver with her virgin hue
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
As much as he deserves Pause there Morocco
And weigh thy value with an even hand
If thou best rated by thy estimation
Thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
May not extend so far as to the lady
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself
As much as I deserve Why thats the lady
I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
In graces and in qualities of breeding
But more than these in love I do deserve
What if I strayd no further but chose here
Lets see once more this saying graved in gold
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
Why thats the lady all the world desires her
From the four corners of the earth they come
To kiss this shrine this mortalbreathing saint
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia
The watery kingdom whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits but they come
As oer a brook to see fair Portia
One of these three contains her heavenly picture
Ist like that lead contains her Twere damnation
To think so base a thought it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
Or shall I think in silver shes immured
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold
O sinful thought Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Stamped in gold but thats insculpd upon
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within Deliver me the key
Here do I choose and thrive I as I may
There take it prince and if my form lie there
Then I am yours
He unlocks the golden casket
O hell what have we here
A carrion Death within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll Ill read the writing
Reads
All that glitters is not gold
Often have you heard that told
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold
Gilded tombs do worms enfold
Had you been as wise as bold
Young in limbs in judgment old
Your answer had not been inscrolld
Fare you well your suit is cold
Cold indeed and labour lost
Then farewell heat and welcome frost
Portia adieu I have too grieved a heart
To take a tedious leave thus losers part
Exit with his train Flourish of cornets
A gentle riddance Draw the curtains go
Let all of his complexion choose me so
Exeunt
Enter SALARINO and SALANIO
Why man I saw Bassanio under sail
With him is Gratiano gone along
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke
Who went with him to search Bassanios ship
He came too late the ship was under sail
But there the duke was given to understand
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica
Besides Antonio certified the duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship
I never heard a passion so confused
So strange outrageous and so variable
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets
My daughter O my ducats O my daughter
Fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats
Justice the law my ducats and my daughter
A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
Of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter
And jewels two stones two rich and precious stones
Stolen by my daughter Justice find the girl
She hath the stones upon her and the ducats
Why all the boys in Venice follow him
Crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
Let good Antonio look he keep his day
Or he shall pay for this
Marry well rememberd
I reasond with a Frenchman yesterday
Who told me in the narrow seas that part
The French and English there miscarried
A vessel of our country richly fraught
I thought upon Antonio when he told me
And wishd in silence that it were not his
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear
Yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Of his return he answerd Do not so
Slubber not business for my sake Bassanio
But stay the very riping of the time
And for the Jews bond which he hath of me
Let it not enter in your mind of love
Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
As shall conveniently become you there
And even there his eye being big with tears
Turning his face he put his hand behind him
And with affection wondrous sensible
He wrung Bassanios hand and so they parted
I think he only loves the world for him
I pray thee let us go and find him out
And quicken his embraced heaviness
With some delight or other
Do we so
Exeunt
Enter NERISSA with a Servitor
Quick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straight
The Prince of Arragon hath taen his oath
And comes to his election presently
Flourish of cornets Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON PORTIA and their trains
Behold there stand the caskets noble prince
If you choose that wherein I am containd
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized
But if you fail without more speech my lord
You must be gone from hence immediately
I am enjoind by oath to observe three things
First never to unfold to any one
Which casket twas I chose next if I fail
Of the right casket never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage Lastly
If I do fail in fortune of my choice
Immediately to leave you and be gone
To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self
And so have I addressd me Fortune now
To my hearts hope Gold silver and base lead
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard
What says the golden chest ha let me see
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
What many men desire that many may be meant
By the fool multitude that choose by show
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
Which pries not to the interior but like the martlet
Builds in the weather on the outward wall
Even in the force and road of casualty
I will not choose what many men desire
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes
Why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
And well said too for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity
O that estates degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly and that clear honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer
How many then should cover that stand bare
How many be commanded that command
How much low peasantry would then be gleand
From the true seed of honour and how much honour
Pickd from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be newvarnishd Well but to my choice
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
I will assume desert Give me a key for this
And instantly unlock my fortunes here
He opens the silver casket
Too long a pause for that which you find there
Whats here the portrait of a blinking idiot
Presenting me a schedule I will read it
How much unlike art thou to Portia
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings
Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves
Did I deserve no more than a fools head
Is that my prize are my deserts no better
To offend and judge are distinct offices
And of opposed natures
What is here
Reads
The fire seven times tried this
Seven times tried that judgment is
That did never choose amiss
Some there be that shadows kiss
Such have but a shadows bliss
There be fools alive I wis
Silverd oer and so was this
Take what wife you will to bed
I will ever be your head
So be gone you are sped
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
With one fools head I came to woo
But I go away with two
Sweet adieu Ill keep my oath
Patiently to bear my wroth
Exeunt Arragon and train
Thus hath the candle singed the moth
O these deliberate fools when they do choose
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose
The ancient saying is no heresy
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny
Come draw the curtain Nerissa
Enter a Servant
Where is my lady
Here what would my lord
Madam there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian one that comes before
To signify the approaching of his lord
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets
To wit besides commends and courteous breath
Gifts of rich value Yet I have not seen
So likely an ambassador of love
A day in April never came so sweet
To show how costly summer was at hand
As this forespurrer comes before his lord
No more I pray thee I am half afeard
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee
Thou spendst such highday wit in praising him
Come come Nerissa for I long to see
Quick Cupids post that comes so mannerly
Bassanio lord Love if thy will it be
Exeunt
Enter SALANIO and SALARINO
Now what news on the Rialto
Why yet it lives there uncheckd that Antonio hath
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas
the Goodwins I think they call the place a very
dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many
a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip
Report be an honest woman of her word
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
wept for the death of a third husband But it is
true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the
honest AntonioO that I had a title good enough
to keep his name company
Come the full stop
Ha what sayest thou Why the end is he hath
lost a ship
I would it might prove the end of his losses
Let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my
prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew
Enter SHYLOCK
How now Shylock what news among the merchants
You know none so well none so well as you of my
daughters flight
Thats certain I for my part knew the tailor
that made the wings she flew withal
And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was
fledged and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam
She is damned for it
Thats certain if the devil may be her judge
My own flesh and blood to rebel
Out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
than between jet and ivory more between your bloods
than there is between red wine and rhenish But
tell us do you hear whether Antonio have had any
loss at sea or no
There I have another bad match a bankrupt a
prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the
Rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon
the mart let him look to his bond he was wont to
call me usurer let him look to his bond he was
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy let him
look to his bond
Why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take
his flesh whats that good for
To bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else
it will feed my revenge He hath disgraced me and
hindered me half a million laughed at my losses
mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my
bargains cooled my friends heated mine
enemies and whats his reason I am a Jew Hath
not a Jew eyes hath not a Jew hands organs
dimensions senses affections passions fed with
the same food hurt with the same weapons subject
to the same diseases healed by the same means
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as
a Christian is If you prick us do we not bleed
if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison
us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not
revenge If we are like you in the rest we will
resemble you in that If a Jew wrong a Christian
what is his humility Revenge If a Christian
wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be by
Christian example Why revenge The villany you
teach me I will execute and it shall go hard but I
will better the instruction
Enter a Servant
Gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and
desires to speak with you both
We have been up and down to seek him
Enter TUBAL
Here comes another of the tribe a third cannot be
matched unless the devil himself turn Jew
Exeunt SALANIO SALARINO and Servant
How now Tubal what news from Genoa hast thou

precious precious jewels I would my daughter

her coffin No news of them Why so and I know

shoulders no sighs but of my breathing no tears

Yes other men have ill luck too Antonio as I
heard in Genoa

I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck
I thank thee good Tubal good news good news

Your daughter spent in Genoa as I heard in one
night fourscore ducats
Thou stickest a dagger in me I shall never see my
gold again fourscore ducats at a sitting

There came divers of Antonios creditors in my
company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break
I am very glad of it Ill plague him Ill torture

One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
daughter for a monkey
Out upon her Thou torturest me Tubal it was my
turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor

will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were

will Go go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue

Exeunt
Enter BASSANIO PORTIA GRATIANO NERISSA and Attendants
I pray you tarry pause a day or two
Before you hazard for in choosing wrong
I lose your company therefore forbear awhile
Theres something tells me but it is not love
I would not lose you and you know yourself
Hate counsels not in such a quality
But lest you should not understand me well
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me I could teach you
How to choose right but I am then forsworn
So will I never be so may you miss me
But if you do youll make me wish a sin
That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes
They have oerlookd me and divided me
One half of me is yours the other half yours
Mine own I would say but if mine then yours
And so all yours O these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights
And so though yours not yours Prove it so
Let fortune go to hell for it not I
I speak too long but tis to peize the time
To eke it and to draw it out in length
To stay you from election
Let me choose
For as I am I live upon the rack
Upon the rack Bassanio then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love
None but that ugly treason of mistrust
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love
There may as well be amity and life
Tween snow and fire as treason and my love
Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack
Where men enforced do speak anything
Promise me life and Ill confess the truth
Well then confess and live
Confess and love
Had been the very sum of my confession
O happy torment when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance
But let me to my fortune and the caskets
Away then I am lockd in one of them
If you do love me you will find me out
Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
Let music sound while he doth make his choice
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end
Fading in music that the comparison
May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
And watery deathbed for him He may win
And what is music then Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
To a newcrowned monarch such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
That creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear
And summon him to marriage Now he goes
With no less presence but with much more love
Than young Alcides when he did redeem
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the seamonster I stand for sacrifice
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives
With bleared visages come forth to view
The issue of the exploit Go Hercules
Live thou I live with much much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray
Music whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
SONG
Tell me where is fancy bred
Or in the heart or in the head
How begot how nourished
Reply reply
It is engenderd in the eyes
With gazing fed and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies
Let us all ring fancys knell
Ill begin itDing dong bell
Ding dong bell
So may the outward shows be least themselves
The world is still deceived with ornament
In law what plea so tainted and corrupt
But being seasoned with a gracious voice
Obscures the show of evil In religion
What damned error but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts
How many cowards whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars
Who inward searchd have livers white as milk
And these assume but valours excrement
To render them redoubted Look on beauty
And you shall see tis purchased by the weight
Which therein works a miracle in nature
Making them lightest that wear most of it
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind
Upon supposed fairness often known
To be the dowry of a second head
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty in a word
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold
Hard food for Midas I will none of thee
Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence
And here choose I joy be the consequence
Aside  How all the other passions fleet to air
As doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair
And shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy O love
Be moderate allay thy ecstasy
In measure rein thy joy scant this excess
I feel too much thy blessing make it less
For fear I surfeit
What find I here
Opening the leaden casket
Fair Portias counterfeit What demigod
Hath come so near creation Move these eyes
Or whether riding on the balls of mine
Seem they in motion Here are severd lips
Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
Faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes
How could he see to do them having made one
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
And leave itself unfurnishd Yet look how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it so far this shadow
Doth limp behind the substance Heres the scroll
The continent and summary of my fortune
Reads
You that choose not by the view
Chance as fair and choose as true
Since this fortune falls to you
Be content and seek no new
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss
A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave
I come by note to give and to receive
Like one of two contending in a prize
That thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes
Hearing applause and universal shout
Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no
So thrice fair lady stand I even so
As doubtful whether what I see be true
Until confirmd signd ratified by you
You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand
Such as I am though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish
To wish myself much better yet for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself
A thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
That only to stand high in your account
I might in virtue beauties livings friends
Exceed account but the full sum of me
Is sum of something which to term in gross
Happy in this she is not yet so old
But she may learn happier than this
She is not bred so dull but she can learn
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed
As from her lord her governor her king
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion master of my servants
Queen oer myself and even now but now
This house these servants and this same myself
Are yours my lord I give them with this ring
Which when you part from lose or give away
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you
Madam you have bereft me of all words
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins
And there is such confusion in my powers
As after some oration fairly spoke
By a beloved prince there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude
Where every something being blent together
Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
Expressd and not expressd But when this ring
Parts from this finger then parts life from hence
O then be bold to say Bassanios dead
My lord and lady it is now our time
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
To cry good joy good joy my lord and lady
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady
I wish you all the joy that you can wish
For I am sure you can wish none from me
And when your honours mean to solemnize
The bargain of your faith I do beseech you
Even at that time I may be married too
With all my heart so thou canst get a wife
I thank your lordship you have got me one
My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
You saw the mistress I beheld the maid
You loved I loved for intermission
No more pertains to me my lord than you
Your fortune stood upon the casket there
And so did mine too as the matter falls
For wooing here until I sweat again
And sweating until my very roof was dry
With oaths of love at last if promise last
I got a promise of this fair one here
To have her love provided that your fortune
Achieved her mistress
Is this true Nerissa
Madam it is so you stand pleased withal
And do you Gratiano mean good faith
Yes faith my lord
Our feast shall be much honourd in your marriage
Well play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
What and stake down
No we shall neer win at that sport and stake down
But who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel What
and my old Venetian friend Salerio
Enter LORENZO JESSICA and SALERIO a Messenger from Venice
Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hither
If that the youth of my new interest here
Have power to bid you welcome By your leave
I bid my very friends and countrymen
Sweet Portia welcome
So do I my lord
They are entirely welcome
I thank your honour For my part my lord
My purpose was not to have seen you here
But meeting with Salerio by the way
He did entreat me past all saying nay
To come with him along
I did my lord
And I have reason for it Signior Antonio
Commends him to you
Gives Bassanio a letter
Ere I ope his letter
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
Not sick my lord unless it be in mind
Nor well unless in mind his letter there
Will show you his estate
Nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
Your hand Salerio whats the news from Venice
How doth that royal merchant good Antonio
I know he will be glad of our success
We are the Jasons we have won the fleece
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
That steals the colour from Bassanios cheek
Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man What worse and worse
With leave Bassanio I am half yourself
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you
O sweet Portia
Here are a few of the unpleasantst words
That ever blotted paper Gentle lady
When I did first impart my love to you
I freely told you all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins I was a gentleman
And then I told you true and yet dear lady
Rating myself at nothing you shall see
How much I was a braggart When I told you
My state was nothing I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing for indeed
I have engaged myself to a dear friend
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy
To feed my means Here is a letter lady
The paper as the body of my friend
And every word in it a gaping wound
Issuing lifeblood But is it true Salerio
Have all his ventures faild What not one hit
From Tripolis from Mexico and England
From Lisbon Barbary and India
And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
Of merchantmarring rocks
Not one my lord
Besides it should appear that if he had
The present money to discharge the Jew
He would not take it Never did I know
A creature that did bear the shape of man
So keen and greedy to confound a man
He plies the duke at morning and at night
And doth impeach the freedom of the state
If they deny him justice twenty merchants
The duke himself and the magnificoes
Of greatest port have all persuaded with him
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture of justice and his bond
When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen
That he would rather have Antonios flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him and I know my lord
If law authority and power deny not
It will go hard with poor Antonio
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
The dearest friend to me the kindest man
The bestconditiond and unwearied spirit
In doing courtesies and one in whom
The ancient Roman honour more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy
What sum owes he the Jew
For me three thousand ducats
What no more
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond
Double six thousand and then treble that
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanios fault
First go with me to church and call me wife
And then away to Venice to your friend
For never shall you lie by Portias side
With an unquiet soul You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over
When it is paid bring your true friend along
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows Come away
For you shall hence upon your weddingday
Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
Since you are dear bought I will love you dear
But let me hear the letter of your friend
Reads  Sweet Bassanio my ships have all
miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is
very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since
in paying it it is impossible I should live all
debts are cleared between you and I if I might but
see you at my death Notwithstanding use your
pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come
let not my letter
O love dispatch all business and be gone
Since I have your good leave to go away
I will make haste but till I come again
No bed shall eer be guilty of my stay
No rest be interposer twixt us twain
Exeunt
Enter SHYLOCK SALARINO ANTONIO and Gaoler
Gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy
This is the fool that lent out money gratis
Gaoler look to him
Hear me yet good Shylock
Ill have my bond speak not against my bond
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond
Thou calldst me dog before thou hadst a cause
But since I am a dog beware my fangs
The duke shall grant me justice I do wonder
Thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request
I pray thee hear me speak
Ill have my bond I will not hear thee speak
Ill have my bond and therefore speak no more
Ill not be made a soft and dulleyed fool
To shake the head relent and sigh and yield
To Christian intercessors Follow not
Ill have no speaking I will have my bond
Exit
It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men
Let him alone
Ill follow him no more with bootless prayers
He seeks my life his reason well I know
I oft deliverd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me
Therefore he hates me
I am sure the duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold
The duke cannot deny the course of law
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice if it be denied
Will much impeach the justice of his state
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations Therefore go
These griefs and losses have so bated me
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
Tomorrow to my bloody creditor
Well gaoler on Pray God Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt and then I care not
Exeunt
Enter PORTIA NERISSA LORENZO JESSICA and BALTHASAR
Madam although I speak it in your presence
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of godlike amity which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord
But if you  knew to whom you show this honour
How true a gentleman you send relief
How dear a lover of my lord your husband
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you
I never did repent for doing good
Nor shall not now for in companions
That do converse and waste the time together
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments of manners and of spirit
Which makes me think that this Antonio
Being the bosom lover of my lord
Must needs be like my lord If it be so
How little is the cost I have bestowd
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery
This comes too near the praising of myself
Therefore no more of it hear other things
Lorenzo I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house
Until my lords return for mine own part
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
To live in prayer and contemplation
Only attended by Nerissa here
Until her husband and my lords return
There is a monastery two miles off
And there will we abide I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you
Madam with all my heart
I shall obey you in all fair commands
My people do already know my mind
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself
And so farewell till we shall meet again
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
I wish your ladyship all hearts content
I thank you for your wish and am well pleased
To wish it back on you fare you well Jessica
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
Now Balthasar
As I have ever found thee honesttrue
So let me find thee still Take this same letter
And use thou all the endeavour of a man
In speed to Padua see thou render this
Into my cousins hand Doctor Bellario
And look what notes and garments he doth give thee
Bring them I pray thee with imagined speed
Unto the tranect to the common ferry
Which trades to Venice Waste no time in words
But get thee gone I shall be there before thee
Madam I go with all convenient speed
Exit
Come on Nerissa I have work in hand
That you yet know not of well see our husbands
Before they think of us
Shall they see us
They shall Nerissa but in such a habit
That they shall think we are accomplished
With that we lack Ill hold thee any wager
When we are both accoutred like young men
Ill prove the prettier fellow of the two
And wear my dagger with the braver grace
And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
How honourable ladies sought my love
Which I denying they fell sick and died
I could not do withal then Ill repent
And wish for all that that I had not killed them
And twenty of these puny lies Ill tell
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
Above a twelvemonth I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks
Why shall we turn to men
Fie what a questions that
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter
But come Ill tell thee all my whole device
When I am in my coach which stays for us
At the park gate and therefore haste away
For we must measure twenty miles today
Exeunt
Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA
Yes truly for look you the sins of the father
are to be laid upon the children therefore I
promise ye I fear you I was always plain with
you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter
therefore be of good cheer for truly I think you
are damned There is but one hope in it that can do
you any good and that is but a kind of bastard
hope neither
And what hope is that I pray thee
Marry you may partly hope that your father got you
not that you are not the Jews daughter
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the
sins of my mother should be visited upon me
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I
fall into Charybdis your mother well you are
gone both ways
I shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a
Christian
Truly the more to blame he we were Christians
enow before een as many as could well live one by
another This making Christians will raise the
price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
Enter LORENZO
Ill tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comes
I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if
you thus get my wife into corners
Nay you need not fear us Lorenzo Launcelot and I
are out He tells me flatly there is no mercy for
me in heaven because I am a Jews daughter and he
says you are no good member of the commonwealth
for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the
price of pork
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
you can the getting up of the negros belly the
Moor is with child by you Launcelot
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason
but if she be less than an honest woman she is
indeed more than I took her for
How every fool can play upon the word I think the
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence
and discourse grow commendable in none only but
parrots Go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner
That is done sir they have all stomachs
Goodly Lord what a witsnapper are you then bid
them prepare dinner
That is done too sir only cover is the word
Will you cover then sir
Not so sir neither I know my duty
Yet more quarrelling with occasion Wilt thou show
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray
tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning
go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve
in the meat and we will come in to dinner
For the table sir it shall be served in for the
meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in
to dinner sir why let it be as humours and
conceits shall govern
Exit
O dear discretion how his words are suited
The fool hath planted in his memory
An army of good words and I do know
A many fools that stand in better place
Garnishd like him that for a tricksy word
Defy the matter How cheerest thou Jessica
And now good sweet say thy opinion
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanios wife
Past all expressing It is very meet
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life
For having such a blessing in his lady
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth
And if on earth he do not mean it then
In reason he should never come to heaven
Why if two gods should play some heavenly match
And on the wager lay two earthly women
And Portia one there must be something else
Pawnd with the other for the poor rude world
Hath not her fellow
Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife
Nay but ask my opinion too of that
I will anon first let us go to dinner
Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach
No pray thee let it serve for tabletalk
Then howsoer thou speakst mong other things
I shall digest it
Well Ill set you forth
Exeunt
Enter the DUKE the Magnificoes ANTONIO BASSANIO GRATIANO SALERIO and others
What is Antonio here
Ready so please your grace
I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
A stony adversary an inhuman wretch
uncapable of pity void and empty
From any dram of mercy
I have heard
Your grace hath taen great pains to qualify
His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envys reach I do oppose
My patience to his fury and am armd
To suffer with a quietness of spirit
The very tyranny and rage of his
Go one and call the Jew into the court
He is ready at the door he comes my lord
Enter SHYLOCK
Make room and let him stand before our face
Shylock the world thinks and I think so too
That thou but leadst this fashion of thy malice
Thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty
Which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
But touchd with human gentleness and love
Forgive a moiety of the principal
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses
That have of late so huddled on his back
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
From stubborn Turks and Tartars never traind
To offices of tender courtesy
We all expect a gentle answer Jew
I have possessd your grace of what I purpose
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond
If you deny it let the danger light
Upon your charter and your citys freedom
Youll ask me why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats Ill not answer that
But say it is my humour is it answerd
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned What are you answerd yet
Some men there are love not a gaping pig
Some that are mad if they behold a cat
And others when the bagpipe sings i the nose
Cannot contain their urine for affection
Mistress of passion sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer
As there is no firm reason to be renderd
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig
Why he a harmless necessary cat
Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend himself being offended
So can I give no reason nor I will not
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio that I follow thus
A losing suit against him Are you answerd
This is no answer thou unfeeling man
To excuse the current of thy cruelty
I am not bound to please thee with my answers
Do all men kill the things they do not love
Hates any man the thing he would not kill
Every offence is not a hate at first
What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
I pray you think you question with the Jew
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
You may as well do anything most hard
As seek to soften thatthan which whats harder
His Jewish heart therefore I do beseech you
Make no more offers use no farther means
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will
For thy three thousand ducats here is six
What judgment shall I dread doing
Were in six parts and every part a ducat
I would not draw them I would have my bond
How shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong
You have among you many a purchased slave
Which like your asses and your dogs and mules
You use in abject and in slavish parts
Because you bought them shall I say to you
Let them be free marry them to your heirs
Why sweat they under burthens let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Be seasond with such viands You will answer
The slaves are ours so do I answer you
The pound of flesh which I demand of him
Is dearly bought tis mine and I will have it
If you deny me fie upon your law
There is no force in the decrees of Venice
I stand for judgment answer shall I have it
Upon my power I may dismiss this court
Unless Bellario a learned doctor
Whom I have sent for to determine this
Come here today
My lord here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor
New come from Padua
Bring us the letter call the messenger
Good cheer Antonio What man courage yet
The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
I am a tainted wether of the flock
Meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground and so let me
You cannot better be employd Bassanio
Than to live still and write mine epitaph
Enter NERISSA dressed like a lawyers clerk
Came you from Padua from Bellario
From both my lord Bellario greets your grace
Presenting a letter
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew
Thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can
No not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness
Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee
No none that thou hast wit enough to make
O be thou damnd inexecrable dog
And for thy life let justice be accused
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men thy currish spirit
Governd a wolf who hangd for human slaughter
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
And whilst thou layst in thy unhallowd dam
Infused itself in thee for thy desires
Are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
Thou but offendst thy lungs to speak so loud
Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
To cureless ruin I stand here for law
This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court
Where is he
He attendeth here hard by
To know your answer whether youll admit him
With all my heart Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place
Meantime the court shall hear Bellarios letter
Reads
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
your letter I am very sick but in the instant that
your messenger came in loving visitation was with
me a young doctor of Rome his name is Balthasar I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the Jew and Antonio the merchant we turned oer
many books together he is furnished with my
opinion which bettered with his own learning the
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes
with him at my importunity to fill up your graces
request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation for I never knew so young a body with so
old a head I leave him to your gracious
acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
commendation
You hear the learnd Bellario what he writes
And here I take it is the doctor come
Enter PORTIA dressed like a doctor of laws
Give me your hand Come you from old Bellario
I did my lord
You are welcome take your place
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court
I am informed thoroughly of the cause
Which is the merchant here and which the Jew
Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth
Is your name Shylock
Shylock is my name
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed
You stand within his danger do you not
Ay so he says
Do you confess the bond
I do
Then must the Jew be merciful
On what compulsion must I tell me that
The quality of mercy is not straind
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath it is twice blest
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power
The attribute to awe and majesty
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
But mercy is above this sceptred sway
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings
It is an attribute to God himself
And earthly power doth then show likest Gods
When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew
Though justice be thy plea consider this
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation we do pray for mercy
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea
Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there
My deeds upon my head I crave the law
The penalty and forfeit of my bond
Is he not able to discharge the money
Yes here I tender it for him in the court
Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
I will be bound to pay it ten times oer
On forfeit of my hands my head my heart
If this will not suffice it must appear
That malice bears down truth And I beseech you
Wrest once the law to your authority
To do a great right do a little wrong
And curb this cruel devil of his will
It must not be there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established
Twill be recorded for a precedent
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state it cannot be
A Daniel come to judgment yea a Daniel
O wise young judge how I do honour thee
I pray you let me look upon the bond
Here tis most reverend doctor here it is
Shylock theres thrice thy money offerd thee
An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul
No not for Venice
Why this bond is forfeit
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchants heart Be merciful
Take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
When it is paid according to the tenor
It doth appear you are a worthy judge
You know the law your exposition
Hath been most sound I charge you by the law
Whereof you are a welldeserving pillar
Proceed to judgment by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me I stay here on my bond
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment
Why then thus it is
You must prepare your bosom for his knife
O noble judge O excellent young man
For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty
Which here appeareth due upon the bond
Tis very true O wise and upright judge
How much more elder art thou than thy looks
Therefore lay bare your bosom
Ay his breast
So says the bond doth it not noble judge
Nearest his heart those are the very words
It is so Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh
I have them ready
Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge
To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
Is it so nominated in the bond
It is not so expressd but what of that
Twere good you do so much for charity
I cannot find it tis not in the bond
You merchant have you any thing to say
But little I am armd and well prepared
Give me your hand Bassanio fare you well
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off
Commend me to your honourable wife
Tell her the process of Antonios end
Say how I loved you speak me fair in death
And when the tale is told bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend
And he repents not that he pays your debt
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough
Ill pay it presently with all my heart
Antonio I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself
But life itself my wife and all the world
Are not with me esteemd above thy life
I would lose all ay sacrifice them all
Here to this devil to deliver you
Your wife would give you little thanks for that
If she were by to hear you make the offer
I have a wife whom I protest I love
I would she were in heaven so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew
Tis well you offer it behind her back
The wish would make else an unquiet house
These be the Christian husbands I have a daughter
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian
Aside
We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence
A pound of that same merchants flesh is thine
The court awards it and the law doth give it
Most rightful judge
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast
The law allows it and the court awards it
Most learned judge A sentence Come prepare
Tarry a little there is something else
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
The words expressly are a pound of flesh
Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
But in the cutting it if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods
Are by the laws of Venice confiscate
Unto the state of Venice
O upright judge Mark Jew O learned judge
Is that the law
For as thou urgest justice be assured
Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
O learned judge Mark Jew a learned judge
I take this offer then pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go
Here is the money
Soft
The Jew shall have all justice soft no haste
He shall have nothing but the penalty
O Jew an upright judge a learned judge
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh if thou cutst more
Or less than a just pound be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
A second Daniel a Daniel Jew
Now infidel I have you on the hip
Why doth the Jew pause take thy forfeiture
Give me my principal and let me go
I have it ready for thee here it is
He hath refused it in the open court
He shall have merely justice and his bond
A Daniel still say I a second Daniel
I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word
Shall I not have barely my principal
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
To be so taken at thy peril Jew
Why then the devil give him good of it
Ill stay no longer question
Tarry Jew
The law hath yet another hold on you
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen
The party gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one half his goods the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state
And the offenders life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only gainst all other voice
In which predicament I say thou standst
For it appears by manifest proceeding
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant and thou hast incurrd
The danger formerly by me rehearsed
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
Thou hast not left the value of a cord
Therefore thou must be hangd at the states charge
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
For half thy wealth it is Antonios
The other half comes to the general state
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine
Ay for the state not for Antonio
Nay take my life and all pardon not that
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live
What mercy can you render him Antonio
A halter gratis nothing else for Gods sake
So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods
I am content so he will let me have
The other half in use to render it
Upon his death unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter
Two things provided more that for this favour
He presently become a Christian
The other that he do record a gift
Here in the court of all he dies possessd
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter
He shall do this or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here
Art thou contented Jew what dost thou say
I am content
Clerk draw a deed of gift
I pray you give me leave to go from hence
I am not well send the deed after me
And I will sign it
Get thee gone but do it
In christening shalt thou have two godfathers
Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
To bring thee to the gallows not the font
Exit SHYLOCK
Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon
I must away this night toward Padua
And it is meet I presently set forth
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not
Antonio gratify this gentleman
For in my mind you are much bound to him
Exeunt Duke and his train
Most worthy gentleman I and my friend
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
Of grievous penalties in lieu whereof
Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew
We freely cope your courteous pains withal
And stand indebted over and above
In love and service to you evermore
He is well paid that is well satisfied
And I delivering you am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid
My mind was never yet more mercenary
I pray you know me when we meet again
I wish you well and so I take my leave
Dear sir of force I must attempt you further
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute
Not as a fee grant me two things I pray you
Not to deny me and to pardon me
You press me far and therefore I will yield
To ANTONIO
Give me your gloves Ill wear them for your sake
To BASSANIO
And for your love Ill take this ring from you
Do not draw back your hand Ill take no more
And you in love shall not deny me this
This ring good sir alas it is a trifle
I will not shame myself to give you this
I will have nothing else but only this
And now methinks I have a mind to it
Theres more depends on this than on the value
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you
And find it out by proclamation
Only for this I pray you pardon me
I see sir you are liberal in offers
You taught me first to beg and now methinks
You teach me how a beggar should be answerd
Good sir this ring was given me by my wife
And when she put it on she made me vow
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it
That scuse serves many men to save their gifts
An if your wife be not a madwoman
And know how well I have deserved the ring
She would not hold out enemy for ever
For giving it to me Well peace be with you
Exeunt Portia and Nerissa
My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring
Let his deservings and my love withal
Be valued against your wifes commandment
Go Gratiano run and overtake him
Give him the ring and bring him if thou canst
Unto Antonios house away make haste
Exit Gratiano
Come you and I will thither presently
And in the morning early will we both
Fly toward Belmont come Antonio
Exeunt
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
Inquire the Jews house out give him this deed
And let him sign it well away tonight
And be a day before our husbands home
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo
Enter GRATIANO
Fair sir you are well oertaen
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat
Your company at dinner
That cannot be
His ring I do accept most thankfully
And so I pray you tell him furthermore
I pray you show my youth old Shylocks house
That will I do
Sir I would speak with you
Aside to PORTIA
Ill see if I can get my husbands ring
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever
Aside to NERISSA  Thou mayst I warrant
We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men
But well outface them and outswear them too
Aloud
Away make haste thou knowist where I will tarry
Come good sir will you show me to this house
Exeunt
Enter LORENZO and JESSICA
The moon shines bright in such a night as this
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noise in such a night
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
And sighd his soul toward the Grecian tents
Where Cressid lay that night
In such a night
Did Thisbe fearfully oertrip the dew
And saw the lions shadow ere himself
And ran dismayd away
In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
To come again to Carthage
In such a night
Medea gatherd the enchanted herbs
That did renew old AEson
In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont
In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
And neer a true one
In such a night
Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew
Slander her love and he forgave it her
I would outnight you did no body come
But hark I hear the footing of a man
Enter STEPHANO
Who comes so fast in silence of the night
A friend
A friend what friend your name I pray you friend
Stephano is my name and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont she doth stray about
By holy crosses where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours
Who comes with her
None but a holy hermit and her maid
I pray you is my master yet returnd
He is not nor we have not heard from him
But go we in I pray thee Jessica
And ceremoniously let us prepare
Some welcome for the mistress of the house
Enter LAUNCELOT
Sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
Who calls
Sola did you see Master Lorenzo
Master Lorenzo sola sola
Leave hollaing man here
Sola where where
Here
Tell him theres a post come from my master with
his horn full of good news my master will be here
ere morning
Exit
Sweet soul lets in and there expect their coming
And yet no matter why should we go in
My friend Stephano signify I pray you
Within the house your mistress is at hand
And bring your music forth into the air
Exit Stephano
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony
Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
Theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst
But in his motion like an angel sings
Still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins
Such harmony is in immortal souls
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
Enter Musicians
Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear
And draw her home with music
Music
I am never merry when I hear sweet music
The reason is your spirits are attentive
For do but note a wild and wanton herd
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts
Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
Which is the hot condition of their blood
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
Or any air of music touch their ears
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand
Their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of music therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods
Since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
But music for the time doth change his nature
The man that hath no music in himself
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds
Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections dark as Erebus
Let no such man be trusted Mark the music
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
That light we see is burning in my hall
How far that little candle throws his beams
So shines a good deed in a naughty world
When the moon shone we did not see the candle
So doth the greater glory dim the less
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Unto the king be by and then his state
Empties itself as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters Music hark
It is your music madam of the house
Nothing is good I see without respect
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
Silence bestows that virtue on it madam
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
When neither is attended and I think
The nightingale if she should sing by day
When every goose is cackling would be thought
No better a musician than the wren
How many things by season seasond are
To their right praise and true perfection
Peace ho the moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awaked
Music ceases
That is the voice
Or I am much deceived of Portia
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
By the bad voice
Dear lady welcome home
We have been praying for our husbands healths
Which speed we hope the better for our words
Are they returnd
Madam they are not yet
But there is come a messenger before
To signify their coming
Go in Nerissa
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence
Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you
A tucket sounds
Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet
We are no telltales madam fear you not
This night methinks is but the daylight sick
It looks a little paler tis a day
Such as the day is when the sun is hid
Enter BASSANIO ANTONIO GRATIANO and their followers
We should hold day with the Antipodes
If you would walk in absence of the sun
Let me give light but let me not be light
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband
And never be Bassanio so for me
But God sort all You are welcome home my lord
I thank you madam Give welcome to my friend
This is the man this is Antonio
To whom I am so infinitely bound
You should in all sense be much bound to him
For as I hear he was much bound for you
No more than I am well acquitted of
Sir you are very welcome to our house
It must appear in other ways than words
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy
To NERISSA  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong
In faith I gave it to the judges clerk
Would he were gelt that had it for my part
Since you do take it love so much at heart
A quarrel ho already whats the matter
About a hoop of gold a paltry ring
That she did give me whose posy was
For all the world like cutlers poetry
Upon  a knife Love me and leave me not
What talk you of the posy or the value
You swore to me when I did give it you
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave
Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
You should have been respective and have kept it
Gave it a judges clerk no Gods my judge
The clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had it
He will an if he live to be a man
Ay if a woman live to be a man
Now by this hand I gave it to a youth
A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
No higher than thyself the judges clerk
A prating boy that beggd it as a fee
I could not for my heart deny it him
You were to blame I must be plain with you
To part so slightly with your wifes first gift
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it and here he stands
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
An twere to me I should be mad at it
Aside  Why I were best to cut my left hand off
And swear I lost the ring defending it
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that beggd it and indeed
Deserved it too and then the boy his clerk
That took some pains in writing he beggd mine
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings
What ring gave you my lord
Not that I hope which you received of me
If I could add a lie unto a fault
I would deny it but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it it is gone
Even so void is your false heart of truth
By heaven I will neer come in your bed
Until I see the ring
Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine
Sweet Portia
If you did know to whom I gave the ring
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring
When nought would be accepted but the ring
You would abate the strength of your displeasure
If you had known the virtue of the ring
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring
Or your own honour to contain the ring
You would not then have parted with the ring
What man is there so much unreasonable
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony
Nerissa teaches me what to believe
Ill die fort but some woman had the ring
No by my honour madam by my soul
No woman had it but a civil doctor
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And beggd the ring the which I did deny him
And sufferd him to go displeased away
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady
I was enforced to send it after him
I was beset with shame and courtesy
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it Pardon me good lady
For by these blessed candles of the night
Had you been there I think you would have beggd
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor
Let not that doctor eer come near my house
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved
And that which you did swear to keep for me
I will become as liberal as you
Ill not deny him any thing I have
No not my body nor my husbands bed
Know him I shall I am well sure of it
Lie not a night from home watch me like Argus
If you do not if I be left alone
Now by mine honour which is yet mine own
Ill have that doctor for my bedfellow
And I his clerk therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection
Well do you so let not me take him then
For if I do Ill mar the young clerks pen
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
Sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
Portia forgive me this enforced wrong
And in the hearing of these many friends
I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
Wherein I see myself
Mark you but that
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself
In each eye one swear by your double self
And theres an oath of credit
Nay but hear me
Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee
I once did lend my body for his wealth
Which but for him that had your husbands ring
Had quite miscarried I dare be bound again
My soul upon the forfeit that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly
Then you shall be his surety Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other
Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring
By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor
I had it of him pardon me Bassanio
For by this ring the doctor lay with me
And pardon me my gentle Gratiano
For that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerk
In lieu of this last night did lie with me
Why this is like the mending of highways
In summer where the ways are fair enough
What are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
Speak not so grossly You are all amazed
Here is a letter read it at your leisure
It comes from Padua from Bellario
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor
Nerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now returnd I have not yet
Enterd my house Antonio you are welcome
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect unseal this letter soon
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbour suddenly
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter
I am dumb
Were you the doctor and I knew you not
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
Ay but the clerk that never means to do it
Unless he live until he be a man
Sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
When I am absent then lie with my wife
Sweet lady you have given me life and living
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road
How now Lorenzo
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you
Ay and Ill give them him without a fee
There do I give to you and Jessica
From the rich Jew a special deed of gift
After his death of all he dies possessd of
Fair ladies you drop manna in the way
Of starved people
It is almost morning
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full Let us go in
And charge us there upon intergatories
And we will answer all things faithfully
Let it be so the first intergatory
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is
Whether till the next night she had rather stay
Or go to bed now being two hours to day
But were the day come I should wish it dark
That I were couching with the doctors clerk
Well while I live Ill fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissas ring
Exeunt

world One that is wellnigh worn to pieces with
age to show himself a young gallant What an
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
pickedwith the devils nameout of my
conversation that he dares in this manner assay me
Why he hath not been thrice in my company What
should I say to him I was then frugal of my
mirth Heaven forgive me Why Ill exhibit a bill
in the parliament for the putting down of men How

as sure as his guts are made of puddings

Faith but you do in my mind

contrary O Mistress Page give me some counsel
Whats the matter woman
O woman if it were not for one trifling respect I
could come to such honour
Hang the trifle woman take the honour What is
it dispense with trifles what is it
If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so
I could be knighted
What thou liest Sir Alice Ford These knights
will hack and so thou shouldst not alter the
article of thy gentry
We burn daylight here read read perceive how I
might be knighted I shall think the worse of fat
men as long as I have an eye to make difference of
mens liking and yet he would not swear praised
womens modesty and gave such orderly and
wellbehaved reproof to all uncomeliness that I
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
the truth of his words but they do no more adhere
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
the tune of Green Sleeves What tempest I trow
threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his
belly ashore at Windsor How shall I be revenged
on him I think the best way were to entertain him
with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted
him in his own grease Did you ever hear the like
Letter for letter but that the name of Page and
Ford differs To thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions heres the twinbrother of thy
letter but let thine inherit first for I
protest mine never shall I warrant he hath a
thousand of these letters writ with blank space for
different namessure moreand these are of the
second edition he will print them out of doubt
for he cares not what he puts into the press when
he would put us two I had rather be a giantess
and lie under Mount Pelion Well I will find you
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man
Why this is the very same the very hand the very
words What doth he think of us
Nay I know not it makes me almost ready to
wrangle with mine own honesty Ill entertain
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal
for sure unless he know some strain in me that I
know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury
Boarding call you it Ill be sure to keep him
above deck
So will Iif he come under my hatches Ill never
to sea again Lets be revenged on him lets
appoint him a meeting give him a show of comfort in
his suit and lead him on with a finebaited delay
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter
that may not sully the chariness of our honesty O
that my husband saw this letter it would give
eternal food to his jealousy
Why look where he comes and my good man too hes
as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause
and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance
You are the happier woman

with youand you have been a man long known to me
though I had never so good means as desire to make
myself acquainted with you I shall discover a
thing to you wherein I must very much lay open mine
own imperfection but good Sir John as you have
one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded
turn another into the register of your own that I
may pass with a reproof the easier sith you
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender
Very well sir proceed
There is a gentlewoman in this town her husbands
name is Ford
Well sir
I have long loved her and I protest to you
bestowed much on her followed her with a doting
observance engrossed opportunities to meet her
feed every slight occasion that could but niggardly
give me sight of her not only bought many presents
to give her but have given largely to many to know
what she would have given briefly I have pursued
her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the
wing of all occasions But whatsoever I have
merited either in my mind or in my means meed
I am sure I have received none unless experience
be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
rate and that hath taught me to say this
Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
Pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues
Never
Have you importuned her to such a purpose
Never
Of what quality was your love then
Like a fair house built on another mans ground so
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
where I erected it
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me
When I have told you that I have told you all
Some say that though she appear honest to me yet in
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
there is shrewd construction made of her Now Sir
John here is the heart of my purpose you are a
gentleman of excellent breeding admirable
discourse of great admittance authentic in your
place and person generally allowed for your many
warlike courtlike and learned preparations
O sir
Believe it for you know it There is money spend
it spend it spend more spend all I have only
give me so much of your time in exchange of it as
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
Fords wife use your art of wooing win her to
consent to you if any man may you may as soon as
any
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection that I should win what you would enjoy
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously
O understand my drift She dwells so securely on
the excellency of her honour that the folly of my
soul dares not present itself she is too bright to
be looked against Now could I could come to her
with any detection in my hand my desires had
instance and argument to commend themselves I
could drive her then from the ward of her purity
her reputation her marriagevow and a thousand
other her defences which now are too too strongly
embattled against me What say you tot Sir John
Master Brook I will first make bold with your
money next give me your hand and last as I am a
gentleman you shall if you will enjoy Fords wife
O good sir
I say you shall
Want no money Sir John you shall want none
Want no Mistress Ford Master Brook you shall want
none I shall be with her I may tell you by her
own appointment even as you came in to me her
assistant or gobetween parted from me I say I
shall be with her between ten and eleven for at
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
will be forth Come you to me at night you shall
know how I speed

throwing him into the water will do him a benefit
Hang him dishonest rascal I would all of the same
strain were in the same distress
I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
Falstaffs being here for I never saw him so gross
in his jealousy till now
I will lay a plot to try that and we will yet have
more tricks with Falstaff his dissolute disease will
scarce obey this medicine
Shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress
Quickly to him and excuse his throwing into the
water and give him another hope to betray him to
another punishment

Very illfavoredly Master Brook
How so sir Did she change her determination
No Master Brook but the peaking Cornuto her
husband Master Brook dwelling in a continual
larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our
encounter after we had embraced kissed protested
and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy
and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither
provoked and instigated by his distemper and
forsooth to search his house for his wifes love
What while you were there
While I was there
And did he search for you and could not find you
You shall hear As good luck would have it comes
in one Mistress Page gives intelligence of Fords
approach and in her invention and Fords wifes
A buckbasket
By the Lord a buckbasket rammed me in with foul
shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy
napkins that Master Brook there was the rankest
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril
And how long lay you there
Nay you shall hear Master Brook what I have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good
Being thus crammed in the basket a couple of Fords
knaves his hinds were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Datchetlane they took me on their shoulders met
the jealous knave their master in the door who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it but fate ordaining he
should be a cuckold held his hand Well on went he
for a search and away went I for foul clothes But
mark the sequel Master Brook I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths first an intolerable
fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
bellwether next to be compassed like a good
bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to
point heel to head and then to be stopped in
like a strong distillation with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease think of thata
man of my kidneythink of thatthat am as subject
to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution
and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation
And in the height of this bath when I was more than
half stewed in grease like a Dutch dish to be
thrown into the Thames and cooled glowing hot
in that surge like a horseshoe think of
thathissing hotthink of that Master Brook
In good sadness I am sorry that for my sake you
have sufferd all this My suit then is desperate
youll undertake her no more
Master Brook I will be thrown into Etna as I have
been into Thames ere I will leave her thus Her
husband is this morning gone abirding I have
received from her another embassy of meeting twixt
eight and nine is the hour Master Brook
Tis past eight already sir
Is it I will then address me to my appointment
Come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall
know how I speed and the conclusion shall be
crowned with your enjoying her Adieu You shall
have her Master Brook Master Brook you shall

Enter PAGE FORD MISTRESS PAGE MISTRESS FORD and SIR HUGH EVANS
Tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever
I did look upon
And did he send you both these letters at an instant
Within a quarter of an hour
Pardon me wife Henceforth do what thou wilt
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness now doth thy honour stand
In him that was of late an heretic
As firm as faith
Tis well tis well no more
Be not as extreme in submission
As in offence
But let our plot go forward let our wives
Yet once again to make us public sport
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it
There is no better way than that they spoke of
How to send him word theyll meet him in the park
at midnight Fie fie hell never come
You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
been grievously peaten as an old oman methinks
there should be terrors in him that he should not
come methinks his flesh is punished he shall have
no desires
So think I too
Devise but how youll use him when he comes
And let us two devise to bring him thither
There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest
Doth all the wintertime at still midnight
Walk round about an oak with great raggd horns
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milchkine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner
You have heard of such a spirit and well you know
The superstitious idleheaded eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth
Why yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Hernes oak
But what of this
Marry this is our device
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us
Well let it not be doubted but hell come
And in this shape when you have brought him thither
What shall be done with him what is your plot
That likewise have we thought upon and thus
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth well dress
Like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
And rattles in their hands upon a sudden
As Falstaff she and I are newly met
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song upon their sight
We two in great amazedness will fly
Then let them all encircle him about
And fairylike topinch the unclean knight
And ask him why that hour of fairy revel
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane
And till he tell the truth
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
And burn him with their tapers
The truth being known
Well all present ourselves dishorn the spirit
And mock him home to Windsor
The children must
I will teach the children their behaviors and I
will be like a jackanapes also to burn the
knight with my taber
That will be excellent Ill go and buy them vizards
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies
Finely attired in a robe of white
That silk will I go buy
Aside
And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
And marry her at Eton Go send to Falstaff straight
Nay Ill to him again in name of Brook
Hell tell me all his purpose sure hell come
Fear not you that Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies
Let us about it it is admirable pleasures and fery
honest knaveries

That neither singly can be manifested
Without the show of both fat Falstaff
Ill show you here at large Hark good mine host
Tonight at Hernes oak just twixt twelve and one
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen
The purpose why is here in which disguise
While other jests are something rank on foot
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry she hath consented Now sir
Her mother ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away
While other sports are tasking of their minds
And at the deanery where a priest attends
Straight marry her to this her mothers plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor Now thus it rests
Her father means she shall be all in white
And in that habit when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go
She shall go with him her mother hath intended
The better to denote her to the doctor
For they must all be maskd and vizarded
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed
With ribands pendent flaring bout her head
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
To pinch her by the hand and on that token
The maid hath given consent to go with him
Which means she to deceive father or mother
Both my good host to go along with me
And here it rests that youll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church twixt twelve and one
And in the lawful name of marrying
To give our hearts united ceremony
Well husband your device Ill to the vicar
Bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest
So shall I evermore be bound to thee
Besides Ill make a present recompense

You moonshine revellers and shades of night
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny
Attend your office and your quality
Crier Hobgoblin make the fairy oyes
Elves list your names silence you airy toys
Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap
Where fires thou findst unraked and hearths unswept
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery
They are fairies he that speaks to them shall die
Ill wink and couch no man their works must eye
Lies down upon his face
Wheres Bede Go you and where you find a maid
That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said
Raise up the organs of her fantasy
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy
But those as sleep and think not on their sins
Pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shins
About about
Search Windsor Castle elves within and out
Strew good luck ouphes on every sacred room
That it may stand till the perpetual doom
In state as wholesome as in state tis fit
Worthy the owner and the owner it
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower
Each fair instalment coat and several crest
With loyal blazon evermore be blest
And nightly meadowfairies look you sing
Like to the Garters compass in a ring
The expressure that it bears green let it be
More fertilefresh than all the field to see
And Honi soit qui mal y pense write
In emerald tufts flowers purple blue and white
Let sapphire pearl and rich embroidery
Buckled below fair knighthoods bending knee
Away disperse but till tis one oclock
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter let us not forget
Pray you lock hand in hand yourselves in order set
And twenty glowworms shall our lanterns be
To guide our measure round about the tree
But stay I smell a man of middleearth
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy lest he
transform me to a piece of cheese
Vile worm thou wast oerlookd even in thy birth
With trialfire touch me his fingerend
If he be chaste the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain but if he start
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart
A trial come
Come will this wood take fire
They burn him with their tapers
Oh Oh Oh
Corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
About him fairies sing a scornful rhyme
And as you trip still pinch him to your time
SONG
Fie on sinful fantasy
Fie on lust and luxury
Lust is but a bloody fire
Kindled with unchaste desire
Fed in heart whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them higher and higher
Pinch him fairies mutually
Pinch him for his villany
Pinch him and burn him and turn him about
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out
During this song they pinch FALSTAFF DOCTOR CAIUS  comes one way and steals away a boy in green  SLENDER another way and takes off a boy in white  and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE  A noise of hunting is heard within All the  Fairies run away FALSTAFF pulls off his bucks head and rises

Sir John we have had ill luck we could never meet
I will never take you for my love again but I will
always count you my deer
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass
Ay and an ox too both the proofs are extant
And these are not fairies I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies and yet
the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my
powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason that they were fairies See now
how wit may be made a JackaLent when tis upon
ill employment
Sir John Falstaff serve Got and leave your
desires and fairies will not pinse you
Well said fairy Hugh
And leave your jealousies too I pray you
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it that
it wants matter to prevent so gross oerreaching as
this Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too shall I
have a coxcomb of frize Tis time I were choked
with a piece of toasted cheese
Seese is not good to give putter your belly is all putter
Seese and putter have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English This
is enough to be the decay of lust and latewalking
through the realm
Why Sir John do you think though we would have the
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell
that ever the devil could have made you our delight
What a hodgepudding a bag of flax
A puffed man
Old cold withered and of intolerable entrails
And one that is as slanderous as Satan
And as poor as Job
And as wicked as his wife
And given to fornications and to taverns and sack
and wine and metheglins and to drinkings and
swearings and starings pribbles and prabbles
Well I am your theme you have the start of me I
am dejected I am not able to answer the Welsh
flannel ignorance itself is a plummet oer me use
me as you will
Marry sir well bring you to Windsor to one
Master Brook that you have cozened of money to
whom you should have been a pander over and above
that you have suffered I think to repay that money
will be a biting affliction
Yet be cheerful knight thou shalt eat a posset

should have swinged me If I did not think it had
been Anne Page would I might never stirand tis
a postmasters boy
Upon my life then you took the wrong
What need you tell me that I think so when I took
a boy for a girl If I had been married to him for
all he was in womans apparel I would not have had
him
Why this is your own folly Did not I tell you how
you should know my daughter by her garments
I went to her in white and cried mum and she
cried budget as Anne and I had appointed and yet

How now Master Fenton
Pardon good father good my mother pardon
Now mistress how chance you went not with Master Slender
Why went you not with master doctor maid
You do amaze her hear the truth of it
You would have married her most shamefully
Where there was no proportion held in love
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
The offence is holy that she hath committed
And this deceit loses the name of craft
Of disobedience or unduteous title
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her
Stand not amazed here is no remedy
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state
Money buys lands and wives are sold by fate
I am glad though you have taen a special stand to
strike at me that your arrow hath glanced
Well what remedy Fenton heaven give thee joy
What cannot be eschewd must be embraced
When nightdogs run all sorts of deer are chased
Well I will muse no further Master Fenton
Heaven give you many many merry days
Good husband let us every one go home
And laugh this sport oer by a country fire

Draws on apace four happy days bring in
Another moon but O methinks how slow
This old moon wanes she lingers my desires
Like to a stepdame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man revenue
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night
Four nights will quickly dream away the time
And then the moon like to a silver bow
Newbent in heaven shall behold the night
Of our solemnities
Go Philostrate
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
Turn melancholy forth to funerals
The pale companion is not for our pomp
Exit PHILOSTRATE
Hippolyta I wood thee with my sword
And won thy love doing thee injuries
But I will wed thee in another key
With pomp with triumph and with revelling
Enter EGEUS HERMIA LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS
Happy be Theseus our renowned duke
Thanks good Egeus whats the news with thee
Full of vexation come I with complaint
Against my child my daughter Hermia
Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord
This man hath my consent to marry her
Stand forth Lysander and my gracious duke
This man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child
Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes
And interchanged lovetokens with my child
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
With feigning voice verses of feigning love
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
Of strong prevailment in unhardend youth
With cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart
Turnd her obedience which is due to me
To stubborn harshness and my gracious duke
Be it so she will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens
As she is mine I may dispose of her
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death according to our law
Immediately provided in that case
What say you Hermia be advised fair maid
To you your father should be as a god
One that composed your beauties yea and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman
So is Lysander
In himself he is
But in this kind wanting your fathers voice
The other must be held the worthier
I would my father lookd but with my eyes
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look
I do entreat your grace to pardon me
I know not by what power I am made bold
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case
If I refuse to wed Demetrius
Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men
Therefore fair Hermia question your desires
Know of your youth examine well your blood
Whether if you yield not to your fathers choice
You can endure the livery of a nun
For aye to be in shady cloister mewd
To live a barren sister all your life
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
Thriceblessed they that master so their blood
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage
But earthlier happy is the rose distilld
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows lives and dies in single blessedness
So will I grow so live so die my lord
Ere I will my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty
Take time to pause and by the nest new moon
The sealingday betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your fathers will
Or else to wed Demetrius as he would
Or on Dianas altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life
Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right
You have her fathers love Demetrius
Let me have Hermias do you marry him
Scornful Lysander true he hath my love
And what is mine my love shall render him
And she is mine and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius
I am my lord as well derived as he
As well possessd my love is more than his
My fortunes every way as fairly rankd
If not with vantage as Demetrius
And which is more than all these boasts can be
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia
Why should not I then prosecute my right
Demetrius Ill avouch it to his head
Made love to Nedars daughter Helena
And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
Upon this spotted and inconstant man
I must confess that I have heard so much
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
But being overfull of selfaffairs
My mind did lose it But Demetrius come
And come Egeus you shall go with me
I have some private schooling for you both
For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your fathers will
Or else the law of Athens yields you up
Which by no means we may extenuate
To death or to a vow of single life
Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love
Demetrius and Egeus go along
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves
With duty and desire we follow you
Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
How now my love why is your cheek so pale
How chance the roses there do fade so fast
Belike for want of rain which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
Ay me for aught that I could ever read
Could ever hear by tale or history
The course of true love never did run smooth
But either it was different in blood
O cross too high to be enthralld to low
Or else misgraffed in respect of years
O spite too old to be engaged to young
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends
O hell to choose love by anothers eyes
Or if there were a sympathy in choice
War death or sickness did lay siege to it
Making it momentany as a sound
Swift as a shadow short as any dream
Brief as the lightning in the collied night
That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
And ere a man hath power to say Behold
The jaws of darkness do devour it up
So quick bright things come to confusion
If then true lovers have been ever crossd
It stands as an edict in destiny
Then let us teach our trial patience
Because it is a customary cross
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
Wishes and tears poor fancys followers
A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia
I have a widow aunt a dowager
Of great revenue and she hath no child
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues
And she respects me as her only son
There gentle Hermia may I marry thee
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then
Steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night
And in the wood a league without the town
Where I did meet thee once with Helena
To do observance to a morn of May
There will I stay for thee
My good Lysander
I swear to thee by Cupids strongest bow
By his best arrow with the golden head
By the simplicity of Venus doves
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
And by that fire which burnd the Carthage queen
When the false Troyan under sail was seen
By all the vows that ever men have broke
In number more than ever women spoke
In that same place thou hast appointed me
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee
Keep promise love Look here comes Helena
Enter HELENA
God speed fair Helena whither away
Call you me fair that fair again unsay
Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair
Your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherds ear
When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
Sickness is catching O were favour so
Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go
My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
My tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody
Were the world mine Demetrius being bated
The rest Id give to be to you translated
O teach me how you look and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius heart
I frown upon him yet he loves me still
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
I give him curses yet he gives me love
O that my prayers could such affection move
The more I hate the more he follows me
The more I love the more he hateth me
His folly Helena is no fault of mine
None but your beauty would that fault were mine
Take comfort he no more shall see my face
Lysander and myself will fly this place
Before the time I did Lysander see
Seemd Athens as a paradise to me
O then what graces in my love do dwell
That he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell
Helen to you our minds we will unfold
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
A time that lovers flights doth still conceal
Through Athens gates have we devised to steal
And in the wood where often you and I
Upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
There my Lysander and myself shall meet
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
To seek new friends and stranger companies
Farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius
Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight
From lovers food till morrow deep midnight
I will my Hermia
Exit HERMIA
Helena adieu
As you on him Demetrius dote on you
Exit
How happy some oer other some can be
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she
But what of that Demetrius thinks not so
He will not know what all but he do know
And as he errs doting on Hermias eyes
So I admiring of his qualities
Things base and vile folding no quantity
Love can transpose to form and dignity
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
And therefore is wingd Cupid painted blind
Nor hath Loves mind of any judgement taste
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
And therefore is Love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear
So the boy Love is perjured every where
For ere Demetrius lookd on Hermias eyne
He haild down oaths that he was only mine
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
So he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt
I will go tell him of fair Hermias flight
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
Pursue her and for this intelligence
If I have thanks it is a dear expense
But herein mean I to enrich my pain
To have his sight thither and back again
Exit
Enter QUINCE SNUG BOTTOM FLUTE SNOUT and STARVELING
Is all our company here
You were best to call them generally man by man
according to the scrip
Here is the scroll of every mans name which is
thought fit through all Athens to play in our
interlude before the duke and the duchess on his
weddingday at night
First good Peter Quince say what the play treats
to a point
Marry our play is The most lamentable comedy and
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby
A very good piece of work I assure you and a
merry Now good Peter Quince call forth your
Answer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaver
Ready Name what part I am for and proceed
You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus
What is Pyramus a lover or a tyrant
A lover that kills himself most gallant for love
That will ask some tears in the true performing of
it if I do it let the audience look to their
eyes I will move storms I will condole in some
measure To the rest yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part to
tear a cat in to make all split
The raging rocks
And shivering shocks
Shall break the locks
Of prison gates
And Phibbus car
Shall shine from far
And make and mar
The foolish Fates
This was lofty Now name the rest of the players
This is Ercles vein a tyrants vein a lover is
more condoling
Francis Flute the bellowsmender
Here Peter Quince
Flute you must take Thisby on you
What is Thisby a wandering knight
It is the lady that Pyramus must love
Nay faith let me not play a woman I have a beard coming
Thats all one you shall play it in a mask and
you may speak as small as you will
An I may hide my face let me play Thisby too Ill
speak in a monstrous little voice Thisne
Thisne Ah Pyramus lover dear thy Thisby dear
and lady dear
No no you must play Pyramus and Flute you Thisby
Well proceed
Robin Starveling the tailor
Here Peter Quince
Robin Starveling you must play Thisbys mother
Tom Snout the tinker

You Pyramus father myself Thisbys father
Snug the joiner you the lions part and I
hope here is a play fitted
Have you the lions part written pray you if it
be give it me for I am slow of study
You may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring
Let me play the lion too I will roar that I will
do any mans heart good to hear me I will roar
that I will make the duke say Let him roar again
let him roar again
An you should do it too terribly you would fright
the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek
and that were enough to hang us all
That would hang us every mothers son
I grant you friends if that you should fright the
ladies out of their wits they would have no more
discretion but to hang us but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove I will roar you an twere any
nightingale
You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a
sweetfaced man a proper man as one shall see in a
summers day a most lovely gentlemanlike man
therefore you must needs play Pyramus
Well I will undertake it What beard were I best
to play it in
Why what you will
I will discharge it in either your strawcolour
beard your orangetawny beard your purpleingrain
beard or your Frenchcrowncolour beard your
perfect yellow
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all and
then you will play barefaced But masters here
are your parts and I am to entreat you request
you and desire you to con them by tomorrow night
and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the
town by moonlight there will we rehearse for if
we meet in the city we shall be dogged with
company and our devices known In the meantime I
will draw a bill of properties such as our play
wants I pray you fail me not
We will meet and there we may rehearse most
At the dukes oak we meet
Enough hold or cut bowstrings
Exeunt
Enter from opposite sides a Fairy and PUCK
How now spirit whither wander you
Over hill over dale
Thorough bush thorough brier
Over park over pale
Thorough flood thorough fire
I do wander everywhere
Swifter than the moons sphere
And I serve the fairy queen
To dew her orbs upon the green
The cowslips tall her pensioners be
In their gold coats spots you see
Those be rubies fairy favours
In those freckles live their savours
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear
Farewell thou lob of spirits Ill be gone
Our queen and all our elves come here anon
The king doth keep his revels here tonight
Take heed the queen come not within his sight
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king
She never had so sweet a changeling
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train to trace the forests wild
But she perforce withholds the loved boy
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
And now they never meet in grove or green
By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
But they do square that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorncups and hide them there
Either I mistake your shape and making quite
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
Calld Robin Goodfellow are not you he
That frights the maidens of the villagery
Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm
Mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck
You do their work and they shall have good luck
Are not you he
Thou speakst aright
I am that merry wanderer of the night
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and beanfed horse beguile
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal
And sometime lurk I in a gossips bowl
In very likeness of a roasted crab
And when she drinks against her lips I bob
And on her witherd dewlap pour the ale
The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
Sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me
Then slip I from her bum down topples she
And tailor cries and falls into a cough
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there
But room fairy here comes Oberon
And here my mistress Would that he were gone
Enter from one side OBERON with his train from the other TITANIA with hers
Ill met by moonlight proud Titania
What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence
I have forsworn his bed and company
Tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord
Then I must be thy lady but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land
And in the shape of Corin sat all day
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
To amorous Phillida Why art thou here
Come from the farthest Steppe of India
But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
Your buskind mistress and your warrior love
To Theseus must be wedded and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity
How canst thou thus for shame Titania
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigenia whom he ravished
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith
With Ariadne and Antiopa
These are the forgeries of jealousy
And never since the middle summers spring
Met we on hill in dale forest or mead
By paved fountain or by rushy brook
Or in the beached margent of the sea
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
But with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport
Therefore the winds piping to us in vain
As in revenge have suckd up from the sea
Contagious fogs which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents
The ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain
The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard
The fold stands empty in the drowned field
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock
The nine mens morris is filld up with mud
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable
The human mortals want their winter here
No night is now with hymn or carol blest
Therefore the moon the governess of floods
Pale in her anger washes all the air
That rheumatic diseases do abound
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
And on old Hiems thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is as in mockery set the spring the summer
The childing autumn angry winter change
Their wonted liveries and the mazed world
By their increase now knows not which is which
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate from our dissension
We are their parents and original
Do you amend it then it lies in you
Why should Titania cross her Oberon
I do but beg a little changeling boy
To be my henchman
Set your heart at rest
The fairy land buys not the child of me
His mother was a votaress of my order
And in the spiced Indian air by night
Full often hath she gossipd by my side
And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands
Marking the embarked traders on the flood
When we have laughd to see the sails conceive
And grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
Which she with pretty and with swimming gait
Followingher womb then rich with my young squire
Would imitate and sail upon the land
To fetch me trifles and return again
As from a voyage rich with merchandise
But she being mortal of that boy did die
And for her sake do I rear up her boy
And for her sake I will not part with him
How long within this wood intend you stay
Perchance till after Theseus weddingday
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels go with us
If not shun me and I will spare your haunts
Give me that boy and I will go with thee
Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away
We shall chide downright if I longer stay
Exit TITANIA with her train
Well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury
My gentle Puck come hither Thou rememberest
Since once I sat upon a promontory
And heard a mermaid on a dolphins back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
To hear the seamaids music
I remember
That very time I saw but thou couldst not
Flying between the cold moon and the earth
Cupid all armd a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal throned by the west
And loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft
Quenchd in the chaste beams of the watery moon
And the imperial votaress passed on
In maiden meditation fancyfree
Yet markd I where the bolt of Cupid fell
It fell upon a little western flower
Before milkwhite now purple with loves wound
And maidens call it loveinidleness
Fetch me that flower the herb I shewd thee once
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees
Fetch me this herb and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league
Ill put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes
Exit
Having once this juice
Ill watch Titania when she is asleep
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes
The next thing then she waking looks upon
Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
On meddling monkey or on busy ape
She shall pursue it with the soul of love
And ere I take this charm from off her sight
As I can take it with another herb
Ill make her render up her page to me
But who comes here I am invisible
And I will overhear their conference
Enter DEMETRIUS HELENA following him
I love thee not therefore pursue me not
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia
The one Ill slay the other slayeth me
Thou toldst me they were stolen unto this wood
And here am I and wode within this wood
Because I cannot meet my Hermia
Hence get thee gone and follow me no more
You draw me you hardhearted adamant
But yet you draw not iron for my heart
Is true as steel leave you your power to draw
And I shall have no power to follow you
Do I entice you do I speak you fair
Or rather do I not in plainest truth
Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you
And even for that do I love you the more
I am your spaniel and Demetrius
The more you beat me I will fawn on you
Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
Neglect me lose me only give me leave
Unworthy as I am to follow you
What worser place can I beg in your love
And yet a place of high respect with me
Than to be used as you use your dog
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
For I am sick when I do look on thee
And I am sick when I look not on you
You do impeach your modesty too much
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity
Your virtue is my privilege for that
It is not night when I do see your face
Therefore I think I am not in the night
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
For you in my respect are all the world
Then how can it be said I am alone
When all the world is here to look on me
Ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
The wildest hath not such a heart as you
Run when you will the story shall be changed
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase
The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
When cowardice pursues and valour flies
I will not stay thy questions let me go
Or if thou follow me do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood
Ay in the temple in the town the field
You do me mischief Fie Demetrius
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
We cannot fight for love as men may do
We should be wood and were not made to woo
Exit DEMETRIUS
Ill follow thee and make a heaven of hell
To die upon the hand I love so well
Exit
Fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
Reenter PUCK
Hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer
Ay there it is
I pray thee give it me
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine
With sweet muskroses and with eglantine
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night
Lulld in these flowers with dances and delight
And there the snake throws her enamelld skin
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
And with the juice of this Ill streak her eyes
And make her full of hateful fantasies
Take thou some of it and seek through this grove
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on
Effect it with some care that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
Fear not my lord your servant shall do so
Exeunt
Enter TITANIA with her train
Come now a roundel and a fairy song
Then for the third part of a minute hence
Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds
Some war with reremice for their leathern wings
To make my small elves coats and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep
Then to your offices and let me rest
The Fairies sing
You spotted snakes with double tongue
Thorny hedgehogs be not seen
Newts and blindworms do no wrong
Come not near our fairy queen
Philomel with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby
Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
Never harm
Nor spell nor charm
Come our lovely lady nigh
So good night with lullaby
Weaving spiders come not here
Hence you longleggd spinners hence
Beetles black approach not near
Worm nor snail do no offence
Philomel with melody  and c
Hence away now all is well
One aloof stand sentinel
Exeunt Fairies TITANIA sleeps
Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIAs eyelids
What thou seest when thou dost wake
Do it for thy truelove take
Love and languish for his sake
Be it ounce or cat or bear
Pard or boar with bristled hair
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wakest it is thy dear
Wake when some vile thing is near
Exit
Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA
Fair love you faint with wandering in the wood
And to speak troth I have forgot our way
Well rest us Hermia if you think it good
And tarry for the comfort of the day
Be it so Lysander find you out a bed
For I upon this bank will rest my head
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both
One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
Nay good Lysander for my sake my dear
Lie further off yet do not lie so near
O take the sense sweet of my innocence
Love takes the meaning in loves conference
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit
So that but one heart we can make of it
Two bosoms interchained with an oath
So then two bosoms and a single troth
Then by your side no bedroom me deny
For lying so Hermia I do not lie
Lysander riddles very prettily
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
But gentle friend for love and courtesy
Lie further off in human modesty
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
So far be distant and good night sweet friend
Thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end
Amen amen to that fair prayer say I
And then end life when I end loyalty
Here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
With half that wish the wishers eyes be pressd
They sleep
Enter PUCK
Through the forest have I gone
But Athenian found I none
On whose eyes I might approve
This flowers force in stirring love
Night and silenceWho is here
Weeds of Athens he doth wear
This is he my master said
Despised the Athenian maid
And here the maiden sleeping sound
On the dank and dirty ground
Pretty soul she durst not lie
Near this lacklove this killcourtesy
Churl upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe
When thou wakest let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid
So awake when I am gone
For I must now to Oberon
Exit
Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA running
Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
O wilt thou darkling leave me do not so
Stay on thy peril I alone will go
Exit
O I am out of breath in this fond chase
The more my prayer the lesser is my grace
Happy is Hermia wheresoeer she lies
How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears
If so my eyes are oftener washd than hers
No no I am as ugly as a bear
For beasts that meet me run away for fear
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do as a monster fly my presence thus
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne
But who is here Lysander on the ground
Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound
Lysander if you live good sir awake
Awaking  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake
Transparent Helena Nature shows art
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
Where is Demetrius O how fit a word
Is that vile name to perish on my sword
Do not say so Lysander say not so
What though he love your Hermia Lord what though
Yet Hermia still loves you then be content
Content with Hermia No I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent
Not Hermia but Helena I love
Who will not change a raven for a dove
The will of man is by his reason swayd
And reason says you are the worthier maid
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I being young till now ripe not to reason
And touching now the point of human skill
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
And leads me to your eyes where I oerlook
Loves stories written in loves richest book
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn
Ist not enough ist not enough young man
That I did never no nor never can
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius eye
But you must flout my insufficiency
Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
In such disdainful manner me to woo
But fare you well perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness
O that a lady of one man refused
Should of another therefore be abused
Exit
She sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there
And never mayst thou come Lysander near
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings
Or as tie heresies that men do leave
Are hated most of those they did deceive
So thou my surfeit and my heresy
Of all be hated but the most of me
And all my powers address your love and might
To honour Helen and to be her knight
Exit
Awaking  Help me Lysander help me do thy best
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
Ay me for pity what a dream was here
Lysander look how I do quake with fear
Methought a serpent eat my heart away
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray

Peter Quince
What sayest thou bully Bottom
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please First Pyramus must
draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies
cannot abide How answer you that
Byr lakin a parlous fear
I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
Not a whit I have a device to make all well
Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to
say we will do no harm with our swords and that
Pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more
better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not
Pyramus but Bottom the weaver this will put them
out of fear
Well we will have such a prologue and it shall be
written in eight and six
No make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
I fear it I promise you
Masters you ought to consider with yourselves to
bring inGod shield usa lion among ladies is a
most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful
wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to
look to t
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
Nay you must name his name and half his face must
be seen through the lions neck and he himself
must speak through saying thus or to the same
defectLadiesor FairladiesI would wish
Youor I would request youor I would
entreat younot to fear not to tremble my life
for yours If you think I come hither as a lion it
were pity of my life no I am no such thing I am a
man as other men are and there indeed let him name
his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner
Well it shall be so But there is two hard things
that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for
you know Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play
A calendar a calendar look in the almanac find
out moonshine find out moonshine
Yes it doth shine that night
Why then may you leave a casement of the great
chamber window where we play open and the moon
may shine in at the casement
Ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to
present the person of Moonshine Then there is
another thing we must have a wall in the great
chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did
talk through the chink of a wall
You can never bring in a wall What say you Bottom
Some man or other must present Wall and let him
have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast
about him to signify wall and let him hold his
fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus
and Thisby whisper
If that may be then all is well Come sit  down
every mothers son and rehearse your parts
Pyramus you begin when you have spoken your
speech enter into that brake and so every one
according to his cue
Enter PUCK behind
What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here
So near the cradle of the fairy queen
What a play toward Ill be an auditor

Odours odours

So hath thy breath my dearest Thisby dear
But hark a voice stay thou but here awhile
And by and by I will to thee appear
Exit
A stranger Pyramus than eer played here
Exit
Must I speak now
Ay marry must you for you must understand he goes
but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again
Most radiant Pyramus most lilywhite of hue
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire
Ill meet thee Pyramus at Ninnys tomb
Ninus tomb man why you must not speak that
yet that you answer to Pyramus you speak all your
part at once cues and all Pyramus enter your cue
is past it is never tire

Exit
I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me
to fright me if they could But I will not stir
from this place do what they can I will walk up
and down here and I will sing that they shall hear
I am not afraid
Sings
The ousel cock so black of hue
With orangetawny bill
The throstle with his note so true
The wren with little quill
Awaking  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed
Sings
The finch the sparrow and the lark
The plainsong cuckoo gray
Whose note full many a man doth mark
And dares not answer nay
for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish
a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry
cuckoo never so
I pray thee gentle mortal sing again
Mine ear is much enamourd of thy note
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
And thy fair virtues force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say to swear I love thee
Methinks mistress you should have little reason
for that and yet to say the truth reason and
love keep little company together nowadays the
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends Nay I can gleek upon occasion
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
Not so neither but if I had wit enough to get out
of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turn
Out of this wood do not desire to go
Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
I am a spirit of no common rate
The summer still doth tend upon my state
And I do love thee therefore go with me
Ill give thee fairies to attend on thee
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go

Ready

And I
Where shall we go
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries
With purple grapes green figs and mulberries
The honeybags steal from the humblebees
And for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glowworms eyes
To have my love to bed and to arise
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
Nod to him elves and do him courtesies
Hail mortal

And when she weeps weeps every little flower
Lamenting some enforced chastity

Exeunt
Enter OBERON
I wonder if Titania be awaked
Then what it was that next came in her eye
Which she must dote on in extremity
Enter PUCK
Here comes my messenger
How now mad spirit
What nightrule now about this haunted grove
My mistress with a monster is in love
Near to her close and consecrated bower
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour
A crew of patches rude mechanicals
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus nuptialday
The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
Who Pyramus presented in their sport
When I did him at this advantage take
An asss nole I fixed on his head
Anon his Thisbe must be answered
And forth my mimic comes When they him spy
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
Or russetpated choughs many in sort
Rising and cawing at the guns report
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
So at his sight away his fellows fly
And at our stamp here oer and oer one falls
He murder cries and help from Athens calls
Their sense thus weak lost with their fears
thus strong
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
Some sleeves some hats from yielders all
things catch
And left sweet Pyramus translated there
When in that moment so it came to pass
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass
This falls out better than I could devise
But hast thou yet latchd the Athenians eyes
With the lovejuice as I did bid thee do
I took him sleepingthat is finishd too
And the Athenian woman by his side
That when he waked of force she must be eyed
Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS
Stand close this is the same Athenian
This is the woman but not this the man
O why rebuke you him that loves you so
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
Now I but chide but I should use thee worse
For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep
Being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep
And kill me too
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia Ill believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brothers noontide with Antipodes
It cannot be but thou hast murderd him
So should a murderer look so dead so grim
So should the murderd look and so should I
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere
Whats this to my Lysander where is he
Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds
Out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds
Of maidens patience Hast thou slain him then
Henceforth be never numberd among men
O once tell true tell true even for my sake
Durst thou have lookd upon him being awake
And hast thou killd him sleeping O brave touch
Could not a worm an adder do so much
An adder did it for with doubler tongue
Than thine thou serpent never adder stung
You spend your passion on a misprised mood
I am not guilty of Lysanders blood
Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell
I pray thee tell me then that he is well
An if I could what should I get therefore
A privilege never to see me more
And from thy hated presence part I so
See me no more whether he be dead or no
Exit
There is no following her in this fierce vein
Here therefore for a while I will remain
So sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
Which now in some slight measure it will pay
If for his tender here I make some stay
Lies down and sleeps
What hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
And laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turnd and not a false turnd true
Then fate oerrules that one man holding troth
A million fail confounding oath on oath
About the wood go swifter than the wind
And Helena of Athens look thou find
All fancysick she is and pale of cheer
With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
By some illusion see thou bring her here
Ill charm his eyes against she do appear
I go I go look how I go
Swifter than arrow from the Tartars bow
Exit
Flower of this purple dye
Hit with Cupids archery
Sink in apple of his eye
When his love he doth espy
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky
When thou wakest if she be by
Beg of her for remedy
Reenter PUCK
Captain of our fairy band
Helena is here at hand
And the youth mistook by me
Pleading for a lovers fee
Shall we their fond pageant see
Lord what fools these mortals be
Stand aside the noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake
Then will two at once woo one
That must needs be sport alone
And those things do best please me
That befal preposterously
Enter LYSANDER and HELENA
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn
Scorn and derision never come in tears
Look when I vow I weep and vows so born
In their nativity all truth appears
How can these things in me seem scorn to you
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
You do advance your cunning more and more
When truth kills truth O devilishholy fray
These vows are Hermias will you give her oer
Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
Your vows to her and me put in two scales
Will even weigh and both as light as tales
I had no judgment when to her I swore
Nor none in my mind now you give her oer
Demetrius loves her and he loves not you
Awaking  O Helena goddess nymph perfect divine
To what my love shall I compare thine eyne
Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show
Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
That pure congealed white high Taurus snow
Fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
When thou holdst up thy hand O let me kiss
This princess of pure white this seal of bliss
O spite O hell I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment
If you we re civil and knew courtesy
You would not do me thus much injury
Can you not hate me as I know you do
But you must join in souls to mock me too
If you were men as men you are in show
You would not use a gentle lady so
To vow and swear and superpraise my parts
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts
You both are rivals and love Hermia
And now both rivals to mock Helena
A trim exploit a manly enterprise
To conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes
With your derision none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin and extort
A poor souls patience all to make you sport
You are unkind Demetrius be not so
For you love Hermia this you know I know
And here with all good will with all my heart
In Hermias love I yield you up my part
And yours of Helena to me bequeath
Whom I do love and will do till my death
Never did mockers waste more idle breath
Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none
If eer I loved her all that love is gone
My heart to her but as guestwise sojournd
And now to Helen is it home returnd
There to remain
Helen it is not so
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know
Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
Reenter HERMIA
Dark night that from the eye his function takes
The ear more quick of apprehension makes
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
It pays the hearing double recompense
Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found
Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go
What love could press Lysander from my side
Lysanders love that would not let him bide
Fair Helena who more engilds the night
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light
Why seekst thou me could not this make thee know
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so
You speak not as you think it cannot be
Lo she is one of this confederacy
Now I perceive they have conjoind all three
To fashion this false sport in spite of me
Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid
Have you conspired have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision
Is all the counsel that we two have shared
The sisters vows the hours that we have spent
When we have chid the hastyfooted time
For parting usO is it all forgot
All schooldays friendship childhood innocence
We Hermia like two artificial gods
Have with our needles created both one flower
Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
Both warbling of one song both in one key
As if our hands our sides voices and minds
Had been incorporate So we grow together
Like to a double cherry seeming parted
But yet an union in partition
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem
So with two seeming bodies but one heart
Two of the first like coats in heraldry
Due but to one and crowned with one crest
And will you rent our ancient love asunder
To join with men in scorning your poor friend
It is not friendly tis not maidenly
Our sex as well as I may chide you for it
Though I alone do feel the injury
I am amazed at your passionate words
I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
Have you not set Lysander as in scorn
To follow me and praise my eyes and face
And made your other love Demetrius
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot
To call me goddess nymph divine and rare
Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love so rich within his soul
And tender me forsooth affection
But by your setting on by your consent
What thought I be not so in grace as you
So hung upon with love so fortunate
But miserable most to love unloved
This you should pity rather than despise
I understand not what you mean by this
Ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back
Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
This sport well carried shall be chronicled
If you have any pity grace or manners
You would not make me such an argument
But fare ye well tis partly my own fault
Which death or absence soon shall remedy
Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse
My love my life my soul fair Helena
O excellent
Sweet do not scorn her so
If she cannot entreat I can compel
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
Helen I love thee by my life I do
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
To prove him false that says I love thee not
I say I love thee more than he can do
If thou say so withdraw and prove it too
Quick come
Lysander whereto tends all this
Away you Ethiope
No no hell         
Seem to break loose take on as you would follow
But yet come not you are a tame man go
Hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent
Why are you grown so rude what change is this
Sweet love
Thy love out tawny Tartar out
Out loathed medicine hated potion hence
Do you not jest
Yes sooth and so do you
Demetrius I will keep my word with thee
I would I had your bond for I perceive
A weak bond holds you Ill not trust your word
What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead
Although I hate her Ill not harm her so
What can you do me greater harm than hate
Hate me wherefore O me what news my love
Am not I Hermia are not you Lysander
I am as fair now as I was erewhile
Since night you loved me yet since night you left
me
Why then you left meO the gods forbid
In earnest shall I say
Ay by my life
And never did desire to see thee more
Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
Be certain nothing truer tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena
O me you juggler you cankerblossom
You thief of love what have you come by night
And stolen my loves heart from him
Fine ifaith
Have you no modesty no maiden shame
No touch of bashfulness What will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue
Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
Puppet why so ay that way goes the game
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures she hath urged her height
And with her personage her tall personage
Her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him
And are you grown so high in his esteem
Because I am so dwarfish and so low
How low am I thou painted maypole speak
How low am I I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
I pray you though you mock me gentlemen
Let her not hurt me I was never curst
I have no gift at all in shrewishness
I am a right maid for my cowardice
Let her not strike me You perhaps may think
Because she is something lower than myself
That I can match her
Lower hark again
Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me
I evermore did love you Hermia
Did ever keep your counsels never wrongd you
Save that in love unto Demetrius
I told him of your stealth unto this wood
He followd you for love I followd him
But he hath chid me hence and threatend me
To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
And now so you will let me quiet go
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further let me go
You see how simple and how fond I am
Why get you gone who ist that hinders you
A foolish heart that I leave here behind
What with Lysander
With Demetrius
Be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena
No sir she shall not though you take her part
O when shes angry she is keen and shrewd
She was a vixen when she went to school
And though she be but little she is fierce
Little again nothing but low and little
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus
Let me come to her
Get you gone you dwarf
You minimus of hindering knotgrass made
You bead you acorn
You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services
Let her alone speak not of Helena
Take not her part for if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her
Thou shalt aby it
Now she holds me not
Now follow if thou darest to try whose right
Of thine or mine is most in Helena
Follow nay Ill go with thee cheek by jole
Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS
You mistress all this coil is long of you
Nay go not back
I will not trust you I
Nor longer stay in your curst company
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
My legs are longer though to run away
Exit
I am amazed and know not what to say
Exit
This is thy negligence still thou mistakest
Or else committst thy knaveries wilfully
Believe me king of shadows I mistook
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garment be had on
And so far blameless proves my enterprise
That I have nointed an Athenians eyes
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
Hie therefore Robin overcast the night
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within anothers way
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius
And from each other look thou lead them thus
Till oer their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
Then crush this herb into Lysanders eye
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property
To take from thence all error with his might
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
When they next wake all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
With league whose date till death shall never end
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ
Ill to my queen and beg her Indian boy
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monsters view and all things shall be peace
My fairy lord this must be done with haste
For nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
And yonder shines Auroras harbinger
At whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
Troop home to churchyards damned spirits all
That in crossways and floods have burial
Already to their wormy beds are gone
For fear lest day should look their shames upon
They willfully themselves exile from light
And must for aye consort with blackbrowd night
But we are spirits of another sort
I with the mornings love have oft made sport
And like a forester the groves may tread
Even till the eastern gate all fieryred
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
But notwithstanding haste make no delay
We may effect this business yet ere day
Exit
Up and down up and down
I will lead them up and down
I am feard in field and town
Goblin lead them up and down
Here comes one
Reenter LYSANDER
Where art thou proud Demetrius speak thou now
Here villain drawn and ready Where art thou
I will be with thee straight
Follow me then
To plainer ground
Exit LYSANDER as following the voice
Reenter DEMETRIUS
Lysander speak again
Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head
Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
Telling the bushes that thou lookst for wars
And wilt not come Come recreant come thou child
Ill whip thee with a rod he is defiled
That draws a sword on thee
Yea art thou there
Follow my voice well try no manhood here
Exeunt
Reenter LYSANDER
He goes before me and still dares me on
When I come where he calls then he is gone
The villain is much lighterheeld than I
I followd fast but faster he did fly
That fallen am I in dark uneven way
And here will rest me
Lies down
Come thou gentle day
For if but once thou show me thy grey light
Ill find Demetrius and revenge this spite
Sleeps
Reenter PUCK and DEMETRIUS
Ho ho ho Coward why comest thou not
Abide me if thou darest for well I wot
Thou runnst before me shifting every place
And darest not stand nor look me in the face
Where art thou now
Come hither I am here
Nay then thou mockst me Thou shalt buy this dear
If ever I thy face by daylight see
Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed
By days approach look to be visited
Lies down and sleeps
Reenter HELENA
O weary night O long and tedious night
Abate thy hour Shine comforts from the east
That I may back to Athens by daylight
From these that my poor company detest
And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrows eye
Steal me awhile from mine own company
Lies down and sleeps
Yet but three Come one more
Two of both kinds make up four
Here she comes curst and sad
Cupid is a knavish lad
Thus to make poor females mad
Reenter HERMIA
Never so weary never so in woe
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
I can no further crawl no further go
My legs can keep no pace with my desires
Here will I rest me till the break of day
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
Lies down and sleeps
On the ground
Sleep sound
Ill apply
To your eye
Gentle lover remedy
Squeezing the juice on LYSANDERs eyes
When thou wakest
Thou takest
True delight
In the sight
Of thy former ladys eye
And the country proverb known
That every man should take his own
In your waking shall be shown
Jack shall have Jill
Nought shall go ill
The man shall have his mare again and all shall be well

The squirrels hoard and fetch thee new nuts

Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms

Enter PUCK
Advancing  Welcome good Robin
Seest thou this sweet sight
Her dotage now I do begin to pity
For meeting her of late behind the wood
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool
I did upbraid her and fall out with her
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
And that same dew which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
Stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
And she in mild terms beggd my patience
I then did ask of her her changeling child
Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land
And now I have the boy I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes
And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain
That he awaking when the other do
May all to Athens back again repair
And think no more of this nights accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream
But first I will release the fairy queen
Be as thou wast wont to be
See as thou wast wont to see
Dians bud oer Cupids flower
Hath such force and blessed power
Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen
My Oberon what visions have I seen
Methought I was enamourd of an ass
There lies your love
How came these things to pass
O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
Silence awhile Robin take off this head
Titania music call and strike more dead
Than common sleep of all these five the sense
Music ho music such as charmeth sleep
Music still
Now when thou wakest with thine
own fools eyes peep
Sound music Come my queen take hands with me
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
Now thou and I are new in amity
And will tomorrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly
And bless it to all fair prosperity
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded with Theseus all in jollity
Fairy king attend and mark
I do hear the morning lark
Then my queen in silence sad
Trip we after the nights shade
We the globe can compass soon
Swifter than the wandering moon
Come my lord and in our flight
Tell me how it came this night
That I sleeping here was found
With these mortals on the ground
Exeunt
Horns winded within
Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA EGEUS and train
Go one of you find out the forester
For now our observation is performd
And since we have the vaward of the day
My love shall hear the music of my hounds
Uncouple in the western valley let them go
Dispatch I say and find the forester
Exit an Attendant
We will fair queen up to the mountains top
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
When in a wood of Crete they bayd the bear
With hounds of Sparta never did I hear
Such gallant chiding for besides the groves
The skies the fountains every region near
Seemd all one mutual cry I never heard
So musical a discord such sweet thunder
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind
So flewd so sanded and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew
Crookkneed and dewlappd like Thessalian bulls
Slow in pursuit but matchd in mouth like bells
Each under each A cry more tuneable
Was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn
In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly
Judge when you hear But soft what nymphs are these
My lord this is my daughter here asleep
And this Lysander this Demetrius is
This Helena old Nedars Helena
I wonder of their being here together
No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May and hearing our intent
Came here in grace our solemnity
But speak Egeus is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice
It is my lord
Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
Horns and shout within LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HELENA and HERMIA wake and start up
Good morrow friends Saint Valentine is past
Begin these woodbirds but to couple now
Pardon my lord
I pray you all stand up
I know you two are rival enemies
How comes this gentle concord in the world
That hatred is so far from jealousy
To sleep by hate and fear no enmity
My lord I shall reply amazedly
Half sleep half waking but as yet I swear
I cannot truly say how I came here
But as I thinkfor truly would I speak
And now do I bethink me so it is
I came with Hermia hither our intent
Was to be gone from Athens where we might
Without the peril of the Athenian law
Enough enough my lord you have enough
I beg the law the law upon his head
They would have stolen away they would Demetrius
Thereby to have defeated you and me
You of your wife and me of my consent
Of my consent that she should be your wife
My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth
Of this their purpose hither to this wood
And I in fury hither followd them
Fair Helena in fancy following me
But my good lord I wot not by what power
But by some power it ismy love to Hermia
Melted as the snow seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon
And all the faith the virtue of my heart
The object and the pleasure of mine eye
Is only Helena To her my lord
Was I betrothd ere I saw Hermia
But like in sickness did I loathe this food
But as in health come to my natural taste
Now I do wish it love it long for it
And will for evermore be true to it
Fair lovers you are fortunately met
Of this discourse we more will hear anon
Egeus I will overbear your will
For in the temple by and by with us
These couples shall eternally be knit
And for the morning now is something worn
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside
Away with us to Athens three and three
Well hold a feast in great solemnity
Come Hippolyta
Exeunt THESEUS HIPPOLYTA EGEUS and train
These things seem small and undistinguishable
Methinks I see these things with parted eye
When every thing seems double
So methinks
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel
Mine own and not mine own
Are you sure
That we are awake It seems to me
That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think
The duke was here and bid us follow him
Yea and my father
And Hippolyta
And he did bid us follow to the temple
Why then we are awake lets follow him
And by the way let us recount our dreams
Exeunt
Awaking  When my cue comes call me and I will
answer my next is Most fair Pyramus Heighho
Peter Quince Flute the bellowsmender Snout
the tinker Starveling Gods my life stolen
hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare
vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to
say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go
about to expound this dream Methought I wasthere
is no man can tell what Methought I wasand
methought I hadbut man is but a patched fool if
he will offer to say what methought I had The eye
of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not
seen mans hand is not able to taste his tongue
to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream
was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
this dream it shall be called Bottoms Dream
because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the
latter end of a play before the duke
peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall
sing it at her death
Exit
Enter QUINCE FLUTE SNOUT and STARVELING
Have you sent to Bottoms house  is he come home yet
He cannot be heard of Out of doubt he is
transported
If he come not then the play is marred it goes
not forward doth it
It is not possible you have not a man in all
Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he
No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
man in Athens
Yea and the best person too and he is a very
paramour for a sweet voice
You must say paragon a paramour is God bless us
a thing of naught
Enter SNUG
Masters the duke is coming from the temple and
there is two or three lords and ladies more married
if our sport had gone forward we had all been made
men
O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a
day during his life he could not have scaped
sixpence a day an the duke had not given him
sixpence a day for playing Pyramus Ill be hanged
he would have deserved it sixpence a day in
Pyramus or nothing
Enter BOTTOM
Where are these lads where are these hearts
Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour
Masters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not
what for if I tell you I am no true Athenian I
will tell you every thing right as it fell out
Let us hear sweet Bottom
Not a word of me All that I will tell you is that
the duke hath dined Get your apparel together
good strings to your beards new ribbons to your
pumps meet presently at the palace every man look
oer his part for the short and the long is our
play is preferred In any case let Thisby have
clean linen and let not him that plays the lion
pair his nails for they shall hang out for the
nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I
do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet
comedy No more words away go away
Exeunt
Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE Lords and Attendants
Tis strange my Theseus that these
lovers speak of
More strange than true I never may believe
These antique fables nor these fairy toys
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains
Such shaping fantasies that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends
The lunatic the lover and the poet
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold
That is the madman the lover all as frantic
Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egypt
The poets eye in fine frenzy rolling
Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown the poets pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name
Such tricks hath strong imagination
That if it would but apprehend some joy
It comprehends some bringer of that joy
Or in the night imagining some fear
How easy is a bush supposed a bear
But all the story of the night told over
And all their minds transfigured so together
More witnesseth than fancys images
And grows to something of great constancy
But howsoever strange and admirable
Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
Enter LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HERMIA and HELENA
Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
Accompany your hearts
More than to us
Wait in your royal walks your board your bed
Come now what masques what dances shall we have
To wear away this long age of three hours
Between our aftersupper and bedtime
Where is our usual manager of mirth
What revels are in hand Is there no play
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour
Call Philostrate
Here mighty Theseus
Say what abridgement have you for this evening
What masque what music How shall we beguile
The lazy time if not with some delight
There is a brief how many sports are ripe
Make choice of which your highness will see first
Giving a paper
Reads  The battle with the Centaurs to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp
Well none of that that have I told my love
In glory of my kinsman Hercules
Reads
The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage
That is an old device and it was playd
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror
Reads
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
Of Learning late deceased in beggary
That is some satire keen and critical
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
Reads
And his love Thisbe very tragical mirth
Merry and tragical tedious and brief
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
How shall we find the concord of this discord
A play there is my lord some ten words long
Which is as brief as I have known a play
But by ten words my lord it is too long
Which makes it tedious for in all the play
There is not one word apt one player fitted
And tragical my noble lord it is
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself
Which when I saw rehearsed I must confess
Made mine eyes water but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed
What are they that do play it
Hardhanded men that work in Athens here
Which never labourd in their minds till now
And now have toild their unbreathed memories
With this same play against your nuptial
And we will hear it
No my noble lord
It is not for you I have heard it over
And it is nothing nothing in the world
Unless you can find sport in their intents
Extremely stretchd and connd with cruel pain
To do you service
I will hear that play
For never anything can be amiss
When simpleness and duty tender it
Go bring them in and take your places ladies
Exit PHILOSTRATE
I love not to see wretchedness oer charged
And duty in his service perishing
Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
He says they can do nothing in this kind
The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake
And what poor duty cannot do noble respect
Takes it in might not merit
Where I have come great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale
Make periods in the midst of sentences
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off
Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet
Out of this silence yet I pickd a welcome
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence
Love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
In least speak most to my capacity
Reenter PHILOSTRATE
So please your grace the Prologue is addressd
Let him approach
Flourish of trumpets
Enter QUINCE for the Prologue
If we offend it is with our good will
That you should think we come not to offend
But with good will To show our simple skill
That is the true beginning of our end
Consider then we come but in despite
We do not come as minding to contest you
Our true intent is All for your delight
We are not here That you should here repent you
You shall know all that you are like to know
This fellow doth not stand upon points
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows
not the stop A good moral my lord it is not
enough to speak but to speak true
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
on a recorder a sound but not in government
His speech was like a tangled chain nothing
impaired but all disordered Who is next
Enter Pyramus and Thisbe Wall Moonshine and Lion
Gentles perchance you wonder at this show
But wonder on till truth make all things plain
This man is Pyramus if you would know
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain
This man with lime and roughcast doth present
Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder
And through Walls chink poor souls they are content
To whisper At the which let no man wonder
This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus tomb there there to woo
This grisly beast which Lion hight by name
The trusty Thisby coming first by night
Did scare away or rather did affright
And as she fled her mantle she did fall
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall
And finds his trusty Thisbys mantle slain
Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
He bravely broachd is boiling bloody breast
And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
His dagger drew and died For all the rest
Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain
At large discourse while here they do remain
Exeunt Prologue Thisbe Lion and Moonshine
I wonder if the lion be to speak
No wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
In this same interlude it doth befall
That I one Snout by name present a wall
And such a wall as I would have you think
That had in it a crannied hole or chink
Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby
Did whisper often very secretly
This loam this roughcast and this stone doth show
That I am that same wall the truth is so
And this the cranny is right and sinister
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
discourse my lord
Enter Pyramus
Pyramus draws near the wall silence
O grimlookd night O night with hue so black
O night which ever art when day is not
O night O night alack alack alack
I fear my Thisbys promise is forgot
And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall
That standst between her fathers ground and mine
Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall
Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
Wall holds up his fingers
Thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this
But what see I No Thisby do I see
O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
The wall methinks being sensible should curse again
No in truth sir he should not Deceiving me
is Thisbys cue she is to enter now and I am to
spy her through the wall You shall see it will
fall pat as I told you Yonder she comes
Enter Thisbe
O wall full often hast thou heard my moans
For parting my fair Pyramus and me
My cherry lips have often kissd thy stones
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
I see a voice now will I to the chink
To spy an I can hear my Thisbys face Thisby
My love thou art my love I think
Think what thou wilt I am thy lovers grace
And like Limander am I trusty still
And I like Helen till the Fates me kill
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
As Shafalus to Procrus I to you
O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
I kiss the walls hole not your lips at all
Wilt thou at Ninnys tomb meet me straightway
Tide life tide death I come without delay
Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe
Thus have I Wall my part discharged so
And being done thus Wall away doth go
Exit
Now is the mural down between the two neighbours
No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard
The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst
are no worse if imagination amend them
It must be your imagination then and not theirs
If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves they may pass for excellent men Here
come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
Enter Lion and Moonshine
You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
May now perchance both quake and tremble here
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
Then know that I one Snug the joiner am
A lionfell nor else no lions dam
For if I should as lion come in strife
Into this place twere pity on my life
A very gentle beast of a good conscience
The very best at a beast my lord that eer I saw
This lion is a very fox for his valour
True and a goose for his discretion
Not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his
discretion and the fox carries the goose
His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour
for the goose carries not the fox It is well
leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present
He should have worn the horns on his head
He is no crescent and his horns are
invisible within the circumference
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present
Myself the man i the moon do seem to be
This is the greatest error of all the rest the man
should be put into the lanthorn How is it else the
man i the moon
He dares not come there for the candle for you
see it is already in snuff
I am aweary of this moon would he would change
It appears by his small light of discretion that
he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all
reason we must stay the time
Proceed Moon
All that I have to say is to tell you that the
lanthorn is the moon I the man in the moon this
thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog
Why all these should be in the lanthorn for all
these are in the moon But silence here comes Thisbe
Enter Thisbe
This is old Ninnys tomb Where is my love
Roaring  Oh
Thisbe runs off
Well roared Lion
Well run Thisbe
Well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a
good grace
The Lion shakes Thisbes mantle and exit
Well moused Lion
And so the lion vanished
And then came Pyramus
Enter Pyramus
Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams
I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright
For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight
But stay O spite
But mark poor knight
What dreadful dole is here
Eyes do you see
How can it be
O dainty duck O dear
Thy mantle good
What staind with blood
Approach ye Furies fell
O Fates come come
Cut thread and thrum
Quail crush conclude and quell
This passion and the death of a dear friend would
go near to make a man look sad
Beshrew my heart but I pity the man
O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame
Since lion vile hath here deflowerd my dear
Which isno nowhich was the fairest dame
That lived that loved that liked that lookd
with cheer
Come tears confound
Out sword and wound
The pap of Pyramus
Ay that left pap
Where heart doth hop
Stabs himself
Thus die I thus thus thus
Now am I dead
Now am I fled
My soul is in the sky
Tongue lose thy light
Moon take thy flight
Exit Moonshine
Now die die die die die
Dies
No die but an ace for him for he is but one
Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and
prove an ass
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
back and finds her lover
She will find him by starlight Here she comes and
her passion ends the play
Reenter Thisbe
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
Pyramus I hope she will be brief
A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which
Thisbe is the better he for a man God warrant us
she for a woman God bless us
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
And thus she means videlicet
Asleep my love
What dead my dove
O Pyramus arise
Speak speak Quite dumb
Dead dead A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes
These My lips
This cherry nose
These yellow cowslip cheeks
Are gone are gone
Lovers make moan
His eyes were green as leeks
O Sisters Three
Come come to me
With hands as pale as milk
Lay them in gore
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk
Tongue not a word
Come trusty sword
Come blade my breast imbrue
Stabs herself
And farewell friends
Thus Thisby ends
Adieu adieu adieu
Dies
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
Ay and Wall too
Starting up  No assure you the wall is down that
parted their fathers Will it please you to see the
epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
of our company
No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no
excuse Never excuse for when the players are all
dead there needs none to be blamed Marry if he
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
in Thisbes garter it would have been a fine
tragedy and so it is truly and very notably
discharged But come your Bergomask let your
epilogue alone
A dance
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
Lovers to bed tis almost fairy time
I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
As much as we this night have overwatchd
This palpablegross play hath well beguiled
The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed
A fortnight hold we this solemnity
In nightly revels and new jollity
Exeunt
Enter PUCK
Now the hungry lion roars
And the wolf behowls the moon
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores
All with weary task fordone
Now the wasted brands do glow
Whilst the screechowl screeching loud
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide
Every one lets forth his sprite
In the churchway paths to glide
And we fairies that do run
By the triple Hecates team
From the presence of the sun
Following darkness like a dream
Now are frolic not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallowd house
I am sent with broom before
To sweep the dust behind the door
Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train
Through the house give gathering light
By the dead and drowsy fire
Every elf and fairy sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier
And this ditty after me
Sing and dance it trippingly
First rehearse your song by rote
To each word a warbling note
Hand in hand with fairy grace
Will we sing and bless this place
Song and dance
Now until the break of day
Through this house each fairy stray
To the best bridebed will we
Which by us shall blessed be
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be
And the blots of Natures hand
Shall not in their issue stand
Never mole hare lip nor scar
Nor mark prodigious such as are
Despised in nativity
Shall upon their children be
With this fielddew consecrate
Every fairy take his gait
And each several chamber bless
Through this palace with sweet peace
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest
Trip away make no stay
Meet me all by break of day
Exeunt OBERON TITANIA and train
If we shadows have offended
Think but this and all is mended
That you have but slumberd here
While these visions did appear
And this weak and idle theme
No more yielding but a dream
Gentles do not reprehend
if you pardon we will mend
And as I am an honest Puck
If we have unearned luck
Now to scape the serpents tongue
We will make amends ere long
Else the Puck a liar call
So good night unto you all
Give me your hands if we be friends
And Robin shall restore amends
Enter LEONATO HERO and BEATRICE with a Messenger
I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
comes this night to Messina
He is very near by this he was not three leagues off
when I left him
But few of any sort and none of name
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
home full numbers I find here that Don Peter hath
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio
Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
Don Pedro he hath borne himself beyond the
promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb
the feats of a lion he hath indeed better
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
tell you how
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
glad of it
I have already delivered him letters and there
appears much joy in him even so much that joy could
not show itself modest enough without a badge of
bitterness
Did he break out into tears
In great measure
A kind overflow of kindness there are no faces
truer than those that are so washed How much
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping
I pray you is Signior Mountanto returned from the
wars or no
I know none of that name lady there was none such
in the army of any sort
What is he that you ask for niece
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua
O hes returned and as pleasant as ever he was
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
Cupid at the flight and my uncles fool reading
the challenge subscribed for Cupid and challenged
him at the birdbolt I pray you how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars But how many hath
he killed for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing
Faith niece you tax Signior Benedick too much
but hell be meet with you I doubt it not
He hath done good service lady in these wars
You had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it
he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an
excellent stomach
And a good soldier too lady
And a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord
A lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all
honourable virtues
It is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man
but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal
You must not sir mistake my niece There is a
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her
they never meet but theres a skirmish of wit
between them
Alas he gets nothing by that In our last
conflict four of his five wits went halting off and
now is the whole man governed with one so that if
he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him
bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left
to be known a reasonable creature Who is his
companion now He hath every month a new sworn brother
Ist possible
Very easily possible he wears his faith but as
the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the
next block
I see lady the gentleman is not in your books
No an he were I would burn my study But I pray
you who is his companion Is there no young
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio
O Lord he will hang upon him like a disease he
is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker
runs presently mad God help the noble Claudio if
he have caught the Benedick it will cost him a
thousand pound ere a be cured
I will hold friends with you lady
Do good friend
You will never run mad niece
No not till a hot January
Don Pedro is approached
Enter DON PEDRO DON JOHN CLAUDIO BENEDICK and BALTHASAR
Good Signior Leonato you are come to meet your
trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid
cost and you encounter it
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
your grace for trouble being gone comfort should
remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides
and happiness takes his leave
You embrace your charge too willingly I think this
is your daughter
Her mother hath many times told me so
Were you in doubt sir that you asked her
Signior Benedick no for then were you a child
You have it full Benedick we may guess by this
what you are being a man Truly the lady fathers
herself Be happy lady for you are like an
honourable father
If Signior Leonato be her father she would not
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina as
like him as she is
I wonder that you will still be talking Signior
Benedick nobody marks you
What my dear Lady Disdain are you yet living
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come
in her presence
Then is courtesy a turncoat But it is certain I
am loved of all ladies only you excepted and I
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
heart for truly I love none
A dear happiness to women they would else have
been troubled with a pernicious suitor I thank God
and my cold blood I am of your humour for that I
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
swear he loves me
God keep your ladyship still in that mind so some
gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
scratched face
Scratching could not make it worse an twere such
a face as yours were
Well you are a rare parrotteacher
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and
so good a continuer But keep your way i Gods
name I have done
You always end with a jades trick I know you of old
That is the sum of all Leonato Signior Claudio
and Signior Benedick my dear friend Leonato hath
invited you all I tell him we shall stay here at
the least a month and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer I dare swear he is no
hypocrite but prays from his heart
If you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn
To DON JOHN
Let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to
the prince your brother I owe you all duty
I thank you I am not of many words but I thank
you
Please it your grace lead on
Your hand Leonato we will go together
Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO
Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato
I noted her not but I looked on her
Is she not a modest young lady
Do you question me as an honest man should do for
my simple true judgment or would you have me speak
after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex
No I pray thee speak in sober judgment
Why i faith methinks shes too low for a high
praise too brown for a fair praise and too little
for a great praise only this commendation I can
afford her that were she other than she is she
were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I
do not like her
Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me
truly how thou likest her
Would you buy her that you inquire after her
Can the world buy such a jewel
Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this
with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack
to tell us Cupid is a good harefinder and Vulcan a
rare carpenter Come in what key shall a man take
you to go in the song
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
looked on
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
matter theres her cousin an she were not
possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty
as the first of May doth the last of December But I
hope you have no intent to turn husband have you
I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn the
contrary if Hero would be my wife
Ist come to this In faith hath not the world
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion
Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again
Go to i faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away
Sundays Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you
Reenter DON PEDRO
What secret hath held you here that you followed
not to Leonatos
I would your grace would constrain me to tell
I charge thee on thy allegiance
You hear Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb
man I would have you think so but on my
allegiance mark you this on my allegiance He is
in love With who now that is your graces part
Mark how short his answer isWith Hero Leonatos
short daughter
If this were so so were it uttered
Like the old tale my lord it is not so nor
twas not so but indeed God forbid it should be
so
If my passion change not shortly God forbid it
should be otherwise
Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
You speak this to fetch me in my lord
By my troth I speak my thought
And in faith my lord I spoke mine
And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine
That I love her I feel
That she is worthy I know
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
know how she should be worthy is the opinion that
fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
of beauty
And never could maintain his part but in the force
of his will
That a woman conceived me I thank her that she
brought me up I likewise give her most humble
thanks but that I will have a recheat winded in my
forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick
all women shall pardon me Because I will not do
them the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the
right to trust none and the fine is for the which
I may go the finer I will live a bachelor
I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love
With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord
not with love prove that ever I lose more blood
with love than I will get again with drinking pick
out mine eyes with a balladmakers pen and hang me
up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of
blind Cupid
Well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou
wilt prove a notable argument
If I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on
the shoulder and called Adam
Well as time shall try In time the savage bull
doth bear the yoke
The savage bull may but if ever the sensible
Benedick bear it pluck off the bulls horns and set
them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted
and in such great letters as they write Here is
good horse to hire let them signify under my sign
Here you may see Benedick the married man
If this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad
Nay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
Venice thou wilt quake for this shortly
I look for an earthquake too then
Well you temporize with the hours In the
meantime good Signior Benedick repair to
Leonatos commend me to him and tell him I will
not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made
great preparation
I have almost matter enough in me for such an
embassage and so I commit you
To the tuition of God From my house if I had it
The sixth of July Your loving friend Benedick
Nay mock not mock not The body of your
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and
the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere
you flout old ends any further examine your
conscience and so I leave you
Exit
My liege your highness now may do me good
My love is thine to teach teach it but how
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good
Hath Leonato any son my lord
No child but Hero shes his only heir
Dost thou affect her Claudio
O my lord
I lookd upon her with a soldiers eye
That liked but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love
But now I am returnd and that warthoughts
Have left their places vacant in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires
All prompting me how fair young Hero is
Saying I liked her ere I went to wars
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words
If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it
And I will break with her and with her father
And thou shalt have her Wast not to this end
That thou beganst to twist so fine a story
How sweetly you do minister to love
That know loves grief by his complexion
But lest my liking might too sudden seem
I would have salved it with a longer treatise
What need the bridge much broader than the flood
The fairest grant is the necessity
Look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest
And I will fit thee with the remedy
I know we shall have revelling tonight
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio
And in her bosom Ill unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale
Then after to her father will I break
And the conclusion is she shall be thine
Exeunt
Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO meeting
How now brother Where is my cousin your son
hath he provided this music
He is very busy about it But brother I can tell
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of
Are they good
As the event stamps them but they have a good
cover they show well outward The prince and Count
Claudio walking in a thickpleached alley in mine
orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
this night in a dance and if he found her
accordant he meant to take the present time by the
top and instantly break with you of it
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this
A good sharp fellow I will send for him and
question him yourself
No no we will hold it as a dream till it appear
itself but I will acquaint my daughter withal
that she may be the better prepared for an answer
if peradventure this be true Go you and tell her of it
Enter Attendants
Cousins you know what you have to do O I cry you
mercy friend go you with me and I will use your
skill Good cousin have a care this busy time
Exeunt
Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE
What the goodyear my lord why are you thus out
of measure sad
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds
therefore the sadness is without limit
You should hear reason
And when I have heard it what blessing brings it
If not a present remedy at least a patient
sufferance
I wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art
born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral
medicine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide
what I am I must be sad when I have cause and smile
at no mans jests eat when I have stomach and wait
for no mans leisure sleep when I am drowsy and
tend on no mans business laugh when I am merry and
claw no man in his humour
Yea but you must not make the full show of this
till you may do it without controlment You have of
late stood out against your brother and he hath
taen you newly into his grace where it is
impossible you should take true root but by the
fair weather that you make yourself it is needful
that you frame the season for your own harvest
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
his grace and it better fits my blood to be
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
love from any in this though I cannot be said to
be a flattering honest man it must not be denied
but I am a plaindealing villain I am trusted with
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I
have decreed not to sing in my cage If I had my
mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I would do
my liking in the meantime let me be that I am and
seek not to alter me
Can you make no use of your discontent
I make all use of it for I use it only
Who comes here
Enter BORACHIO
What news Borachio
I came yonder from a great supper the prince your
brother is royally entertained by Leonato and I
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness
Marry it is your brothers right hand
Who the most exquisite Claudio
Even he
A proper squire And who and who which way looks
he
Marry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato
A very forward Marchchick How came you to this
Being entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a
musty room comes me the prince and Claudio hand
in hand in sad conference I whipt me behind the
arras and there heard it agreed upon that the
prince should woo Hero for himself and having
obtained her give her to Count Claudio
Come come let us thither this may prove food to
my displeasure That young startup hath all the
glory of my overthrow if I can cross him any way I
bless myself every way You are both sure and will assist me
To the death my lord
Let us to the great supper their cheer is the
greater that I am subdued Would the cook were of
my mind Shall we go prove whats to be done
Well wait upon your lordship
Exeunt
Enter LEONATO ANTONIO HERO BEATRICE and others
Was not Count John here at supper
I saw him not
How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see
him but I am heartburned an hour after
He is of a very melancholy disposition
He were an excellent man that were made just in the
midway between him and Benedick the one is too
like an image and says nothing and the other too
like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling
Then half Signior Benedicks tongue in Count Johns
mouth and half Count Johns melancholy in Signior
Benedicks face
With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money
enough in his purse such a man would win any woman
in the world if a could get her goodwill
By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a
husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
In faith shes too curst
Too curst is more than curst I shall lessen Gods
sending that way for it is said God sends a curst
cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none
So by being too curst God will send you no horns
Just if he send me no husband for the which
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
evening Lord I could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face I had rather lie in the woollen
You may light on a husband that hath no beard
What should I do with him dress him in my apparel
and make him my waitinggentlewoman He that hath a
beard is more than a youth and he that hath no
beard is less than a man and he that is more than
a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
man I am not for him therefore I will even take
sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his
apes into hell
Well then go you into hell
No but to the gate and there will the devil meet
me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and
say Get you to heaven Beatrice get you to
heaven heres no place for you maids so deliver
I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the
heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and
there live we as merry as the day is long
To HERO  Well niece I trust you will be ruled
by your father
Yes faith it is my cousins duty to make curtsy
and say Father as it please you But yet for all
that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else
make another curtsy and say Father as it please
me
Well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband
Not till God make men of some other metal than
earth Would it not grieve a woman to be
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
No uncle Ill none Adams sons are my brethren
and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred
Daughter remember what I told you if the prince
do solicit you in that kind you know your answer
The fault will be in the music cousin if you be
not wooed in good time if the prince be too
important tell him there is measure in every thing
and so dance out the answer For hear me Hero
wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig
a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot
and hasty like a Scotch jig and full as
fantastical the wedding mannerlymodest as a
measure full of state and ancientry and then comes
repentance and with his bad legs falls into the
cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave
Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly
I have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylight
The revellers are entering brother make good room
All put on their masks
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO BENEDICK BALTHASAR DON JOHN BORACHIO MARGARET URSULA and others masked
Lady will you walk about with your friend
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing
I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away
With me in your company
I may say so when I please
And when please you to say so
When I like your favour for God defend the lute
should be like the case
My visor is Philemons roof within the house is Jove
Why then your visor should be thatched
Speak low if you speak love
Drawing her aside
Well I would you did like me
So would not I for your own sake for I have many
illqualities
Which is one
I say my prayers aloud
I love you the better the hearers may cry Amen
God match me with a good dancer
Amen
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
done Answer clerk
No more words the clerk is answered
I know you well enough you are Signior Antonio
At a word I am not
I know you by the waggling of your head
To tell you true I counterfeit him
You could never do him so illwell unless you were
the very man Heres his dry hand up and down you
are he you are he
At a word I am not
Come come do you think I do not know you by your
excellent wit can virtue hide itself Go to
mum you are he graces will appear and theres an
end
Will you not tell me who told you so
No you shall pardon me
Nor will you not tell me who you are
Not now
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit
out of the Hundred Merry Taleswell this was
Signior Benedick that said so
Whats he
I am sure you know him well enough
Not I believe me
Did he never make you laugh
I pray you what is he
Why he is the princes jester a very dull fool
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders
none but libertines delight in him and the
commendation is not in his wit but in his villany
for he both pleases men and angers them and then
they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in
the fleet I would he had boarded me
When I know the gentleman Ill tell him what you say
Do do hell but break a comparison or two on me
which peradventure not marked or not laughed at
strikes him into melancholy and then theres a
partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no
supper that night
Music
We must follow the leaders
In every good thing
Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at
the next turning
Dance Then exeunt all except DON JOHN BORACHIO and CLAUDIO
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
withdrawn her father to break with him about it
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains
And that is Claudio I know him by his bearing
Are not you Signior Benedick
You know me well I am he
Signior you are very near my brother in his love
he is enamoured on Hero I pray you dissuade him
from her she is no equal for his birth you may
do the part of an honest man in it
How know you he loves her
I heard him swear his affection
So did I too and he swore he would marry her tonight
Come let us to the banquet
Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio
Tis certain so the prince wooes for himself
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood
This is an accident of hourly proof
Which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero
Reenter BENEDICK
Count Claudio
Yea the same
Come will you go with me
Whither
Even to the next willow about your own business
county What fashion will you wear the garland of
about your neck like an usurers chain or under
your arm like a lieutenants scarf You must wear
it one way for the prince hath got your Hero
I wish him joy of her
Why thats spoken like an honest drovier so they
sell bullocks But did you think the prince would
have served you thus
I pray you leave me
Ho now you strike like the blind man twas the
boy that stole your meat and youll beat the post
If it will not be Ill leave you
Exit
Alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not
know me The princes fool Ha It may be I go
under that title because I am merry Yea but so I
am apt to do myself wrong I am not so reputed it
is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
out Well Ill be revenged as I may
Reenter DON PEDRO
Now signior wheres the count did you see him
Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
warren I told him and I think I told him true
that your grace had got the good will of this young
lady and I offered him my company to a willowtree
either to make him a garland as being forsaken or
to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped
To be whipped Whats his fault
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being
overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his
companion and he steals it
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression The
transgression is in the stealer
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made
and the garland too for the garland he might have
worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on
you who as I take it have stolen his birds nest
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to
the owner
If their singing answer your saying by my faith
you say honestly
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you the
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
wronged by you
O she misused me past the endurance of a block
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her She told me not thinking I had been
myself that I was the princes jester that I was
duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at
me She speaks poniards and every word stabs
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations
there were no living near her she would infect to
the north star I would not marry her though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed she would have made Hercules have
turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make
the fire too Come talk not of her you shall find
her the infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God
some scholar would conjure her for certainly while
she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they
would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror
and perturbation follows her
Look here she comes
Enter CLAUDIO BEATRICE HERO and LEONATO
Will your grace command me any service to the
worlds end I will go on the slightest errand now
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on
I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the
furthest inch of Asia bring you the length of
Prester Johns foot fetch you a hair off the great
Chams beard do you any embassage to the Pigmies
rather than hold three words conference with this
harpy You have no employment for me
None but to desire your good company
O God sir heres a dish I love not I cannot
endure my Lady Tongue
Exit
Come lady come you have lost the heart of
Signior Benedick
Indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and I gave
him use for it a double heart for his single one
marry once before he won it of me with false dice
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it
You have put him down lady you have put him down
So I would not he should do me my lord lest I
should prove the mother of fools I have brought
Count Claudio whom you sent me to seek
Why how now count wherefore are you sad
Not sad my lord
How then sick
Neither my lord
The count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor
well but civil count civil as an orange and
something of that jealous complexion
I faith lady I think your blazon to be true
though Ill be sworn if he be so his conceit is
false Here Claudio I have wooed in thy name and
fair Hero is won I have broke with her father
and his good will obtained name the day of
marriage and God give thee joy
Count take of me my daughter and with her my
fortunes his grace hath made the match and an
grace say Amen to it
Speak count tis your cue
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were
but little happy if I could say how much Lady as
you are mine I am yours I give away myself for
you and dote upon the exchange
Speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth
with a kiss and let not him speak neither
In faith lady you have a merry heart
Yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on
the windy side of care My cousin tells him in his
ear that he is in her heart
And so she doth cousin
Good Lord for alliance Thus goes every one to the
world but I and I am sunburnt I may sit in a
corner and cry heighho for a husband
Lady Beatrice I will get you one
I would rather have one of your fathers getting
Hath your grace neer a brother like you Your
father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them
Will you have me lady
No my lord unless I might have another for
workingdays your grace is too costly to wear
every day But I beseech your grace pardon me I
was born to speak all mirth and no matter
Your silence most offends me and to be merry best
becomes you for out of question you were born in
a merry hour
No sure my lord my mother cried but then there
was a star danced and under that was I born
Cousins God give you joy
Niece will you look to those things I told you of
I cry you mercy uncle By your graces pardon
Exit
By my troth a pleasantspirited lady
Theres little of the melancholy element in her my
lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and
not ever sad then for I have heard my daughter say
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
herself with laughing
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
O by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit
She were an excellent wife for Benedict
O Lord my lord if they were but a week married
they would talk themselves mad
County Claudio when mean you to go to church
Tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love
have all his rites
Not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just
sevennight and a time too brief too to have all
things answer my mind
Come you shake the head at so long a breathing
but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go
dully by us I will in the interim undertake one of
Hercules labours which is to bring Signior
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
affection the one with the other I would fain have
it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if
you three will but minister such assistance as I
shall give you direction
My lord I am for you though it cost me ten
nights watchings
And I my lord
And you too gentle Hero
I will do any modest office my lord to help my
cousin to a good husband
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
I know Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble
strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty I
will teach you how to humour your cousin that she
shall fall in love with Benedick and I with your
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he
shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this
Cupid is no longer an archer hi s glory shall be
ours for we are the only lovegods Go in with me
and I will tell you my drift
Exeunt
Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO
It is so the Count Claudio shall marry the
daughter of Leonato
Yea my lord but I can cross it
Any bar any cross any impediment will be
medicinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
evenly with mine How canst thou cross this marriage
Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no
dishonesty shall appear in me
Show me briefly how
I think I told your lordship a year since how much
I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting
gentlewoman to Hero
I remember
I can at any unseasonable instant of the night
appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber window
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage
The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to
the prince your brother spare not to tell him that
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
Claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold
upto a contaminated stale such a one as Hero
What proof shall I make of that
Proof enough to misuse the prince to vex Claudio
to undo Hero and kill Leonato Look you for any
other issue
Only to despite them I will endeavour any thing
Go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know
that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the
prince and Claudio asin love of your brothers
honour who hath made this match and his friends
reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the
semblance of a maidthat you have discovered
thus They will scarcely believe this without trial
offer them instances which shall bear no less
likelihood than to see me at her chamberwindow
hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me
Claudio and bring them to see this the very night
before the intended weddingfor in the meantime I
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absentand there shall appear such seeming truth
of Heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
assurance and all the preparation overthrown
Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put
thy fee is a thousand ducats
Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning
shall not shame me
I will presently go learn their day of marriage
Exeunt
Enter BENEDICK
Boy
Enter Boy
Signior
In my chamberwindow lies a book bring it hither
to me in the orchard
I am here already sir
I know that but I would have thee hence and here again
Exit Boy
I do much wonder that one man seeing how much
another man is a fool when he dedicates his
behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others become the argument
of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man
is Claudio I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife and now had he
rather hear the tabour and the pipe I have known
when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a
good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake
carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to
speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man
and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his
words are a very fantastical banquet just so many
strange dishes May I be so converted and see with
these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not
be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but
Ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster
of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman
is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am
well another virtuous yet I am well but till all
graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in
my grace Rich she shall be thats certain wise
or Ill none virtuous or Ill never cheapen her
fair or Ill   never look on her mild or come not
near me noble or not I for an angel of good
discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall
be of what colour it please God Ha the prince and
Monsieur Love I will hide me in the arbour
Withdraws
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO and LEONATO
Come shall we hear this music
Yea my good lord How still the evening is
As hushd on purpose to grace harmony
See you where Benedick hath hid himself
O very well my lord the music ended
Well fit the kidfox with a pennyworth
Enter BALTHASAR with Music
Come Balthasar well hear that song again
O good my lord tax not so bad a voice
To slander music any more than once
It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection
I pray thee sing and let me woo no more
Because you talk of wooing I will sing
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes
Yet will he swear he loves
Now pray thee come
Or if thou wilt hold longer argument
Do it in notes
Note this before my notes
Theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting
Why these are very crotchets that he speaks
Note notes forsooth and nothing
Air
Now divine air now is his soul ravished Is it
not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out
of mens bodies Well a horn for my money when
alls done
The Song
Sigh no more ladies sigh no more
Men were deceivers ever
One foot in sea and one on shore
To one thing constant never
Then sigh not so but let them go
And be you blithe and bonny
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny nonny
Sing no more ditties sing no moe
Of dumps so dull and heavy
The fraud of men was ever so
Since summer first was leafy
Then sigh not so  and c
By my troth a good song
And an ill singer my lord
Ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus
they would have hanged him and I pray God his bad
voice bode no mischief I had as lief have heard the
nightraven come what plague could have come after
it
Yea marry dost thou hear Balthasar I pray thee
get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we
would have it at the Lady Heros chamberwindow
The best I can my lord
Do so farewell
Exit BALTHASAR
Come hither Leonato What was it you told me of
today that your niece Beatrice was in love with
Signior Benedick
O ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits I did
never think that lady would have loved any man
No nor I neither but most wonderful that she
should so dote on Signior Benedick whom she hath in
all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor
Ist possible Sits the wind in that corner
By my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think
of it but that she loves him with an enraged
affection it is past the infinite of thought
May be she doth but counterfeit
Faith like enough
O God counterfeit There was never counterfeit of
passion came so near the life of passion as she
discovers it
Why what effects of passion shows she
Bait the hook well this fish will bite
What effects my lord She will sit you you heard
my daughter tell you how
She did indeed
How how pray you You amaze me I would have I
thought her spirit had been invincible against all
assaults of affection
I would have sworn it had my lord especially
against Benedick
I should think this a gull but that the
whitebearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot
sure hide himself in such reverence
He hath taen the infection hold it up
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick
No and swears she never will thats her torment
Tis true indeed so your daughter says Shall
I says she that have so oft encountered him
with scorn write to him that I love him
This says she now when she is beginning to write to
him for shell be up twenty times a night and
there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
sheet of paper my daughter tells us all
Now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a
pretty jest your daughter told us of
O when she had writ it and was reading it over she
found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet
That
O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence
railed at herself that she should be so immodest
to write to one that she knew would flout her I
measure him says she by my own spirit for I
should flout him if he writ to me yea though I
love him I should
Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs
beats her heart tears her hair prays curses O
sweet Benedick God give me patience
She doth indeed my daughter says so and the
ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
to herself it is very true
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
other if she will not discover it
To what end He would make but a sport of it and
torment the poor lady worse
An he should it were an alms to hang him Shes an
excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion
she is virtuous
And she is exceeding wise
In every thing but in loving Benedick
O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender
a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
the victory I am sorry for her as I have just
cause being her uncle and her guardian
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would
have daffed all other respects and made her half
myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear
what a will say
Were it good think you
Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she
will die if he love her not and she will die ere
she make her love known and she will die if he woo
her rather than she will bate one breath of her
accustomed crossness
She doth well if she should make tender of her
love tis very possible hell scorn it for the
man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit
He is a very proper man
He hath indeed a good outward happiness
Before God and in my mind very wise
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
And I take him to be valiant
As Hector I assure you and in the managing of
quarrels you may say he is wise for either he
avoids them with great discretion or undertakes
them with a most Christianlike fear
If he do fear God a must necessarily keep peace
if he break the peace he ought to enter into a
quarrel with fear and trembling
And so will he do for the man doth fear God
howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall
we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love
Never tell him my lord let her wear it out with
good counsel
Nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first
Well we will hear further of it by your daughter
let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I
could wish he would modestly examine himself to see
how much he is unworthy so good a lady
My lord will you walk dinner is ready
If he do not dote on her upon this I will never
trust my expectation
Let there be the same net spread for her and that
must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry The
sport will be when they hold one an opinion of
anothers dotage and no such matter thats the
dumbshow Let us send her to call him in to dinner
Exeunt DON PEDRO CLAUDIO and LEONATO
Coming forward  This can be no trick the
conference was sadly borne They have the truth of
this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it
seems her affections have their full bent Love me
why it must be requited I hear how I am censured
they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive
the love come from her they say too that she will
rather die than give any sign of affection I did
never think to marry I must not seem proud happy
them to mending They say the lady is fair tis a
truth I can bear them witness and virtuous tis
so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving
me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor
no great argument of her folly for I will be
horribly in love with her I may chance have some
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me
because I have railed so long against marriage but
doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour
No the world must be peopled When I said I would
die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I
were married Here comes Beatrice By this day
shes a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in
her
Enter BEATRICE
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner
Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
pains to thank me if it had been painful I would
not have come
You take pleasure then in the message
Yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes
point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach
signior fare you well
Exit
Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
to dinner theres a double meaning in that I took
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
to thank me thats as much as to say Any pains
that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do
not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not
love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture
Exit
Enter HERO MARGARET and URSULA
Good Margaret run thee to the parlor
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the prince and Claudio
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
Is all of her say that thou overheardst us
And bid her steal into the pleached bower
Where honeysuckles ripend by the sun
Forbid the sun to enter like favourites
Made proud by princes that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it there will she hide her
To listen our purpose  This is thy office
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone
Ill make her come I warrant you presently
Exit
Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come
As we do trace this alley up and down
Our talk must only be of Benedick
When I do name him let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice Of this matter
Is little Cupids crafty arrow made
That only wounds by hearsay
Enter BEATRICE behind
Now begin
For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
Close by the ground to hear our conference
The pleasantst angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
And greedily devour the treacherous bait
So angle we for Beatrice who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture
Fear you not my part of the dialogue
Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
Approaching the bower
No truly Ursula she is too disdainful
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggerds of the rock
But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely
So says the prince and my newtrothed lord
And did they bid you tell her of it madam
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it
But I persuaded them if they loved Benedick
To wish him wrestle with affection
And never to let Beatrice know of it
Why did you so Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon
O god of love I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man
But Nature never framed a womans heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
Misprising what they look on and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak she cannot love
Nor take no shape nor project of affection
She is so selfendeared
Sure I think so
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love lest she make sport at it
Why you speak truth I never yet saw man
How wise how noble young how rarely featured
But she would spell him backward if fairfaced
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister
If black why Nature drawing of an antique
Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded
If low an agate very vilely cut
If speaking why a vane blown with all winds
If silent why a block moved with none
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth
Sure sure such carping is not commendable
No not to be so odd and from all fashions
As Beatrice is cannot be commendable
But who dare tell her so If I should speak
She would mock me into air O she would laugh me
Out of myself press me to death with wit
Therefore let Benedick like coverd fire
Consume away in sighs waste inwardly
It were a better death than die with mocks
Which is as bad as die with tickling
Yet tell her of it hear what she will say
No rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion
And truly Ill devise some honest slanders
To stain my cousin with one doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking
O do not do your cousin such a wrong
She cannot be so much without true judgment
Having so swift and excellent a wit
As she is prized to haveas to refuse
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick
He is the only man of Italy
Always excepted my dear Claudio
I pray you be not angry with me madam
Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick
For shape for bearing argument and valour
Goes foremost in report through Italy
Indeed he hath an excellent good name
His excellence did earn it ere he had it
When are you married madam
Why every day tomorrow Come go in
Ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel
Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow
Shes limed I warrant you we have caught her madam
If it proves so then loving goes by haps
Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps
Exeunt HERO and URSULA
Coming forward
What fire is in mine ears Can this be true
Stand I condemnd for pride and scorn so much
Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
No glory lives behind the back of such
And Benedick love on I will requite thee
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
To bind our loves up in a holy band
For others say thou dost deserve and I
Believe it better than reportingly
Exit
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO BENEDICK and LEONATO
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and
then go I toward Arragon
Ill bring you thither my lord if youll
vouchsafe me
Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold
with Benedick for his company for from the crown
of his head to the sole of his foot he is all
mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids
bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at
him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his
tongue speaks
Gallants I am not as I have been
So say Imethinks you are sadder
I hope he be in love
Hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in
him to be truly touched with love if he be sad
he wants money
I have the toothache
Draw it
Hang it
You must hang it first and draw it afterwards
What sigh for the toothache
Where is but a humour or a worm
Well every one can master a grief but he that has
it
Yet say I he is in love
There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be
a Dutchman today a Frenchman tomorrow or in the
shape of two countries at once as a German from
the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from
the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy
to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no
fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is
If he be not in love with some woman there is no
believing old signs a brushes his hat o
mornings what should that bode
Hath any man seen him at the barbers
No but the barbers man hath been seen with him
and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
stuffed tennisballs
Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard
Nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him
out by that
Thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love
The greatest note of it is his melancholy
And when was he wont to wash his face
Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear
what they say of him
Nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into
a lutestring and now governed by stops
Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude
conclude he is in love
Nay but I know who loves him
That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not
Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of
all dies for him
She shall be buried with her face upwards
Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old
signior walk aside with me I have studied eight
or nine wise words to speak to you which these
hobbyhorses must not hear
Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO
For my life to break with him about Beatrice
Tis even so Hero and Margaret have by this
played their parts with Beatrice and then the two
bears will not bite one another when they meet
Enter DON JOHN
My lord and brother God save you
Good den brother
If your leisure served I would speak with you
In private
If it please you yet Count Claudio may hear for
what I would speak of concerns him
Whats the matter
To CLAUDIO  Means your lordship to be married
tomorrow
You know he does
I know not that when he knows what I know
If there be any impediment I pray you discover it
You may think I love you not let that appear
hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will
manifest For my brother I think he holds you
well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and
labour ill bestowed
Why whats the matter
I came hither to tell you and circumstances
shortened for she has been too long a talking of
the lady is disloyal
Who Hero
Even she Leonatos Hero your Hero every mans Hero
Disloyal
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness I
could say she were worse think you of a worse
title and I will fit her to it Wonder not till
further warrant go but with me tonight you shall
see her chamberwindow entered even the night
before her weddingday if you love her then
tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour
to change your mind
May this be so
I will not think it
If you dare not trust that you see confess not
that you know if you will follow me I will show
you enough and when you have seen more and heard
more proceed accordingly
If I see any thing tonight why I should not marry
her tomorrow in the congregation where I should
wed there will I shame her
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join
with thee to disgrace her
I will disparage her no farther till you are my
witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and
let the issue show itself
O day untowardly turned
O mischief strangely thwarting
O plague right well prevented so will you say when
you have seen the sequel
Exeunt
Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch
Are you good men and true
Yea or else it were pity but they should suffer
salvation body and soul
Nay that were a punishment too good for them if
they should have any allegiance in them being
chosen for the princes watch
Well give them their charge neighbour Dogberry
First who think you the most desertless man to be
constable
Hugh Otecake sir or George Seacole for they can
write and read
Come hither neighbour Seacole God hath blessed
you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is
the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature
Both which master constable
You have I knew it would be your answer Well
for your favour sir why give God thanks and make
no boast of it and for your writing and reading
let that appear when there is no need of such
vanity You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch therefore bear you the lantern This is your
charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are
to bid any man stand in the princes name
How if a will not stand
Why then take no note of him but let him go and
presently call the rest of the watch together and
thank God you are rid of a knave
If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none
of the princes subjects
True and they are to meddle with none but the
princes subjects You shall also make no noise in
the streets for for the watch to babble and to
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured
We will rather sleep than talk we know what
belongs to a watch
Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet
watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should
offend only have a care that your bills be not
stolen Well you are to call at all the
alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
How if they will not
Why then let them alone till they are sober if
they make you not then the better answer you may
say they are not the men you took them for
Well sir
If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue
of your office to be no true man and for such
kind of men the less you meddle or make with them
why the more is for your honesty
If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay
hands on him
Truly by your office you may but I think they
that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable
way for you if you do take a thief is to let him
show himself what he is and steal out of your company
You have been always called a merciful man partner
Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more
a man who hath any honesty in him
If you hear a child cry in the night you must call
to the nurse and bid her still it
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
Why then depart in peace and let the child wake
her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats
Tis very true
This is the end of the chargeyou constable are
to present the princes own person if you meet the
prince in the night you may stay him
Nay byr our lady that I think a cannot
Five shillings to one ont with any man that knows
the statutes he may stay him marry not without
the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought
to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will
Byr lady I think it be so
Ha ha ha Well masters good night an there be
any matter of weight chances call up me keep your
fellows counsels and your own and good night
Come neighbour
Well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here
upon the churchbench till two and then all to bed
One word more honest neighbours I pray you watch
about Signior Leonatos door for the wedding being
there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight
Adieu be vigitant I beseech you
Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES
Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE
What Conrade
Aside  Peace stir not
Conrade I say
Here man I am at thy elbow
Mass and my elbow itched I thought there would a
scab follow
I will owe thee an answer for that and now forward
with thy tale
Stand thee close then under this penthouse for
it drizzles rain and I will like a true drunkard
utter all to thee
Aside  Some treason masters yet stand close
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
villany should be so rich for when rich villains
have need of poor ones poor ones may make what
price they will
I wonder at it
That shows thou art unconfirmed Thou knowest that
the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is
nothing to a man
Yes it is apparel
I mean the fashion
Yes the fashion is the fashion
Tush I may as well say the fools the fool But
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
is
Aside  I know that Deformed a has been a vile
thief this seven year a goes up and down like a
gentleman I remember his name
Didst thou not hear somebody
No twas the vane on the house
Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this
fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot
bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaohs soldiers
in the reeky painting sometime like god Bels
priests in the old churchwindow sometime like the
shaven Hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club
All this I see and I see that the fashion wears
out more apparel than the man But art not thou
thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion
Not so neither but know that I have tonight
wooed Margaret the Lady Heros gentlewoman by the
name of Hero she leans me out at her mistress
chamberwindow bids me a thousand times good
nightI tell this tale vilelyI should first
tell thee how the prince Claudio and my master
planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter
And thought they Margaret was Hero
Two of them did the prince and Claudio but the
devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly
by his oaths which first possessed them partly by
the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly
by my villany which did confirm any slander that
Don John had made away went Claudio enraged swore
he would meet her as he was appointed next morning
at the temple and there before the whole
congregation shame her with what he saw oer night
and send her home again without a husband
We charge you in the princes name stand
Call up the right master constable We have here
recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
ever was known in the commonwealth
And one Deformed is one of them I know him a
wears a lock
Masters masters
Youll be made bring Deformed forth I warrant you
Masters
Never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us
We are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken
up of these mens bills
A commodity in question I warrant you Come well obey you

fashion i faith I saw the Duchess of Milans
gown that they praise so

By my troth s but a nightgown in respect of
yours cloth o gold and cuts and laced with
silver set with pearls down sleeves side sleeves
and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel
but for a fine quaint graceful and excellent
fashion yours is worth ten on t
God give me joy to wear it for my heart is
exceeding heavy
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man
Fie upon thee art not ashamed
Of what lady of speaking honourably Is not
marriage honourable in a beggar Is not your lord
honourable without marriage I think you would have
me say saving your reverence a husband and bad
thinking do not wrest true speaking Ill offend

husband None I think and it be the right husband
and the right wife otherwise tis light and not
heavy ask my Lady Beatrice else here she comes

meant plain holythistle You may think perchance
that I think you are in love nay byr lady I am
not such a fool to think what I list nor I list
not to think what I can nor indeed I cannot think
if I would think my heart out of thinking that you
are in love or that you will be in love or that you
can be in love Yet Benedick was such another and
now is he become a man he swore he would never
marry and yet now in despite of his heart he eats
his meat without grudging and how you may be
converted I know not but methinks you look with
your eyes as other women do
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps
Not a false gallop

Yes I thank God I am as honest as any man living

Comparisons are odorous palabras neighbour Verges
Neighbours you are tedious
It pleases your worship to say so but we are the

my heart to bestow it all of your worship
All thy tediousness on me ah

Exeunt
Enter DON PEDRO DON JOHN LEONATO FRIAR FRANCIS CLAUDIO BENEDICK HERO BEATRICE and Attendants
Come Friar Francis be brief only to the plain
form of marriage and you shall recount their
particular duties afterwards
You come hither my lord to marry this lady
No
To be married to her friar you come to marry her
Lady you come hither to be married to this count
I do
If either of you know any inward impediment why you
should not be conjoined charge you on your souls
to utter it
Know you any Hero
None my lord
Know you any count
I dare make his answer none
O what men dare do what men may do what men daily
do not knowing what they do
How now interjections Why then some be of
laughing as ah ha he
Stand thee by friar Father by your leave
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Give me this maid your daughter
As freely son as God did give her me
And what have I to give you back whose worth
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift
Nothing unless you render her again
Sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
There Leonato take her back again
Give not this rotten orange to your friend
Shes but the sign and semblance of her honour
Behold how like a maid she blushes here
O what authority and show of truth
Can cunning sin cover itself withal
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
To witness simple virtue Would you not swear
All you that see her that she were a maid
By these exterior shows But she is none
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed
Her blush is guiltiness not modesty
What do you mean my lord
Not to be married
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton
Dear my lord if you in your own proof
Have vanquishd the resistance of her youth
And made defeat of her virginity
I know what you would say if I have known her
You will say she did embrace me as a husband
And so extenuate the forehand sin
No Leonato
I never tempted her with word too large
But as a brother to his sister showd
Bashful sincerity and comely love
And seemd I ever otherwise to you
Out on thee Seeming I will write against it
You seem to me as Dian in her orb
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
But you are more intemperate in your blood
Than Venus or those pamperd animals
That rage in savage sensuality
Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
Sweet prince why speak not you
What should I speak
I stand dishonourd that have gone about
To link my dear friend to a common stale
Are these things spoken or do I but dream
Sir they are spoken and these things are true
This looks not like a nuptial
True O God
Leonato stand I here
Is this the prince is this the princes brother
Is this face Heros are our eyes our own
All this is so but what of this my lord
Let me but move one question to your daughter
And by that fatherly and kindly power
That you have in her bid her answer truly
I charge thee do so as thou art my child
O God defend me how am I beset
What kind of catechising call you this
To make you answer truly to your name
Is it not Hero Who can blot that name
With any just reproach
Marry that can Hero
Hero itself can blot out Heros virtue
What man was he talkd with you yesternight
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one
Now if you are a maid answer to this
I talkd with no man at that hour my lord
Why then are you no maiden Leonato
I am sorry you must hear upon mine honour
Myself my brother and this grieved count
Did see her hear her at that hour last night
Talk with a ruffian at her chamberwindow
Who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
Confessd the vile encounters they have had
A thousand times in secret
Fie fie they are not to be named my lord
Not to be spoke of
There is not chastity enough in language
Without offence to utter them Thus pretty lady
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment
O Hero what a Hero hadst thou been
If half thy outward graces had been placed
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
But fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
Thou pure impiety and impious purity
For thee Ill lock up all the gates of love
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
And never shall it more be gracious
Hath no mans dagger here a point for me
HERO swoons
Why how now cousin wherefore sink you down
Come let us go These things come thus to light
Smother her spirits up
Exeunt DON PEDRO DON JOHN and CLAUDIO
How doth the lady
Dead I think Help uncle

O Fate take not away thy heavy hand

Have comfort lady
Dost thou look up
Yea wherefore should she not
Wherefore Why doth not every earthly thing
Cry shame upon her Could she here deny
The story that is printed in her blood
Do not live Hero do not ope thine eyes
For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
Myself would on the rearward of reproaches
Strike at thy life Grieved I I had but one
Chid I for that at frugal natures frame
O one too much by thee Why had I one
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
Why had I not with charitable hand
Took up a beggars issue at my gates
Who smirchd thus and mired with infamy
I might have said No part of it is mine
This shame derives itself from unknown loins
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
And mine that I was proud on mine so much
That I myself was to myself not mine
Valuing of herwhy she O she is fallen
Into a pit of ink that the wide sea
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
And salt too little which may season give
To her foultainted flesh
Sir sir be patient
For my part I am so attired in wonder
I know not what to say
O on my soul my cousin is belied
Lady were you her bedfellow last night
No truly not although until last night
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
Confirmd confirmd O that is stronger made
Which was before barrd up with ribs of iron
Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie
Who loved her so that speaking of her foulness
Washd it with tears Hence from her let her die
Hear me a little
For I have only been silent so long
And given way unto this course of fortune

By noting of the lady I have markd
A thousand blushing apparitions
To start into her face a thousand innocent shames
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes
And in her eye there hath appeard a fire
To burn the errors that these princes hold
Against her maiden truth Call me a fool
Trust not my reading nor my observations
Which with experimental seal doth warrant
The tenor of my book trust not my age
My reverence calling nor divinity
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
Under some biting error
Friar it cannot be
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
Is that she will not add to her damnation
A sin of perjury she not denies it
Why seekst thou then to cover with excuse
That which appears in proper nakedness
Lady what man is he you are accused of
They know that do accuse me I know none
If I know more of any man alive
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
Let all my sins lack mercy O my father
Prove you that any man with me conversed
At hours unmeet or that I yesternight
Maintaind the change of words with any creature
Refuse me hate me torture me to death
There is some strange misprision in the princes
Two of them have the very bent of honour
And if their wisdoms be misled in this
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies
I know not If they speak but truth of her
These hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour
The proudest of them shall well hear of it
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
Nor age so eat up my invention
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
But they shall find awaked in such a kind
Both strength of limb and policy of mind
Ability in means and choice of friends
To quit me of them throughly
Pause awhile
And let my counsel sway you in this case
Your daughter here the princes left for dead
Let her awhile be secretly kept in
And publish it that she is dead indeed
Maintain a mourning ostentation
And on your familys old monument
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial
What shall become of this what will this do
Marry this well carried shall on her behalf
Change slander to remorse that is some good
But not for that dream I on this strange course
But on this travail look for greater birth
She dying as it must so be maintaind
Upon the instant that she was accused
Shall be lamented pitied and excused
Of every hearer for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost
Why then we rack the value then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio
When he shall hear she died upon his words
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination
And every lovely organ of her life
Shall come apparelld in more precious habit
More movingdelicate and full of life
Into the eye and prospect of his soul
Than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn
If ever love had interest in his liver
And wish he had not so accused her
No though he thought his accusation true
Let this be so and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood
But if all aim but this be levelld false
The supposition of the ladys death
Will quench the wonder of her infamy
And if it sort not well you may conceal her
As best befits her wounded reputation
In some reclusive and religious life
Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
Signior Leonato let the friar advise you
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio
Yet by mine honour I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body
Being that I flow in grief
The smallest twine may lead me
Tis well consented presently away
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
Come lady die to live this weddingday
Perhaps is but prolongd have patience and endure
Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE
Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while
Yea and I will weep a while longer
I will not desire that
You have no reason I do it freely
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged
Ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her
Is there any way to show such friendship
A very even way but no such friend
May a man do it
It is a mans office but not yours
I do love nothing in the world so well as you is
not that strange
As strange as the thing I know not It were as
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
you but believe me not and yet I lie not I
confess nothing nor I deny nothing I am sorry for my cousin
By my sword Beatrice thou lovest me
Do not swear and eat it
I will swear by it that you love me and I will make
him eat it that says I love not you
Will you not eat your word
With no sauce that can be devised to it I protest
I love thee
Why then God forgive me
What offence sweet Beatrice
You have stayed me in a happy hour I was about to
protest I loved you
And do it with all thy heart
I love you with so much of my heart that none is
left to protest
Come bid me do any thing for thee
Kill Claudio
Ha not for the wide world
You kill me to deny it Farewell
Tarry sweet Beatrice
I am gone though I am here there is no love in
you nay I pray you let me go
Beatrice
In faith I will go
Well be friends first
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy
Is Claudio thine enemy
Is he not approved in the height a villain that
hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman O
that I were a man What bear her in hand until they
come to take hands and then with public
accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour
NAME
in the marketplace
Hear me Beatrice
Talk with a man out at a window A proper saying
Nay but Beatrice
Sweet Hero She is wronged she is slandered she is undone
Beat
Princes and counties Surely a princely testimony
a goodly count Count Comfect a sweet gallant
surely O that I were a man for his sake or that I
had any friend would be a man for my sake But
manhood is melted into courtesies valour into
compliment and men are only turned into tongue and
trim ones too he is now as valiant as Hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it I cannot be a
man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with grieving
Tarry good Beatrice By this hand I love thee
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero
Yea as sure as I have a thought or a soul
Enough I am engaged I will challenge him I will
kiss your hand and so I leave you By this hand
Claudio shall render me a dear account As you
hear of me so think of me Go comfort your
cousin I must say she is dead and so farewell
Exeunt
Enter DOGBERRY VERGES and Sexton in gowns and the Watch with CONRADE and BORACHIO
Is our whole dissembly appeared
O a stool and a cushion for the sexton
Marry that am I and my partner
Nay thats certain we have the exhibition to examine
But which are the offenders that are to be
examined let them come before master constable
Yea marry let them come before me What is your
name friend
Borachio
Pray write down Borachio Yours sirrah
I am a gentleman sir and my name is Conrade
Write down master gentleman Conrade Masters do
you serve God
Yea sir we hope
Write down that they hope they serve God and
write God first for God defend but God should go
before such villains Masters it is proved already
that you are little better than false knaves and it
will go near to be thought so shortly How answer
you for yourselves
Marry sir we say we are none
A marvellous witty fellow I assure you but I
will go about with him Come you hither sirrah a
word in your ear sir I say to you it is thought
you are false knaves
Sir I say to you we are none
Well stand aside Fore God they are both in a
tale Have you writ down that they are none
Master constable you go not the way to examine
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers
Yea marry thats the eftest way Let the watch
come forth Masters I charge you in the princes
name accuse these men
This man said sir that Don John the princes
brother was a villain
Write down Prince John a villain Why this is flat
perjury to call a princes brother villain
Master constable
Pray thee fellow peace I do not like thy look
I promise thee
What heard you him say else
Marry that he had received a thousand ducats of
Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully
Flat burglary as ever was committed
Yea by mass that it is
What else fellow
And that Count Claudio did mean upon his words to
disgrace Hero before the whole assembly and not marry her
O villain thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
redemption for this
What else
This is all
And this is more masters than you can deny
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away
Hero was in this manner accused in this very manner
refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died
Master constable let these men be bound and
brought to Leonatos I will go before and show
him their examination
Exit
Come let them be opinioned
Let them be in the hands
Off coxcomb
Gods my life wheres the sexton let him write
down the princes officer coxcomb Come bind them
Thou naughty varlet
Away you are an ass you are an ass
Dost thou not suspect my place dost thou not
suspect my years O that he were here to write me
down an ass But masters remember that I am an
ass though it be not written down yet forget not
that I am an ass No thou villain thou art full of
piety as shall be proved upon thee by good witness
I am a wise fellow and which is more an officer
and which is more a householder and which is
more as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
Messina and one that knows the law go to and a
rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that hath
had losses and one that hath two gowns and every
thing handsome about him Bring him away O that
I had been writ down an ass
Exeunt
Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO
If you go on thus you will kill yourself
And tis not wisdom thus to second grief
Against yourself
I pray thee cease thy counsel
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve give not me counsel
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
Bring me a father that so loved his child
Whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine
And bid him speak of patience
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
And let it answer every strain for strain
As thus for thus and such a grief for such
In every lineament branch shape and form
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard
Bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan
Patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
With candlewasters bring him yet to me
And I of him will gather patience
But there is no such man for brother men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel but tasting it
Their counsel turns to passion which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread
Charm ache with air and agony with words
No no tis all mens office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sorrow
But no mans virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself Therefore give me no counsel
My griefs cry louder than advertisement
Therein do men from children nothing differ
I pray thee peace I will be flesh and blood
For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothache patiently
However they have writ the style of gods
And made a push at chance and sufferance
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
Make those that do offend you suffer too
There thou speakst reason nay I will do so
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied
And that shall Claudio know so shall the prince
And all of them that thus dishonour her
Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily
Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO
Good den good den
Good day to both of you
Hear you my lords
We have some haste Leonato
Some haste my lord well fare you well my lord
Are you so hasty now well all is one
Nay do not quarrel with us good old man
If he could right himself with quarreling
Some of us would lie low
Who wrongs him
Marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
Nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
I fear thee not
Marry beshrew my hand
If it should give your age such cause of fear
In faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
Tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool
As under privilege of age to brag
What I have done being young or what would do
Were I not old Know Claudio to thy head
Thou hast so wrongd mine innocent child and me
That I am forced to lay my reverence by
And with grey hairs and bruise of many days
Do challenge thee to trial of a man
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
And she lies buried with her ancestors
O in a tomb where never scandal slept
Save this of hers framed by thy villany
My villany
Thine Claudio thine I say
You say not right old man
My lord my lord
Ill prove it on his body if he dare
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood
Away I will not have to do with you
Canst thou so daff me Thou hast killd my child
If thou killst me boy thou shalt kill a man
He shall kill two of us and men indeed
But thats no matter let him kill one first
Win me and wear me let him answer me
Come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me
Sir boy Ill whip you from your foining fence
Nay as I am a gentleman I will
Brother
Content yourself God knows I loved my niece
And she is dead slanderd to death by villains
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue
Boys apes braggarts Jacks milksops
Brother Antony
Hold you content What man I know them yea
And what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
Scrambling outfacing fashionmonging boys
That lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
Go anticly show outward hideousness
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words
How they might hurt their enemies if they durst
And this is all
But brother Antony
Come tis no matter
Do not you meddle let me deal in this
Gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
My heart is sorry for your daughters death
But on my honour she was charged with nothing
But what was true and very full of proof
My lord my lord
I will not hear you
No Come brother away I will be heard
And shall or some of us will smart for it
Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO
See see here comes the man we went to seek
Enter BENEDICK
Now signior what news
Good day my lord
Welcome signior you are almost come to part
almost a fray
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
with two old men without teeth
Leonato and his brother What thinkest thou Had
we fought I doubt we should have been too young for them
In a false quarrel there is no true valour I came
to seek you both
We have been up and down to seek thee for we are
highproof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
away Wilt thou use thy wit
It is in my scabbard shall I draw it
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side
Never any did so though very many have been beside
their wit I will bid thee draw as we do the
minstrels draw to pleasure us
As I am an honest man he looks pale Art thou
sick or angry
What courage man What though care killed a cat
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care
Sir I shall meet your wit in the career and you
charge it against me I pray you choose another subject
Nay then give him another staff this last was
broke cross
By this light he changes more and more I think
he be angry indeed
If he be he knows how to turn his girdle
Shall I speak a word in your ear
God bless me from a challenge
Aside to CLAUDIO  You are a villain I jest not
I will make it good how you dare with what you
dare and when you dare Do me right or I will
protest your cowardice You have killed a sweet
lady and her death shall fall heavy on you Let me
hear from you
Well I will meet you so I may have good cheer
What a feast a feast
I faith I thank him he hath bid me to a calfs
head and a capon the which if I do not carve most
curiously say my knifes naught Shall I not find
a woodcock too
Sir your wit ambles well it goes easily
Ill tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
other day I said thou hadst a fine wit True
said she a fine little one No said I a
great wit Right says she a great gross one
Nay said I a good wit Just said she it
hurts nobody Nay said I the gentleman
is wise Certain said she a wise gentleman
Nay said I he hath the tongues That I
believe said she for he swore a thing to me on
Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning
theres a double tongue theres two tongues Thus
did she an hour together transshape thy particular
virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou
wast the properest man in Italy
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
not
Yea that she did but yet for all that an if she
did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly
the old mans daughter told us all
All all and moreover God saw him when he was
hid in the garden
But when shall we set the savage bulls horns on
the sensible Benedicks head
Yea and text underneath Here dwells Benedick the
married man
Fare you well boy you know my mind I will leave
you now to your gossiplike humour you break jests
as braggarts do their blades which God be thanked
hurt not My lord for your many courtesies I thank
you I must discontinue your company your brother
the bastard is fled from Messina you have among
you killed a sweet and innocent lady For my Lord
Lackbeard there he and I shall meet and till
then peace be with him
Exit
He is in earnest
In most profound earnest and Ill warrant you for
the love of Beatrice
And hath challenged thee
Most sincerely
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
doublet and hose and leaves off his wit
He is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a
doctor to such a man
But soft you let me be pluck up my heart and
be sad Did he not say my brother was fled
Enter DOGBERRY VERGES and the Watch with CONRADE and BORACHIO
Come you sir if justice cannot tame you she
shall neer weigh more reasons in her balance nay
an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be looked to
How now two of my brothers men bound Borachio
one
Hearken after their offence my lord
Officers what offence have these men done
Marry sir they have committed false report
moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily
they are slanders sixth and lastly they have
belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust
things and to conclude they are lying knaves
First I ask thee what they have done thirdly I
ask thee whats their offence sixth and lastly why
they are committed and to conclude what you lay
to their charge
Rightly reasoned and in his own division and by
my troth theres one meaning well suited
Who have you offended masters that you are thus
bound to your answer this learned constable is
too cunning to be understood whats your offence
Sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer
do you hear me and let this count kill me I have
deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms
could not discover these shallow fools have brought
to light who in the night overheard me confessing
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
to slander the Lady Hero how you were brought into
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Heros
garments how you disgraced her when you should
marry her my villany they have upon record which
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
to my shame The lady is dead upon mine and my
masters false accusation and briefly I desire
nothing but the reward of a villain
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood
I have drunk poison whiles he utterd it
But did my brother set thee on to this
He is composed and framed of treachery
And fled he is upon this villany
Sweet Hero now thy image doth appear
In the rare semblance that I loved it first
Come bring away the plaintiffs by this time our
sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter
and masters do not forget to specify when time
and place shall serve that I am an ass
Here here comes master Signior Leonato and the
Sexton too
Reenter LEONATO and ANTONIO with the Sexton
Which is the villain let me see his eyes
That when I note another man like him
I may avoid him which of these is he
If you would know your wronger look on me
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killd
Mine innocent child
Yea even I alone
No not so villain thou beliest thyself
Here stand a pair of honourable men
A third is fled that had a hand in it
I thank you princes for my daughters death
Record it with your high and worthy deeds
Twas bravely done if you bethink you of it
I know not how to pray your patience
Yet I must speak Choose your revenge yourself
Impose me to what penance your invention
Can lay upon my sin yet sinnd I not
But in mistaking
By my soul nor I
And yet to satisfy this good old man
I would bend under any heavy weight
That hell enjoin me to
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live
That were impossible but I pray you both
Possess the people in Messina here
How innocent she died and if your love
Can labour ought in sad invention
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
And sing it to her bones sing it tonight
Tomorrow morning come you to my house
And since you could not be my soninlaw
Be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter
Almost the copy of my child thats dead
And she alone is heir to both of us
Give her the right you should have given her cousin
And so dies my revenge
O noble sir
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me
I do embrace your offer and dispose
For henceforth of poor Claudio
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming
Tonight I take my leave This naughty man
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret
Who I believe was packd in all this wrong
Hired to it by your brother
No by my soul she was not
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me
But always hath been just and virtuous
In any thing that I do know by her
Moreover sir which indeed is not under white and
black this plaintiff here the offender did call
me ass I beseech you let it be remembered in his
punishment And also the watch heard them talk of
one Deformed they say be wears a key in his ear and
a lock hanging by it and borrows money in Gods
name the which he hath used so long and never paid
that now men grow hardhearted and will lend nothing
for Gods sake pray you examine him upon that point
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
reverend youth and I praise God for you
Theres for thy pains
God save the foundation
Go I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank thee
I leave an arrant knave with your worship which I
beseech your worship to correct yourself for the
example of others God keep your worship I wish
your worship well God restore you to health I
humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry
meeting may be wished God prohibit it Come neighbour
Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES
Until tomorrow morning lords farewell
Farewell my lords we look for you tomorrow
We will not fail
Tonight Ill mourn with Hero
To the Watch  Bring you these fellows on Well
talk with Margaret
How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow
Exeunt severally
Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET meeting
Pray thee sweet Mistress Margaret deserve well at
my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty
In so high a style Margaret that no man living
shall come over it for in most comely truth thou
deservest it
To have no man come over me why shall I always
keep below stairs
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhounds mouth it catches
And yours as blunt as the fencers foils which hit
but hurt not
A most manly wit Margaret it will not hurt a
woman and so I pray thee call Beatrice I give
thee the bucklers
Give us the swords we have bucklers of our own
If you use them Margaret you must put in the
pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids
Well I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legs
And therefore will come
Exit MARGARET
Sings
The god of love
That sits above
And knows me and knows me
How pitiful I deserve
I mean in singing but in loving Leander the good
swimmer Troilus the first employer of panders and
a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmangers
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
blank verse why they were never so truly turned
over and over as my poor self in love Marry I
cannot show it in rhyme I have tried I can find
out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent
rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for
school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous
endings no I was not born under a rhyming planet
nor I cannot woo in festival terms
Enter BEATRICE
Sweet Beatrice wouldst thou come when I called thee
Yea signior and depart when you bid me
O stay but till then
Then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere
I go let me go with that I came which is with
knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio
Only foul words and thereupon I will kiss thee
Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but
foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore I
will depart unkissed
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense
so forcible is thy wit But I must tell thee
plainly Claudio undergoes my challenge and either
I must shortly hear from him or I will subscribe
him a coward And I pray thee now tell me for
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
For them all together which maintained so politic
a state of evil that they will not admit any good
part to intermingle with them But for which of my
good parts did you first suffer love for me
Suffer love a good epithet I do suffer love
indeed for I love thee against my will
In spite of your heart I think alas poor heart
If you spite it for my sake I will spite it for
yours for I will never love that which my friend hates
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably
It appears not in this confession theres not one
wise man among twenty that will praise himself
An old an old instance Beatrice that lived in
the lime of good neighbours If a man do not erect
in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live
no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
widow weeps
And how long is that think you
Question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in
rheum therefore is it most expedient for the
wise if Don Worm his conscience find no
impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his
own virtues as I am to myself So much for
praising myself who I myself will bear witness is
praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin
Very ill
And how do you
Very ill too
Serve God love me and mend There will I leave
you too for here comes one in haste
Enter URSULA
Madam you must come to your uncle Yonders old
coil at home it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
falsely accused the prince and Claudio mightily
abused and Don John is the author of all who is
fed and gone Will you come presently
Will you go hear this news signior
I will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be
buried in thy eyes and moreover I will go with
thee to thy uncles
Exeunt
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO and three or four with tapers
Is this the monument of Leonato
It is my lord
Reading out of a scroll
Done to death by slanderous tongues
Was the Hero that here lies
Death in guerdon of her wrongs
Gives her fame which never dies
So the life that died with shame
Lives in death with glorious fame
Hang thou there upon the tomb
Praising her when I am dumb
Now music sound and sing your solemn hymn
SONG
Pardon goddess of the night
Those that slew thy virgin knight
For the which with songs of woe
Round about her tomb they go
Midnight assist our moan
Help us to sigh and groan
Heavily heavily
Graves yawn and yield your dead
Till death be uttered
Heavily heavily
Now unto thy bones good night
Yearly will I do this rite
Good morrow masters put your torches out
The wolves have preyd and look the gentle day
Before the wheels of Phoebus round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
Thanks to you all and leave us fare you well
Good morrow masters each his several way
Come let us hence and put on other weeds
And then to Leonatos we will go
And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds
Than this for whom we renderd up this woe
Exeunt
Enter LEONATO ANTONIO BENEDICK BEATRICE MARGARET URSULA FRIAR FRANCIS and HERO
Did I not tell you she was innocent
So are the prince and Claudio who accused her
Upon the error that you heard debated
But Margaret was in some fault for this
Although against her will as it appears
In the true course of all the question
Well I am glad that all things sort so well
And so am I being else by faith enforced
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it
Well daughter and you gentlewomen all
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves
And when I send for you come hither maskd
Exeunt Ladies
The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
To visit me You know your office brother
You must be father to your brothers daughter
And give her to young Claudio
Which I will do with confirmd countenance
Friar I must entreat your pains I think
To do what signior
To bind me or undo me one of them
Signior Leonato truth it is good signior
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour
That eye my daughter lent her tis most true
And I do with an eye of love requite her
The sight whereof I think you had from me
From Claudio and the prince but whats your will
Your answer sir is enigmatical
But for my will my will is your good will
May stand with ours this day to be conjoind
In the state of honourable marriage
In which good friar I shall desire your help
My heart is with your liking
And my help
Here comes the prince and Claudio
Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO and two or three others
Good morrow to this fair assembly
Good morrow prince good morrow Claudio
We here attend you Are you yet determined
Today to marry with my brothers daughter
Ill hold my mind were she an Ethiope
Call her forth brother heres the friar ready
Exit ANTONIO
Good morrow Benedick Why whats the matter
That you have such a February face
So full of frost of storm and cloudiness
I think he thinks upon the savage bull
Tush fear not man well tip thy horns with gold
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee
As once Europa did at lusty Jove
When he would play the noble beast in love
Bull Jove sir had an amiable low
And some such strange bull leapd your fathers cow
And got a calf in that same noble feat
Much like to you for you have just his bleat
For this I owe you here comes other reckonings
Reenter ANTONIO with the Ladies masked
Which is the lady I must seize upon
This same is she and I do give you her
Why then shes mine Sweet let me see your face
No that you shall not till you take her hand
Before this friar and swear to marry her
Give me your hand before this holy friar
I am your husband if you like of me
And when I lived I was your other wife
Unmasking
And when you loved you were my other husband
Another Hero
Nothing certainer
One Hero died defiled but I do live
And surely as I live I am a maid
The former Hero Hero that is dead
She died my lord but whiles her slander lived
All this amazement can I qualify
When after that the holy rites are ended
Ill tell you largely of fair Heros death
Meantime let wonder seem familiar
And to the chapel let us presently
Soft and fair friar Which is Beatrice
Unmasking  I answer to that name What is your will
Do not you love me
Why no no more than reason
Why then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
Have been deceived they swore you did
Do not you love me
Troth no no more than reason
Why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
Are much deceived for they did swear you did
They swore that you were almost sick for me
They swore that you were wellnigh dead for me
Tis no such matter Then you do not love me
No truly but in friendly recompense
Come cousin I am sure you love the gentleman
And Ill be sworn upont that he loves her
For heres a paper written in his hand
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain
Fashiond to Beatrice
And heres another
Writ in my cousins hand stolen from her pocket
Containing her affection unto Benedick
A miracle heres our own hands against our hearts
Come I will have thee but by this light I take
thee for pity
I would not deny you but by this good day I yield
upon great persuasion and partly to save your life
for I was told you were in a consumption
Peace I will stop your mouth
Kissing her
How dost thou Benedick the married man
Ill tell thee what prince a college of
witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour Dost
thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram No
if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear
nothing handsome about him In brief since I do
purpose to marry I will think nothing to any
purpose that the world can say against it and
therefore never flout at me for what I have said
against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my
conclusion For thy part Claudio I did think to
have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my
kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice
that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
life to make thee a doubledealer which out of
question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look
exceedingly narrowly to thee
Come come we are friends lets have a dance ere
we are married that we may lighten our own hearts
and our wives heels
Well have dancing afterward
First of my word therefore play music Prince
thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn
Enter a Messenger
My lord your brother John is taen in flight
And brought with armed men back to Messina
Think not on him till tomorrow
Ill devise thee brave punishments for him
Strike up pipers
Dance
Exeunt
Enter RODERIGO and IAGO
Tush never tell me I take it much unkindly
That thou Iago who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
Sblood but you will not hear me
If ever I did dream of such a matter Abhor me
Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate
Despise me if I do not Three great ones of the city
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant
Offcappd to him and by the faith of man
I know my price I am worth no worse a place
But he as loving his own pride and purposes
Evades them with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuffd with epithets of war
And in conclusion
Nonsuits my mediators for Certes says he
I have already chose my officer
And what was he
Forsooth a great arithmetician
One Michael Cassio a Florentine
A fellow almost damnd in a fair wife
That never set a squadron in the field
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
Is all his soldiership But he sir had the election
And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen must be beleed and calmd
By debitor and creditor this countercaster
He in good time must his lieutenant be
And IGod bless the markhis Moorships ancient
By heaven I rather would have been his hangman
Why theres no remedy tis the curse of service
Preferment goes by letter and affection
And not by old gradation where each second
Stood heir to the first Now sir be judge yourself
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor
I would not follow him then
O sir content you
I follow him to serve my turn upon him
We cannot all be masters nor all masters
Cannot be truly followd You shall mark
Many a duteous and kneecrooking knave
That doting on his own obsequious bondage
Wears out his time much like his masters ass
For nought but provender and when hes old cashierd
Whip me such honest knaves Others there are
Who trimmd in forms and visages of duty
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
And throwing but shows of service on their lords
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats
Do themselves homage these fellows have some soul
And such a one do I profess myself For sir
It is as sure as you are Roderigo
Were I the Moor I would not be Iago
In following him I follow but myself
Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty
But seeming so for my peculiar end
In compliment extern tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at I am not what I am
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
If he can carryt thus
Call up her father
Rouse him make after him poison his delight
Proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
And though he in a fertile climate dwell
Plague him with flies though that his joy be joy
Yet throw such changes of vexation ont
As it may lose some colour
Here is her fathers house Ill call aloud
Do with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when by night and negligence the fire
Is spied in populous cities
What ho Brabantio Signior Brabantio ho
Awake what ho Brabantio thieves thieves thieves
Look to your house your daughter and your bags
Thieves thieves
BRABANTIO appears above at a window
What is the reason of this terrible summons
What is the matter there
Signior is all your family within
Are your doors lockd
Why wherefore ask you this
Zounds sir youre robbd for shame put on
your gown
Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul
Even now now very now an old black ram
Is topping your white ewe Arise arise
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you
Arise I say
What have you lost your wits
Most reverend signior do you know my voice
Not Iwhat are you
My name is Roderigo
The worser welcome
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee and now in madness
Being full of supper and distempering draughts
Upon malicious bravery dost thou come
To start my quiet
Sir sir sir
But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee
Patience good sir
What tellst thou me of robbing this is Venice
My house is not a grange
Most grave Brabantio
In simple and pure soul I come to you
Zounds sir you are one of those that will not
serve God if the devil bid you Because we come to
do you service and you think we are ruffians youll
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse
youll have your nephews neigh to you youll have
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
What profane wretch art thou
I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs
Thou art a villain
You area senator
This thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo
Sir I will answer any thing But I beseech you
Ift be your pleasure and most wise consent
As partly I find it is that your fair daughter
At this oddeven and dull watch o the night
Transported with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire a gondolier
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor
If this be known to you and your allowance
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
But if you know not this my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke Do not believe
That from the sense of all civility
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence
Your daughter if you have not given her leave
I say again hath made a gross revolt
Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and every where Straight satisfy yourself
If she be in her chamber or your house
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you
Strike on the tinder ho
Give me a taper call up all my people
This accident is not unlike my dream
Belief of it oppresses me already
Light I say light
Exit above
Farewell for I must leave you
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
To be producedas if I stay I shall
Against the Moor for I do know the state
However this may gall him with some cheque
Cannot with safety cast him for hes embarkd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
Another of his fathom they have none
To lead their business in which regard
Though I do hate him as I do hellpains
Yet for necessity of present life
I must show out a flag and sign of love
Which is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search
And there will I be with him So farewell
Exit
Enter below BRABANTIO and Servants with torches
It is too true an evil gone she is
And whats to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness Now Roderigo
Where didst thou see her O unhappy girl
With the Moor sayst thou Who would be a father
How didst thou know twas she O she deceives me
Past thought What said she to you Get more tapers
Raise all my kindred Are they married think you
Truly I think they are
O heaven How got she out O treason of the blood
Fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused Have you not read Roderigo
Of some such thing
Yes sir I have indeed
Call up my brother O would you had had her
Some one way some another Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor
I think I can discover him if you please
To get good guard and go along with me
Pray you lead on At every house Ill call
I may command at most Get weapons ho
And raise some special officers of night
On good Roderigo Ill deserve your pains
Exeunt
Enter OTHELLO IAGO and Attendants with torches
Though in the trade of war I have slain men
Yet do I hold it very stuff o the conscience
To do no contrived murder I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service nine or ten times
I had thought to have yerkd him here under the ribs
Tis better as it is
Nay but he prated
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honour
That with the little godliness I have
I did full hard forbear him But I pray you sir
Are you fast married Be assured of this
That the magnifico is much beloved
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the dukes he will divorce you
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law with all his might to enforce it on
Will give him cable
Let him do his spite
My services which I have done the signiory
Shall outtongue his complaints Tis yet to know
Which when I know that boasting is an honour
I shall promulgateI fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reachd for know Iago
But that I love the gentle Desdemona
I would not my unhoused free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
For the seas worth But look what lights come yond
Those are the raised father and his friends
You were best go in
Not II must be found
My parts my title and my perfect soul
Shall manifest me rightly Is it they
By Janus I think no
Enter CASSIO and certain Officers with torches
The servants of the duke and my lieutenant
The goodness of the night upon you friends
What is the news
The duke does greet you general
And he requires your hasteposthaste appearance
Even on the instant
What is the matter think you
Something from Cyprus as I may divine
It is a business of some heat the galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one anothers heels
And many of the consuls raised and met
Are at the dukes already you have been
hotly calld for
When being not at your lodging to be found
The senate hath sent about three several guests
To search you out
Tis well I am found by you
I will but spend a word here in the house
And go with you
Exit
Ancient what makes he here
Faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack
If it prove lawful prize hes made for ever
I do not understand
Hes married
To who
Reenter OTHELLO
Marry toCome captain will you go
Have with you
Here comes another troop to seek for you
It is Brabantio General be advised
He comes to bad intent
Enter BRABANTIO RODERIGO and Officers with torches and weapons
Holla stand there
Signior it is the Moor
Down with him thief
They draw on both sides
You Roderigo come sir I am for you
Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
Good signior you shall more command with years
Than with your weapons
O thou foul thief where hast thou stowd my daughter
Damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
For Ill refer me to all things of sense
If she in chains of magic were not bound
Whether a maid so tender fair and happy
So opposite to marriage that she shunned
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation
Would ever have to incur a general mock
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
Judge me the world if tis not gross in sense
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion Ill havet disputed on
Tis probable and palpable to thinking
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant
Lay hold upon him if he do resist
Subdue him at his peril
Hold your hands
Both you of my inclining and the rest
Were it my cue to fight I should have known it
Without a prompter Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge
To prison till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer
What if I do obey
How may the duke be therewith satisfied
Whose messengers are here about my side
Upon some present business of the state
To bring me to him
Tis true most worthy signior
The dukes in council and your noble self
I am sure is sent for
How the duke in council
In this time of the night Bring him away
Mines not an idle cause the duke himself
Or any of my brothers of the state
Cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own
Bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be
Exeunt
The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table Officers attending
There is no composition in these news
That gives them credit
Indeed they are disproportiond
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys
And mine a hundred and forty
And mine two hundred
But though they jump not on a just account
As in these cases where the aim reports
Tis oft with differenceyet do they all confirm
A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus
Nay it is possible enough to judgment
I do not so secure me in the error
But the main article I do approve
In fearful sense
Within  What ho what ho what ho
A messenger from the galleys
Enter a Sailor
Now whats the business
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes
So was I bid report here to the state
By Signior Angelo
How say you by this change
This cannot be
By no assay of reason tis a pageant
To keep us in false gaze When we consider
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk
And let ourselves again but understand
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes
So may he with more facile question bear it
For that it stands not in such warlike brace
But altogether lacks the abilities
That Rhodes is dressd in if we make thought of this
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
To leave that latest which concerns him first
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
To wake and wage a danger profitless
Nay in all confidence hes not for Rhodes
Here is more news
Enter a Messenger
The Ottomites reverend and gracious
Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes
Have there injointed them with an after fleet
Ay so I thought How many as you guess
Of thirty sail and now they do restem
Their backward course bearing with frank appearance
Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
Your trusty and most valiant servitor
With his free duty recommends you thus
And prays you to believe him
Tis certain then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town
Hes now in Florence
Write from us to him postposthaste dispatch
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor
Enter BRABANTIO OTHELLO IAGO RODERIGO and Officers
Valiant Othello we must straight employ you
Against the general enemy Ottoman
To BRABANTIO
I did not see you welcome gentle signior
We lackd your counsel and your help tonight
So did I yours Good your grace pardon me
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
Take hold on me for my particular grief
Is of so floodgate and oerbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself
Why whats the matter
My daughter O my daughter
Dead
Ay to me
She is abused stoln from me and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
For nature so preposterously to err
Being not deficient blind or lame of sense
Sans witchcraft could not
Whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense yea though our proper son
Humbly I thank your grace
Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems
Your special mandate for the stateaffairs
Hath hither brought
We are very sorry fort
To OTHELLO  What in your own part can you say to this
Nothing but this is so
Most potent grave and reverend signiors
My very noble and approved good masters
That I have taen away this old mans daughter
It is most true true I have married her
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
And little blessd with the soft phrase of peace
For since these arms of mine had seven years pith
Till now some nine moons wasted they have used
And little of this great world can I speak
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience
I will a round unvarnishd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
What conjuration and what mighty magic
For such proceeding I am charged withal
I won his daughter
A maiden never bold
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
Blushd at herself and she in spite of nature
Of years of country credit every thing
To fall in love with what she feard to look on
It is a judgment maimd and most imperfect
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature and must be driven
Why this should be I therefore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful oer the blood
Or with some dram conjured to this effect
He wrought upon her
To vouch this is no proof
Without more wider and more overt test
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him
But Othello speak
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poison this young maids affections
Or came it by request and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth
I do beseech you
Send for the lady to the Sagittary
And let her speak of me before her father
If you do find me foul in her report
The trust the office I do hold of you
Not only take away but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life
Fetch Desdemona hither
Ancient conduct them you best know the place
Exeunt IAGO and Attendants
And till she come as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood
So justly to your grave ears Ill present
How I did thrive in this fair ladys love
And she in mine
Say it Othello
Her father loved me oft invited me
Still questiond me the story of my life
From year to year the battles sieges fortunes
That I have passed
I ran it through even from my boyish days
To the very moment that he bade me tell it
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances
Of moving accidents by flood and field
Of hairbreadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels history
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
It was my hint to speaksuch was the process
And of the Cannibals that each other eat
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline
But still the houseaffairs would draw her thence
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch
Sheld come again and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse which I observing
Took once a pliant hour and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate
Whereof by parcels she had something heard
But not intentively I did consent
And often did beguile her of her tears
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth sufferd My story being done
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs
She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
Twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful
She wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd
That heaven had made her such a man she thankd me
And bade me if I had a friend that loved her
I should but teach him how to tell my story
And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake
She loved me for the dangers I had passd
And I loved her that she did pity them
This only is the witchcraft I have used
Here comes the lady let her witness it
Enter DESDEMONA IAGO and Attendants
I think this tale would win my daughter too
Good Brabantio
Take up this mangled matter at the best
Men do their broken weapons rather use
Than their bare hands
I pray you hear her speak
If she confess that she was half the wooer
Destruction on my head if my bad blame
Light on the man Come hither gentle mistress
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience
My noble father
I do perceive here a divided duty
To you I am bound for life and education
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you you are the lord of duty
I am hitherto your daughter but heres my husband
And so much duty as my mother showd
To you preferring you before her father
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord
God be wi you I have done
Please it your grace on to the stateaffairs
I had rather to adopt a child than get it
Come hither Moor
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which but thou hast already with all my heart
I would keep from thee For your sake jewel
I am glad at soul I have no other child
For thy escape would teach me tyranny
To hang clogs on them I have done my lord
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
Which as a grise or step may help these lovers
Into your favour
When remedies are past the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes
The robbd that smiles steals something from the thief
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile
We lose it not so long as we can smile
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
These sentences to sugar or to gall
Being strong on both sides are equivocal
But words are words I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear
I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best
known to you and though we have there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a
sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
voice on you you must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
more stubborn and boisterous expedition
The tyrant custom most grave senators
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thricedriven bed of down I do agnise
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness and do undertake
These present wars against the Ottomites
Most humbly therefore bending to your state
I crave fit disposition for my wife
Due reference of place and exhibition
With such accommodation and besort
As levels with her breeding
If you please
Bet at her fathers
Ill not have it so
Nor I
Nor I I would not there reside
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye Most gracious duke
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
And let me find a charter in your voice
To assist my simpleness
What would You Desdemona
That I did love the Moor to live with him
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world my hearts subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord
I saw Othellos visage in his mind
And to his honour and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate
So that dear lords if I be left behind
A moth of peace and he go to the war
The rites for which I love him are bereft me
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence Let me go with him
Let her have your voices
Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not
To please the palate of my appetite
Nor to comply with heatthe young affects
But to be free and bounteous to her mind
And heaven defend your good souls that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me no when lightwingd toys
Of featherd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
My speculative and officed instruments
That my disports corrupt and taint my business
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm
And all indign and base adversities
Make head against my estimation
Be it as you shall privately determine
Either for her stay or going the affair cries haste
And speed must answer it
You must away tonight
With all my heart
At nine i the morning here well meet again
Othello leave some officer behind
And he shall our commission bring to you
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you
So please your grace my ancient
A man he is of honest and trust
To his conveyance I assign my wife
With what else needful your good grace shall think
To be sent after me
Let it be so
Good night to every one
To BRABANTIO
And noble signior
If virtue no delighted beauty lack
Your soninlaw is far more fair than black
Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well
Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see
She has deceived her father and may thee
Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE Senators Officers  and c
My life upon her faith Honest Iago
My Desdemona must I leave to thee
I prithee let thy wife attend on her
And bring them after in the best advantage
Come Desdemona I have but an hour
Of love of worldly matters and direction
To spend with thee we must obey the time
Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA
Iago
What sayst thou noble heart
What will I do thinkest thou
Why go to bed and sleep
I will incontinently drown myself
If thou dost I shall never love thee after Why
thou silly gentleman
It is silliness to live when to live is torment and
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
O villainous I have looked upon the world for four
times seven years and since I could distinguish
betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man
that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I
would drown myself for the love of a guineahen I
would change my humanity with a baboon
What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so
fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
Virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus
or thus Our bodies are our gardens to the which
our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant
nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up
thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or
with idleness or manured with industry why the
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
wills If the balance of our lives had not one
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions but we have
reason to cool our raging motions our carnal
stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that
you call love to be a sect or scion
It cannot be
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
the will Come be a man Drown thyself drown
cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
cables of perdurable toughness I could never
better stead thee than now Put money in thy
purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with
an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
love to the Moor put money in thy pursenor he
his to her it was a violent commencement and thou
shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but
money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in
their wills fill thy purse with moneythe food
that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida She must
change for youth when she is sated with his body
she will find the error of her choice she must
have change she must therefore put money in thy
purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a
more delicate way than drowning Make all the money
thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou
shalt enjoy her therefore make money A pox of
drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
to be drowned and go without her
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on
the issue
Thou art sure of mego make moneyI have told
thee often and I retell thee again and again I
hate the Moor my cause is hearted thine hath no
less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost
thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many
events in the womb of time which will be delivered
Traverse go provide thy money We will have more
of this tomorrow Adieu
Where shall we meet i the morning
At my lodging
Ill be with thee betimes
Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo
What say you
No more of drowning do you hear
I am changed Ill go sell all my land
Exit
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse
For I mine own gaind knowledge should profane
If I would time expend with such a snipe
But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor
And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
He has done my office I know not ift be true
But I for mere suspicion in that kind
Will do as if for surety He holds me well
The better shall my purpose work on him
Cassios a proper man let me see now
To get his place and to plume up my will
In double knaveryHow how Lets see
After some time to abuse Othellos ear
That he is too familiar with his wife
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected framed to make women false
The Moor is of a free and open nature
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are
I havet It is engenderd Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light
Exit
Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen
What from the cape can you discern at sea
Nothing at all it is a highwrought flood
I cannot twixt the heaven and the main
Descry a sail
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
A fuller blast neer shook our battlements
If it hath ruffiand so upon the sea
What ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
Can hold the mortise What shall we hear of this
A segregation of the Turkish fleet
For do but stand upon the foaming shore
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
The windshaked surge with high and monstrous mane
seems to cast water on the burning bear
And quench the guards of the everfixed pole
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood
If that the Turkish fleet
Be not enshelterd and embayd they are drownd
It is impossible they bear it out
Enter a third Gentleman
News lads our wars are done
The desperate tempest hath so bangd the Turks
That their designment halts a noble ship of Venice
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
On most part of their fleet
How is this true
The ship is here put in
A Veronesa Michael Cassio
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello
Is come on shore the Moor himself at sea
And is in full commission here for Cyprus
I am glad ont tis a worthy governor
But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort
Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly
And prays the Moor be safe for they were parted
With foul and violent tempest
Pray heavens he be
For I have served him and the man commands
Like a full soldier Lets to the seaside ho
As well to see the vessel thats come in
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
An indistinct regard
Come lets do so
For every minute is expectancy
Of more arrivance
Enter CASSIO
Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
That so approve the Moor O let the heavens
Give him defence against the elements
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea
Is he well shippd
His bark is stoutly timberd his pilot
Of very expert and approved allowance
Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
Stand in bold cure
A cry within A sail a sail a sail
Enter a fourth Gentleman
What noise
The town is empty on the brow o the sea
Stand ranks of people and they cry A sail
My hopes do shape him for the governor
Guns heard
They do discharge their shot of courtesy
Our friends at least
I pray you sir go forth
And give us truth who tis that is arrived
I shall
Exit
But good lieutenant is your general wived
Most fortunately he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener
Reenter second Gentleman
How now who has put in
Tis one Iago ancient to the general
Has had most favourable and happy speed
Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
The gutterd rocks and congregated sands
Traitors ensteepd to clog the guiltless keel
As having sense of beauty do omit
Their mortal natures letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona
What is she
She that I spake of our great captains captain
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A sennights speed Great Jove Othello guard
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship
Make loves quick pants in Desdemonas arms
Give renewd fire to our extincted spirits
And bring all Cyprus comfort
Enter DESDEMONA EMILIA IAGO RODERIGO and Attendants
O behold
The riches of the ship is come on shore
Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees
Hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven
Before behind thee and on every hand
Enwheel thee round
I thank you valiant Cassio
What tidings can you tell me of my lord
He is not yet arrived nor know I aught
But that hes well and will be shortly here
O but I fearHow lost you company
The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowshipBut hark a sail
Within A sail a sail Guns heard
They give their greeting to the citadel
This likewise is a friend
See for the news
Exit Gentleman
Good ancient you are welcome
To EMILIA
Welcome mistress
Let it not gall your patience good Iago
That I extend my manners tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy
Kissing her
Sir would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me
Youll have enough
Alas she has no speech
In faith too much
I find it still when I have list to sleep
Marry before your ladyship I grant
She puts her tongue a little in her heart
And chides with thinking
You have little cause to say so
Come on come on you are pictures out of doors
Bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens
Saints m your injuries devils being offended
Players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
O fie upon thee slanderer
Nay it is true or else I am a Turk
You rise to play and go to bed to work
You shall not write my praise
No let me not
What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
praise me
O gentle lady do not put me tot
For I am nothing if not critical
Come on assay Theres one gone to the harbour
Ay madam
I am not merry but I do beguile
The thing I am by seeming otherwise
Come how wouldst thou praise me
I am about it but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize
It plucks out brains and all but my Muse labours
And thus she is deliverd
If she be fair and wise fairness and wit
The ones for use the other useth it
Well praised How if she be black and witty
If she be black and thereto have a wit
Shell find a white that shall her blackness fit
Worse and worse
How if fair and foolish
She never yet was foolish that was fair
For even her folly helpd her to an heir
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i
the alehouse What miserable praise hast thou for
her thats foul and foolish
Theres none so foul and foolish thereunto
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
O heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed one that in the authority of her
merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
She that was ever fair and never proud
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud
Never lackd gold and yet went never gay
Fled from her wish and yet said Now I may
She that being angerd her revenge being nigh
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
She that in wisdom never was so frail
To change the cods head for the salmons tail
She that could think and neer disclose her mind
See suitors following and not look behind
She was a wight if ever such wight were
To do what
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer
O most lame and impotent conclusion Do not learn
of him Emilia though he be thy husband How say
you Cassio is he not a most profane and liberal
counsellor
He speaks home madam You may relish him more in
the soldier than in the scholar
Aside  He takes her by the palm ay well said
whisper with as little a web as this will I
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon
her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship
You say true tis so indeed if such tricks as
these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
oft which now again you are most apt to play the
sir in Very good well kissed an excellent
courtesy tis so indeed Yet again your fingers
to your lips would they were clysterpipes for your sake
Trumpet within
The Moor I know his trumpet
Tis truly so
Lets meet him and receive him
Lo where he comes
Enter OTHELLO and Attendants
O my fair warrior
My dear Othello
It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me O my souls joy
If after every tempest come such calms
May the winds blow till they have wakend death
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
Olympushigh and duck again as low
As hells from heaven If it were now to die
Twere now to be most happy for I fear
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate
The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase
Even as our days do grow
Amen to that sweet powers
I cannot speak enough of this content
It stops me here it is too much of joy
And this and this the greatest discords be
Kissing her
That eer our hearts shall make
Aside  O you are well tuned now
But Ill set down the pegs that make this music
As honest as I am
Come let us to the castle
News friends our wars are done the Turks
are drownd
How does my old acquaintance of this isle
Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus
I have found great love amongst them O my sweet
I prattle out of fashion and I dote
In mine own comforts I prithee good Iago
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers
Bring thou the master to the citadel
He is a good one and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect Come Desdemona
Once more well met at Cyprus
Exeunt OTHELLO DESDEMONA and Attendants
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come
hither If thou best valiant as they say base
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to themlist me The
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guardfirst I must tell thee thisDesdemona is
directly in love with him
With him why tis not possible
Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies
and will she love him still for prating let not
thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed
and what delight shall she have to look on the
sport there should be again to inflame it and to
give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour
sympathy in years manners and beauties all which
the Moor is defective in now for want of these
required conveniences her delicate tenderness will
find itself abused begin to heave the gorge
disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice Now sir this grantedas it is a most
pregnant and unforced positionwho stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
does a knave very voluble no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming for the better compassing
of his salt and most hidden loose affection why
none why none a slipper and subtle knave a
finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages though true advantage never
present itself a devilish knave Besides the
knave is handsome young and hath all those
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after a pestilent complete knave and the woman
hath found him already
I cannot believe that in her shes full of
most blessed condition
Blessed figsend the wine she drinks is made of
grapes if she had been blessed she would never
have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst
not mark that
Yes that I did but that was but courtesy
Lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue
to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together Villanous thoughts Roderigo when these
mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes
the master and main exercise the incorporate
conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I
have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight
for the command Ill layt upon you Cassio knows
you not Ill not be far from you do you find
some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking
too loud or tainting his discipline or from what
other course you please which the time shall more
favourably minister
Well
Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply
may strike at you provoke him that he may for
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means I shall then have to prefer them and the
impediment most profitably removed without the
which there were no expectation of our prosperity
I will do this if I can bring it to any
opportunity
I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel
I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell
Adieu
Exit
That Cassio loves her I do well believe it
That she loves him tis apt and of great credit
The Moor howbeit that I endure him not
Is of a constant loving noble nature
And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband Now I do love her too
Not out of absolute lust though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin
But partly led to diet my revenge
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leapd into my seat the thought whereof
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am evend with him wife for wife
Or failing so yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgment cannot cure Which thing to do
If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash
For his quick hunting stand the putting on
Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too
Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me
For making him egregiously an ass
Even to madness Tis here but yet confused
Knaverys plain face is never seen tin used
Exit
Enter a Herald with a proclamation People following
It is Othellos pleasure our noble and valiant
general that upon certain tidings now arrived
importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet
every man put himself into triumph some to dance
some to make bonfires each man to what sport and
revels his addiction leads him for besides these
beneficial news it is the celebration of his
nuptial So much was his pleasure should be
proclaimed All offices are open and there is full
liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the
isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
Exeunt
Enter OTHELLO DESDEMONA CASSIO and Attendants
Good Michael look you to the guard tonight
Lets teach ourselves that honourable stop
Not to outsport discretion
Iago hath direction what to do
But notwithstanding with my personal eye
Will I look tot
Iago is most honest
Michael good night tomorrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you
To DESDEMONA
Come my dear love
The purchase made the fruits are to ensue
That profits yet to come tween me and you
Good night
Exeunt OTHELLO DESDEMONA and Attendants
Enter IAGO
Welcome Iago we must to the watch
Not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the
clock Our general cast us thus early for the love
of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and
she is sport for Jove
Shes a most exquisite lady
And Ill warrant her fun of game
Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature
What an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of
provocation
An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
She is indeed perfection
Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I
have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello
Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment
O they are our friends but one cup Ill drink for
you
I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was
craftily qualified too and behold what innovation
it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity
and dare not task my weakness with any more
What man tis a night of revels the gallants
desire it
Where are they
Here at the door I pray you call them in
Ill dot but it dislikes me
Exit
If I can fasten but one cup upon him
With that which he hath drunk tonight already
Hell be as full of quarrel and offence
As my young mistress dog Now my sick fool Roderigo
Whom love hath turnd almost the wrong side out
To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
Potations pottledeep and hes to watch
Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits
That hold their honours in a wary distance
The very elements of this warlike isle
Have I tonight flusterd with flowing cups
And they watch too Now mongst this flock of drunkards
That may offend the isleBut here they come
If consequence do but approve my dream
My boat sails freely both with wind and stream
Reenter CASSIO with him MONTANO and Gentlemen servants following with wine
Fore God they have given me a rouse already
Good faith a little one not past a pint as I am
a soldier
Some wine ho
Sings
And let me the canakin clink clink
And let me the canakin clink
A soldiers a man
A lifes but a span
Why then let a soldier drink
Some wine boys
Fore God an excellent song
I learned it in England where indeed they are
most potent in potting your Dane your German and
your swagbellied HollanderDrink hoare nothing
to your English
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking
Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead
drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain he
gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle
can be filled
To the health of our general
I am for it lieutenant and Ill do you justice
O sweet England
King Stephen was a worthy peer
His breeches cost him but a crown
He held them sixpence all too dear
With that he calld the tailor lown
He was a wight of high renown
And thou art but of low degree
Tis pride that pulls the country down
Then take thine auld cloak about thee
Some wine ho
Why this is a more exquisite song than the other
Will you heart again
No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
does those things Well Gods above all and there
be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
Its true good lieutenant
For mine own partno offence to the general nor
any man of qualityI hope to be saved
And so do I too lieutenant
Ay but by your leave not before me the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient Lets
have no more of this lets to our affairsForgive
us our sinsGentlemen lets look to our business
Do not think gentlemen I am drunk this is my
ancient this is my right hand and this is my left
I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and
speak well enough
Excellent well
Why very well then you must not think then that I am drunk
Exit
To the platform masters come lets set the watch
You see this fellow that is gone before
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction and do but see his vice
Tis to his virtue a just equinox
The one as long as the other tis pity of him
I fear the trust Othello puts him in
On some odd time of his infirmity
Will shake this island
But is he often thus
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep
Hell watch the horologe a double set
If drink rock not his cradle
It were well
The general were put in mind of it
Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
And looks not on his evils is not this true
Enter RODERIGO
Aside to him  How now Roderigo
I pray you after the lieutenant go
Exit RODERIGO
And tis great pity that the noble Moor
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity
So to the Moor
Not I for this fair island
I do love Cassio well and would do much
To cure him of this evilBut hark what noise
Cry within Help help
Reenter CASSIO driving in RODERIGO
You rogue you rascal
Whats the matter lieutenant
A knave teach me my duty
Ill beat the knave into a twiggen bottle
Beat me
Dost thou prate rogue
Striking RODERIGO
Nay good lieutenant
Staying him
I pray you sir hold your hand
Let me go sir
Or Ill knock you oer the mazzard
Come come

Drunk
They fight
Aside to RODERIGO  Away I say go out and cry a mutiny
Exit RODERIGO
Nay good lieutenantalas gentlemen
Help hoLieutenantsirMontanosir
Help mastersHeres a goodly watch indeed
Bell rings
Whos that which rings the bellDiablo ho
The town will rise Gods will lieutenant hold
You will be shamed for ever
Reenter OTHELLO and Attendants
What is the matter here
Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death
Faints
Hold for your lives
Hold ho LieutenantsirMontanogentlemen
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty
Hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame
Why how now ho from whence ariseth this
Are we turnd Turks and to ourselves do that
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites
For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
From her propriety What is the matter masters
Honest Iago that lookst dead with grieving
Speak who began this on thy love I charge thee
I do not know friends all but now even now
In quarter and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed and then but now
As if some planet had unwitted men
Swords out and tilting one at others breast
In opposition bloody I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds
Those legs that brought me to a part of it
How comes it Michael you are thus forgot
I pray you pardon me I cannot speak
Worthy Montano you were wont be civil
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure whats the matter
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a nightbrawler give me answer to it
Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
Your officer Iago can inform you
While I spare speech which something now
offends me
Of all that I do know nor know I aught
By me thats said or done amiss this night
Unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us
Now by heaven
My blood begins my safer guides to rule
And passion having my best judgment collied
Assays to lead the way if I once stir
Or do but lift this arm the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know
How this foul rout began who set it on
And he that is approved in this offence
Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth
Shall lose me What in a town of war
Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear
To manage private and domestic quarrel
In night and on the court and guard of safety
Tis monstrous Iago who begant
If partially affined or leagued in office
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth
Thou art no soldier
Touch me not so near
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general
Montano and myself being in speech
There comes a fellow crying out for help
And Cassio following him with determined sword
To execute upon him Sir this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause
Myself the crying fellow did pursue
Lest by his clamouras it so fell out
The town might fall in fright he swift of foot
Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
And Cassio high in oath which till tonight
I neer might say before When I came back
For this was briefI found them close together
At blow and thrust even as again they were
When you yourself did part them
More of this matter cannot I report
But men are men the best sometimes forget
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
As men in rage strike those that wish them best
Yet surely Cassio I believe received
From him that fled some strange indignity
Which patience could not pass
I know Iago
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee
But never more be officer of mine
Reenter DESDEMONA attended
Look if my gentle love be not raised up
Ill make thee an example
Whats the matter
Alls well now sweeting come away to bed
Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
Lead him off
To MONTANO who is led off
Iago look with care about the town
Come Desdemona tis the soldiers life
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO
What are you hurt lieutenant
Ay past all surgery
Marry heaven forbid
Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost
my reputation I have lost the immortal part of
myself and what remains is bestial My reputation
Iago my reputation
As I am an honest man I thought you had received
some bodily wound there is more sense in that than
in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition oft got without merit and lost without
deserving you have lost no reputation at all
unless you repute yourself such a loser What man
there are ways to recover the general again you
are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in
policy than in malice even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue
to him again and hes yours
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight so drunken and so
indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot
and squabble swagger swear and discourse
fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible
spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by
let us call thee devil
What was he that you followed with your sword What
had he done to you
I know not
Ist possible
I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly
a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains that we should with joy pleasance
revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
Why but you are now well enough how came you thus
recovered
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me
another to make me frankly despise myself
Come you are too severe a moraler as the time
the place and the condition of this country
stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen
but since it is as it is mend it for your own good
I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me
I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra
such an answer would stop them all To be now a
sensible man by and by a fool and presently a
beast O strange Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil
Come come good wine is a good familiar creature
if it be well used exclaim no more against it
And good lieutenant I think you think I love you
I have well approved it sir I drunk
You or any man living may be drunk at a time man
Ill tell you what you shall do Our generals wife
is now the general may say so in this respect for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and
graces confess yourself freely to her importune
her help to put you in your place again she is of
so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my
fortunes against any lay worth naming this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
You advise me well
I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here
You are in the right Good night lieutenant I
must to the watch
CASSIO Good night honest Iago
Exit
And whats he then that says I play the villain
When this advice is free I give and honest
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moor again For tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit shes framed as fruitful
As the free elements And then for her
To win the Moorweret to renounce his baptism
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin
His soul is so enfetterd to her love
That she may make unmake do what she list
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
Directly to his good Divinity of hell
When devils will the blackest sins put on
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows
As I do now for whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
Ill pour this pestilence into his ear
That she repeals him for her bodys lust
And by how much she strives to do him good
She shall undo her credit with the Moor
So will I turn her virtue into pitch
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all
Reenter RODERIGO
How now Roderigo
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that
hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is
almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well
cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall
have so much experience for my pains and so with
no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice
How poor are they that have not patience
What wound did ever heal but by degrees
Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft
And wit depends on dilatory time
Doest not go well Cassio hath beaten thee
And thou by that small hurt hast cashierd Cassio
Though other things grow fair against the sun
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
Content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning
Retire thee go where thou art billeted
Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter
Nay get thee gone
Exit RODERIGO
Two things are to be done
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress
Ill set her on
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife ay thats the way
Dull not device by coldness and delay
Exit
Enter CASSIO and some Musicians
Masters play here I will content your pains
Something thats brief and bid Good morrow general
Music
Enter Clown
Why masters have your instruments been in Naples
that they speak i the nose thus
How sir how
Are these I pray you windinstruments
Ay marry are they sir
O thereby hangs a tail
Whereby hangs a tale sir
Marry sir by many a windinstrument that I know
But masters heres money for you and the general
so likes your music that he desires you for loves
sake to make no more noise with it
Well sir we will not
If you have any music that may not be heard tot
again but as they say to hear music the general
does not greatly care
We have none such sir
Then put up your pipes in your bag for Ill away
go vanish into air away
Exeunt Musicians
Dost thou hear my honest friend
No I hear not your honest friend I hear you
Prithee keep up thy quillets Theres a poor piece
of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends
the generals wife be stirring tell her theres
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech
wilt thou do this
She is stirring sir if she will stir hither I
shall seem to notify unto her
Do good my friend
Exit Clown
Enter IAGO
In happy time Iago
You have not been abed then
Why no the day had broke
Before we parted I have made bold Iago
To send in to your wife my suit to her
Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access
Ill send her to you presently
And Ill devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way that your converse and business
May be more free
I humbly thank you fort
Exit IAGO
I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest
Enter EMILIA
Good morrow good Lieutenant I am sorry
For your displeasure but all will sure be well
The general and his wife are talking of it
And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again
Yet I beseech you
If you think fit or that it may be done
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone
Pray you come in
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely
I am much bound to you
Exeunt
Enter OTHELLO IAGO and Gentlemen
These letters give Iago to the pilot
And by him do my duties to the senate
That done I will be walking on the works
Repair there to me
Well my good lord Ill dot
This fortification gentlemen shall we seet
Well wait upon your lordship
Exeunt
Enter DESDEMONA CASSIO and EMILIA
Be thou assured good Cassio I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf
Good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband
As if the case were his
O thats an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were
Bounteous madam
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio
Hes never any thing but your true servant
I knowt I thank you You do love my lord
You have known him long and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance
Ay but lady
That policy may either last so long
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
Or breed itself so out of circumstance
That I being absent and my place supplied
My general will forget my love and service
Do not doubt that before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place assure thee
If I do vow a friendship Ill perform it
To the last article my lord shall never rest
Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience
His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
Ill intermingle every thing he does
With Cassios suit therefore be merry Cassio
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away
Madam here comes my lord
Madam Ill take my leave
Why stay and hear me speak
Madam not now I am very ill at ease
Unfit for mine own purposes
Well do your discretion
Exit CASSIO
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
Ha I like not that
What dost thou say
Nothing my lord or ifI know not what
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife
Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it
That he would steal away so guiltylike
Seeing you coming
I do believe twas he
How now my lord
I have been talking with a suitor here
A man that languishes in your displeasure
Who ist you mean
Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord
If I have any grace or power to move you
His present reconciliation take
For if he be not one that truly loves you
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning
I have no judgment in an honest face
I prithee call him back
Went he hence now
Ay sooth so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me
To suffer with him Good love call him back
Not now sweet Desdemona some other time
But shallt be shortly
The sooner sweet for you
Shallt be tonight at supper
No not tonight
Tomorrow dinner then
I shall not dine at home
I meet the captains at the citadel
Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn
On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn
I prithee name the time but let it not
Exceed three days in faith hes penitent
And yet his trespass in our common reason
Save that they say the wars must make examples
Out of their bestis not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque When shall he come
Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul
What you would ask me that I should deny
Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio
That came awooing with you and so many a time
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly
Hath taen your part to have so much to do
To bring him in Trust me I could do much
Prithee no more let him come when he will
I will deny thee nothing
Why this is not a boon
Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves
Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person nay when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted
I will deny thee nothing
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
To leave me but a little to myself
Shall I deny you no farewell my lord
Farewell my Desdemona Ill come to thee straight
Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you
Whateer you be I am obedient
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul
But I do love thee and when I love thee not
Chaos is come again
My noble lord
What dost thou say Iago
Did Michael Cassio when you wood my lady
Know of your love
He did from first to last why dost thou ask
No further harm
Why of thy thought Iago
I did not think he had been acquainted with her
O yes and went between us very oft
Indeed
Indeed ay indeed discernst thou aught in that
Is he not honest
Honest my lord
Honest ay honest
My lord for aught I know
What dost thou think
Think my lord
Think my lord
By heaven he echoes me
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something
I heard thee say even now thou likedst not that
When Cassio left my wife what didst not like
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me
Show me thy thought
My lord you know I love you
I think thou dost
And for I know thourt full of love and honesty
And weighst thy words before thou givest them breath
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just
They are close delations working from the heart
That passion cannot rule
For Michael Cassio
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest
I think so too
Men should be what they seem
Or those that be not would they might seem none
Certain men should be what they seem
Why then I think Cassios an honest man
Nay yet theres more in this
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words
Good my lord pardon me
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to
Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false
As wheres that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit
With meditations lawful
Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago
If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts
I do beseech you
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess
As I confess it is my natures plague
To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom yet
From one that so imperfectly conceits
Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance
It were not for your quiet nor your good
Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
To let you know my thoughts
What dost thou mean
Good name in man and woman dear my lord
Is the immediate jewel of their souls
Who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing
Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed
By heaven Ill know thy thoughts
You cannot if my heart were in your hand
Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody
Ha
O beware my lord of jealousy
It is the greeneyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss
Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
But O what damned minutes tells he oer
Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
O misery
Poor and content is rich and rich enough
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor
Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy
Why why is this
Thinkst thou Ild make a lie of jealousy
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions No to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises
Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
Is free of speech sings plays and dances well
Where virtue is these are more virtuous
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
For she had eyes and chose me No Iago
Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove
And on the proof there is no more but this
Away at once with love or jealousy
I am glad of it for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit therefore as I am bound
Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof
Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio
Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
I would not have your free and noble nature
Out of selfbounty be abused look tot
I know our country disposition well
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands their best conscience
Is not to leavet undone but keept unknown
Dost thou say so
She did deceive her father marrying you
And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks
She loved them most
And so she did
Why go to then
She that so young could give out such a seeming
To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak
He thought twas witchcraftbut I am much to blame
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you
I am bound to thee for ever
I see this hath a little dashd your spirits
Not a jot not a jot
I faith I fear it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love But I do see youre moved
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion
I will not
Should you do so my lord
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at Cassios my worthy friend
My lord I see youre moved
No not much moved
I do not think but Desdemonas honest
Long live she so and long live you to think so
And yet how nature erring from itself
Ay theres the point asto be bold with you
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime complexion and degree
Whereto we see in all things nature tends
Foh one may smell in such a will most rank
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
But pardon me I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her though I may fear
Her will recoiling to her better judgment
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent
Farewell farewell
If more thou dost perceive let me know more
Set on thy wife to observe leave me Iago
Going  My lord I take my leave
Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
Returning  My lord I would I might entreat
your honour
To scan this thing no further leave it to time
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place
For sure he fills it up with great ability
Yet if you please to hold him off awhile
You shall by that perceive him and his means
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity
Much will be seen in that In the mean time
Let me be thought too busy in my fears
As worthy cause I have to fear I am
And hold her free I do beseech your honour
Fear not my government
I once more take my leave
Exit
This fellows of exceeding honesty
And knows all qualities with a learned spirit
Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
Ild whistle her off and let her down the wind
To pray at fortune Haply for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have or for I am declined
Into the vale of yearsyet thats not much
Shes gone I am abused and my relief
Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage
That we can call these delicate creatures ours
And not their appetites I had rather be a toad
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others uses Yet tis the plague of great ones
Prerogatived are they less than the base
Tis destiny unshunnable like death
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken Desdemona comes
Reenter DESDEMONA and EMILIA
If she be false O then heaven mocks itself
Ill not believet
How now my dear Othello
Your dinner and the generous islanders
By you invited do attend your presence
I am to blame
Why do you speak so faintly
Are you not well
I have a pain upon my forehead here
Faith thats with watching twill away again
Let me but bind it hard within this hour
It will be well
Your napkin is too little
He puts the handkerchief from him and it drops
Let it alone Come Ill go in with you
I am very sorry that you are not well
Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA
I am glad I have found this napkin
This was her first remembrance from the Moor
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Wood me to steal it but she so loves the token
For he conjured her she should ever keep it
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to Ill have the work taen out
And givet Iago what he will do with it
Heaven knows not I
I nothing but to please his fantasy
Reenter Iago
How now what do you here alone
Do not you chide I have a thing for you
A thing for me it is a common thing
Ha
To have a foolish wife
O is that all What will you give me now
For the same handkerchief
What handkerchief
What handkerchief
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona
That which so often you did bid me steal
Hast stoln it from her
No faith she let it drop by negligence
And to the advantage I being here tookt up
Look here it is
A good wench give it me
What will you do with t that you have been
so earnest
To have me filch it
Snatching it  Why whats that to you
If it be not for some purpose of import
Givet me again poor lady shell run mad
When she shall lack it
Be not acknown on t I have use for it
Go leave me
Exit EMILIA
I will in Cassios lodging lose this napkin
And let him find it Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ this may do something
The Moor already changes with my poison
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste
Burn like the mines of Sulphur I did say so
Look where he comes
Reenter OTHELLO
Not poppy nor mandragora
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday
Ha ha false to me
Why how now general no more of that
Avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack
I swear tis better to be much abused
Than but to knowt a little
How now my lord
What sense had I of her stoln hours of lust
I sawt not thought it not it harmd not me
I slept the next night well was free and merry
I found not Cassios kisses on her lips
He that is robbd not wanting what is stoln
Let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all
I am sorry to hear this
I had been happy if the general camp
Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
So I had nothing known O now for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
That make ambition virtue O farewell
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife
The royal banner and all quality
Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
And O you mortal engines whose rude throats
The immortal Joves dead clamours counterfeit
Farewell Othellos occupations gone
Ist possible my lord
Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
Be sure of it give me the ocular proof
Or by the worth of mans eternal soul
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath
Ist come to this
Make me to seet or at the least so prove it
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
My noble lord
If thou dost slander her and torture me
Never pray more abandon all remorse
On horrors head horrors accumulate
Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that
O grace O heaven forgive me
Are you a man have you a soul or sense
God be wi you take mine office O wretched fool
That livest to make thine honesty a vice
O monstrous world Take note take note O world
To be direct and honest is not safe
I thank you for this profit and from hence
Ill love no friend sith love breeds such offence
Nay stay thou shouldst be honest
I should be wise for honestys a fool
And loses that it works for
By the world
I think my wife be honest and think she is not
I think that thou art just and think thou art not
Ill have some proof Her name that was as fresh
As Dians visage is now begrimed and black
As mine own face If there be cords or knives
Poison or fire or suffocating streams
Ill not endure it Would I were satisfied
I see sir you are eaten up with passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
You would be satisfied
Would nay I will
And may but how how satisfied my lord
Would you the supervisor grossly gape on
Behold her toppd
Death and damnation O
It were a tedious difficulty I think
To bring them to that prospect damn them then
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own What then how then
It is impossible you should see this
Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk But yet I say
If imputation and strong circumstances
Which lead directly to the door of truth
Give me a living reason shes disloyal
I do not like the office
But sith I am enterd in this cause so far
Prickd tot by foolish honesty and love
I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
And being troubled with a raging tooth
I could not sleep
There are a kind of men so loose of soul
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
One of this kind is Cassio
In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona
Let us be wary let us hide our loves
And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard
As if he pluckd up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips then laid his leg
Over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then
Cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor
O monstrous monstrous
Nay this was but his dream
But this denoted a foregone conclusion
Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly
Ill tear her all to pieces
Nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
She may be honest yet Tell me but this
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand
I gave her such a one twas my first gift
I know not that but such a handkerchief
I am sure it was your wifesdid I today
See Cassio wipe his beard with
If it be that
If it be that or any that was hers
It speaks against her with the other proofs
O that the slave had forty thousand lives
One is too poor too weak for my revenge
Now do I see tis true Look here Iago
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven
Tis gone
Arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell
Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught
For tis of aspics tongues
Yet be content
O blood blood blood
Patience I say your mind perhaps may change
Never Iago Like to the Pontic sea
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont
Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
Shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven
Kneels
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words
Do not rise yet
Kneels
Witness you everburning lights above
You elements that clip us round about
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit hands heart
To wrongd Othellos service Let him command
And to obey shall be in me remorse
What bloody business ever
They rise
I greet thy love
Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
And will upon the instant put thee tot
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That Cassios not alive
My friend is dead tis done at your request
But let her live
Damn her lewd minx O damn her
Come go with me apart I will withdraw
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant
I am your own for ever
Exeunt
Enter DESDEMONA EMILIA and Clown
Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies
I dare not say he lies any where
Why man
Hes a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies
is stabbing
Go to where lodges he
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie
Can any thing be made of this
I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were
to lie in mine own throat
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report
I will catechise the world for him that is make
questions and by them answer
Seek him bid him come hither tell him I have
moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
To do this is within the compass of mans wit and
therefore I will attempt the doing it
Exit
Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia
I know not madam
Believe me I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes and but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are it were enough
To put him to ill thinking
Is he not jealous
Who he I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him
Look where he comes
I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be calld to him
Enter OTHELLO
How ist with you my lord
Well my good lady
Aside
O hardness to dissemble
How do you Desdemona
Well my good lord
Give me your hand this hand is moist my lady
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
Hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
Much castigation exercise devout
For heres a young and sweating devil here
That commonly rebels Tis a good hand
A frank one
You may indeed say so
For twas that hand that gave away my heart
A liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands
But our new heraldry is hands not hearts
I cannot speak of this Come now your promise
What promise chuck
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
Lend me thy handkerchief
Here my lord
That which I gave you
I have it not about me
Not
No indeed my lord
That is a fault
That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give
She was a charmer and could almost read
The thoughts of people she told her while
she kept it
Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love but if she lost it
Or made gift of it my fathers eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies she dying gave it me
And bid me when my fate would have me wive
To give it her I did so and take heed ont
Make it a darling like your precious eye
To loset or givet away were such perdition
As nothing else could match
Ist possible
Tis true theres magic in the web of it
A sibyl that had numberd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses
In her prophetic fury sewd the work
The worms were hallowd that did breed the silk
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens hearts
Indeed ist true
Most veritable therefore look tot well
Then would to God that I had never seent
Ha wherefore
Why do you speak so startingly and rash
Ist lost ist gone speak is it out
o the way
Heaven bless us
Say you
It is not lost but what an if it were
How
I say it is not lost
Fetcht let me seet
Why so I can sir but I will not now
This is a trick to put me from my suit
Pray you let Cassio be received again
Fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
Come come
Youll never meet a more sufficient man
The handkerchief
I pray talk me of Cassio
The handkerchief
A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love
Shared dangers with you
The handkerchief
In sooth you are to blame
Away
Exit
Is not this man jealous
I neer saw this before
Sure theres some wonder in this handkerchief
I am most unhappy in the loss of it
Tis not a year or two shows us a man
They are all but stomachs and we all but food
To eat us hungerly and when they are full
They belch us Look you Cassio and my husband
Enter CASSIO and IAGO
There is no other way tis she must dot
And lo the happiness go and importune her
How now good Cassio whats the news with you
Madam my former suit I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour I would not be delayd
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past nor present sorrows
Nor purposed merit in futurity
Can ransom me into his love again
But to know so must be my benefit
So shall I clothe me in a forced content
And shut myself up in some other course
To fortunes alms
Alas thricegentle Cassio
My advocation is not now in tune
My lord is not my lord nor should I know him
Were he in favour as in humour alterd
So help me every spirit sanctified
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech you must awhile be patient
What I can do I will and more I will
Than for myself I dare let that suffice you
Is my lord angry
He went hence but now
And certainly in strange unquietness
Can he be angry I have seen the cannon
When it hath blown his ranks into the air
And like the devil from his very arm
Puffd his own brotherand can he be angry
Something of moment then I will go meet him
Theres matter int indeed if he be angry
I prithee do so
Exit IAGO
Something sure of state
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him
Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
Mens natures wrangle with inferior things
Though great ones are their object Tis even so
For let our finger ache and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain nay we must think men are not gods
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia
I was unhandsome warrior as I am
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul
But now I find I had subornd the witness
And hes indicted falsely
Pray heaven it be statematters as you think
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you
Alas the day I never gave him cause
But jealous souls will not be answerd so
They are not ever jealous for the cause
But jealous for they are jealous tis a monster
Begot upon itself born on itself
Heaven keep that monster from Othellos mind
Lady amen
I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout
If I do find him fit Ill move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost
I humbly thank your ladyship
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Enter BIANCA
Save you friend Cassio
What make you from home
How is it with you my most fair Bianca
I faith sweet love I was coming to your house
And I was going to your lodging Cassio
What keep a week away seven days and nights
Eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours
More tedious than the dial eight score times
O weary reckoning
Pardon me Bianca
I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressd
But I shall in a more continuate time
Strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca
Giving her DESDEMONAs handkerchief
Take me this work out
O Cassio whence came this
This is some token from a newer friend
To the felt absence now I feel a cause
Ist come to this Well well
Go to woman
Throw your vile guesses in the devils teeth
From whence you have them You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress some remembrance
No in good troth Bianca
Why whose is it
I know not sweet I found it in my chamber
I like the work well ere it be demanded
As like enough it willIld have it copied
Take it and dot and leave me for this time
Leave you wherefore
I do attend here on the general
And think it no addition nor my wish
To have him see me womand
Why I pray you
Not that I love you not
But that you do not love me
I pray you bring me on the way a little
And say if I shall see you soon at night
Tis but a little way that I can bring you
For I attend here but Ill see you soon
Tis very good I must be circumstanced
Exeunt
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
Will you think so
Think so Iago
What
To kiss in private
An unauthorized kiss
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more not meaning any harm
Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm
It is hypocrisy against the devil
They that mean virtuously and yet do so
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
So they do nothing tis a venial slip
But if I give my wife a handkerchief
What then
Why then tis hers my lord and being hers
She may I think bestowt on any man
She is protectress of her honour too
May she give that
Her honour is an essence thats not seen
They have it very oft that have it not
But for the handkerchief
By heaven I would most gladly have forgot it
Thou saidst it comes oer my memory
As doth the raven oer the infected house
Boding to allhe had my handkerchief
Ay what of that
Thats not so good now
What
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong
Or heard him sayas knaves be such abroad
Who having by their own importunate suit
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress
Convinced or supplied them cannot choose
But they must blab
Hath he said any thing
He hath my lord but be you well assured
No more than hell unswear
What hath he said
Faith that he didI know not what he did
What what
Lie
With her
With her on her what you will

confess and be hanged for his labourfirst to be
hanged and then to confessI tremble at it
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
passion without some instruction It is not words
that shake me thus Pish Noses ears and lips
Ist possibleConfesshandkerchiefO devil
Falls in a trance
Work on
My medicine work Thus credulous fools are caught
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus
All guiltless meet reproach What ho my lord
My lord I say Othello
Enter CASSIO
How now Cassio
Whats the matter
My lord is falln into an epilepsy
This is his second fit he had one yesterday
Rub him about the temples
No forbear
The lethargy must have his quiet course
If not he foams at mouth and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness Look he stirs
Do you withdraw yourself a little while
He will recover straight when he is gone
I would on great occasion speak with you
Exit CASSIO
How is it general have you not hurt your head
Dost thou mock me
I mock you no by heaven
Would you would bear your fortune like a man
A horned mans a monster and a beast
Theres many a beast then in a populous city
And many a civil monster
Did he confess it
Good sir be a man
Think every bearded fellow thats but yoked
May draw with you theres millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
O tis the spite of hell the fiends archmock
To lip a wanton in a secure couch
And to suppose her chaste No let me know
And knowing what I am I know what she shall be
O thou art wise tis certain
Stand you awhile apart
Confine yourself but in a patient list
Whilst you were here oerwhelmed with your grief
A passion most unsuiting such a man
Cassio came hither I shifted him away
And laid good scuse upon your ecstasy
Bade him anon return and here speak with me
The which he promised Do but encave yourself
And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
That dwell in every region of his face
For I will make him tell the tale anew
Where how how oft how long ago and when
He hath and is again to cope your wife
I say but mark his gesture Marry patience
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen
And nothing of a man
Dost thou hear Iago
I will be found most cunning in my patience
Butdost thou hearmost bloody
Thats not amiss
But yet keep time in all Will you withdraw
OTHELLO retires
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature
That dotes on Cassio as tis the strumpets plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one
He when he hears of her cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter Here he comes
Reenter CASSIO
As he shall smile Othello shall go mad
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassios smiles gestures and light behavior
Quite in the wrong How do you now lieutenant
The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me
Ply Desdemona well and you are sure ont
Speaking lower
Now if this suit lay in Biancos power
How quickly should you speed
Alas poor caitiff
Look how he laughs already
I never knew woman love man so
Alas poor rogue I think i faith she loves me
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
Do you hear Cassio
Now he importunes him
To tell it oer go to well said well said
She gives it out that you shall marry hey
Do you intend it
Ha ha ha
Do you triumph Roman do you triumph
I marry her what a customer Prithee bear some
charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome
Ha ha ha
So so so so they laugh that win
Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her
Prithee say true
I am a very villain else
Have you scored me Well
This is the monkeys own giving out she is
persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and
flattery not out of my promise
Iago beckons me now he begins the story
She was here even now she haunts me in every place
I was the other day talking on the seabank with
certain Venetians and thither comes the bauble
and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck
Crying O dear Cassio as it were his gesture
imports it
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales
and pulls me ha ha ha
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber O
I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall
throw it to
Well I must leave her company
Before me look where she comes
Tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one
Enter BIANCA
What do you mean by this haunting of me
Let the devil and his dam haunt you What did you
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now
I was a fine fool to take it I must take out the
workA likely piece of work that you should find
it in your chamber and not know who left it there
This is some minxs token and I must take out the
work There give it your hobbyhorse wheresoever
you had it Ill take out no work ont
How now my sweet Bianca how now how now
By heaven that should be my handkerchief

After her after her
Faith I must shell rail in the street else
Will you sup there
Faith I intend so
Well I may chance to see you for I would very fain
speak with you
Prithee come will you
Go to say no more
Exit CASSIO
Advancing  How shall I murder him Iago
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice
O Iago
And did you see the handkerchief
Was that mine
Yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the
foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he
hath given it his whore
I would have him nine years akilling
A fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman
Nay you must forget that
Ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight
for she shall not live no my heart is turned to
stone I strike it and it hurts my hand O the
world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by
an emperors side and command him tasks
Nay thats not your way
Hang her I do but say what she is so delicate
with her needle an admirable musician O she
will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high
and plenteous wit and invention
Shes the worse for all this
O a thousand thousand times and then of so
gentle a condition
Ay too gentle
Nay thats certain but yet the pity of it Iago
O Iago the pity of it Iago
If you are so fond over her iniquity give her
patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes
near nobody
I will chop her into messes cuckold me
O tis foul in her
With mine officer
Thats fouler
Get me some poison Iago this night Ill not
expostulate with her lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again this night Iago
Do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even
the bed she hath contaminated
Good good the justice of it pleases very good
And for Cassio let me be his undertaker you

Excellent good

A most unhappy one I would do much
To atone them for the love I bear to Cassio
Fire and brimstone
My lord
Are you wise

May be the letter moved him
For as I think they do command him home
Deputing Cassio in his government
Trust me I am glad ont
Indeed
My lord

Why sweet Othello
Striking her  Devil
I have not deserved this
My lord this would not be believed in Venice
Though I should swear I sawt tis very much

Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile
Out of my sight

You are welcome sir to CyprusGoats and monkeys
Exit
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
Call all in all sufficient Is this the nature
Whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue
The shot of accident nor dart of chance
Could neither graze nor pierce
He is much changed
Are his wits safe is he not light of brain
Hes that he is I may not breathe my censure
What he might be if what he might he is not
I would to heaven he were
What strike his wife
Faith that was not so well yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst
Is it his use
Or did the letters work upon his blood
And newcreate this fault
Alas alas
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known You shall observe him
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech do but go after
And mark how he continues
I am sorry that I am deceived in him
Exeunt
Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA
You have seen nothing then
Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
Yes you have seen Cassio and she together
But then I saw no harm and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them
What did they never whisper
Never my lord
Nor send you out o the way
Never
To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
Never my lord
Thats strange
I durst my lord to wager she is honest
Lay down my soul at stake if you think other
Remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
If any wretch have put this in your head
Let heaven requite it with the serpents curse
For if she be not honest chaste and true
Theres no man happy the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander
Bid her come hither go
Exit EMILIA
She says enough yet shes a simple bawd
That cannot say as much This is a subtle whore
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
And yet shell kneel and pray I have seen her dot
Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA
My lord what is your will
Pray chuck come hither
What is your pleasure
Let me see your eyes
Look in my face
What horrible fancys this
To EMILIA  Some of your function mistress
Leave procreants alone and shut the door
Cough or cry hem if any body come
Your mystery your mystery nay dispatch
Exit EMILIA
Upon my knees what doth your speech import
I understand a fury in your words
But not the words
Why what art thou
Your wife my lord your true
And loyal wife
Come swear it damn thyself
Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee therefore be double damnd
Swear thou art honest
Heaven doth truly know it
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
To whom my lord with whom how am I false
O Desdemona away away away
Alas the heavy day Why do you weep
Am I the motive of these tears my lord
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back
Lay not your blame on me If you have lost him
Why I have lost him too
Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction had they raind
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
Steepd me in poverty to the very lips
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience but alas to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at
Yet could I bear that too well very well
But there where I have garnerd up my heart
Where either I must live or bear no life
The fountain from the which my current runs
Or else dries up to be discarded thence
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in Turn thy complexion there
Patience thou young and roselippd cherubin
Ay there look grim as hell
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest
O ay as summer flies are in the shambles
That quicken even with blowing O thou weed
Who art so lovely fair and smellst so sweet
That the sense aches at thee would thou hadst
neer been born
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed
Was this fair paper this most goodly book
Made to write whore upon What committed
Committed O thou public commoner
I should make very forges of my cheeks
That would to cinders burn up modesty
Did I but speak thy deeds What committed
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
Is hushd within the hollow mine of earth
And will not hear it What committed
Impudent strumpet
By heaven you do me wrong
Are you not a strumpet
No as I am a Christian
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet I am none
What not a whore
No as I shall be saved
Ist possible
O heaven forgive us
I cry you mercy then
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello
Raising his voice
You mistress
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter
And keep the gate of hell
Reenter EMILIA
You you ay you
We have done our course theres money for your pains
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel
Exit
Alas what does this gentleman conceive
How do you madam how do you my good lady
Faith half asleep
Good madam whats the matter with my lord
With who
Why with my lord madam
Who is thy lord
He that is yours sweet lady
I have none do not talk to me Emilia
I cannot weep nor answer have I none
But what should go by water Prithee tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember
And call thy husband hither
Heres a change indeed
Exit
Tis meet I should be used so very meet
How have I been behaved that he might stick
The smallst opinion on my least misuse
Reenter EMILIA with IAGO
What is your pleasure madam
How ist with you
I cannot tell Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks
He might have chid me so for in good faith
I am a child to chiding
Whats the matter lady
Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
As true hearts cannot bear
Am I that name Iago
What name fair lady
Such as she says my lord did say I was
He calld her whore a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat
Why did he so
I do not know I am sure I am none such
Do not weep do not weep Alas the day
Hath she forsook so many noble matches
Her father and her country and her friends
To be calld whore would it not make one weep
It is my wretched fortune
Beshrew him fort
How comes this trick upon him
Nay heaven doth know
I will be hangd if some eternal villain
Some busy and insinuating rogue
Some cogging cozening slave to get some office
Have not devised this slander Ill be hangd else
Fie there is no such man it is impossible
If any such there be heaven pardon him
A halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones
Why should he call her whore who keeps her company
What place what time what form what likelihood
The Moors abused by some most villanous knave
Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
O heaven that such companions thouldst unfold
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west
Speak within door
O fie upon them Some such squire he was
That turnd your wit the seamy side without
And made you to suspect me with the Moor
You are a fool go to
O good Iago
What shall I do to win my lord again
Good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
I know not how I lost him Here I kneel
If eer my will did trespass gainst his love
Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
Delighted them in any other form
Or that I do not yet and ever did
And ever willthough he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcementlove him dearly
Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much
And his unkindness may defeat my life
But never taint my love I cannot say whore
It does abhor me now I speak the word
Not the worlds mass of vanity could make me
I pray you be content tis but his humour
The business of the state does him offence
And he does chide with you
If twere no other
Tis but so I warrant
Trumpets within
Hark how these instruments summon to supper
The messengers of Venice stay the meat
Go in and weep not all things shall be well
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Enter RODERIGO
How now Roderigo
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me
What in the contrary
Every day thou daffest me with some device Iago
and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope I will indeed no longer endure
it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already I have foolishly suffered
Will you hear me Roderigo
Faith I have heard too much for your words and
performances are no kin together
You charge me most unjustly
With nought but truth I have wasted myself out of
my means The jewels you have had from me to
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance but I find none
Well go to very well
Very well go to I cannot go to man nor tis
not very well nay I think it is scurvy and begin
to find myself fobbed in it
Very well
I tell you tis not very well I will make myself
known to Desdemona if she will return me my
jewels I will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself I
You have said now
Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing
Why now I see theres mettle in thee and even from
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before Give me thy hand Roderigo thou hast
taken against me a most just exception but yet I
protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair
It hath not appeared
I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment But
Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which I
have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean
purpose courage and valour this night show it if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona
take me from this world with treachery and devise
engines for my life
Well what is it is it within reason and compass
Sir there is especial commission come from Venice
to depute Cassio in Othellos place
Is that true why then Othello and Desdemona
return again to Venice
O no he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
him the fair Desdemona unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of Cassio
How do you mean removing of him
Why by making him uncapable of Othellos place
knocking out his brains
And that you would have me to do
Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
He sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will I
go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune If you will watch his going thence which
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one
you may take him at your pleasure I will be near
to second your attempt and he shall fall between
us Come stand not amazed at it but go along with
me I will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him It is now high suppertime and the night grows
to waste about it
I will hear further reason for this
And you shall be satisfied
Exeunt
Enter OTHELLO LODOVICO DESDEMONA EMILIA and Attendants
I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
O pardon me twill do me good to walk
Madam good night I humbly thank your ladyship
Your honour is most welcome
Will you walk sir
ODesdemona
My lord
Get you to bed on the instant I will be returned
forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done
I will my lord
Exeunt OTHELLO LODOVICO and Attendants
How goes it now he looks gentler than he did
He says he will return incontinent
He hath commanded me to go to bed
And bade me to dismiss you
Dismiss me
It was his bidding therefore good Emilia
Give me my nightly wearing and adieu
We must not now displease him
I would you had never seen him
So would not Imy love doth so approve him
That even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns
Prithee unpin mehave grace and favour in them
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
Alls one Good faith how foolish are our minds
If I do die before thee prithee shroud me
In one of those same sheets
Come come you talk
My mother had a maid calld Barbara
She was in love and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her she had a song of willow
An old thing twas but it expressd her fortune
And she died singing it that song tonight
Will not go from my mind I have much to do
But to go hang my head all at one side
And sing it like poor Barbara Prithee dispatch
Shall I go fetch your nightgown
No unpin me here
This Lodovico is a proper man
A very handsome man
He speaks well
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
Singing  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
Sing all a green willow
Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
Sing willow willow willow
The fresh streams ran by her and murmurd her moans
Sing willow willow willow
Her salt tears fell from her and softend the stones
Lay by these
Singing
Sing willow willow willow
Prithee hie thee hell come anon
Singing
Sing all a green willow must be my garland
Let nobody blame him his scorn I approve
Nay thats not nextHark who ist that knocks
Its the wind
Singing  I calld my love false love but what
said he then
Sing willow willow willow
If I court moe women youll couch with moe men
So get thee gone good night Ate eyes do itch
Doth that bode weeping
Tis neither here nor there
I have heard it said so O these men these men
Dost thou in conscience thinktell me Emilia
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind
There be some such no question
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
Why would not you
No by this heavenly light
Nor I neither by this heavenly light
I might dot as well i the dark
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
The worlds a huge thing it is a great price
For a small vice
In troth I think thou wouldst not
In troth I think I should and undot when I had
done Marry I would not do such a thing for a
jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for
gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty
exhibition but for the whole worldwhy who would
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch I should venture purgatory fort
Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world
Why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and
having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your
own world and you might quickly make it right
I do not think there is any such woman
Yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would
store the world they played for
But I do think it is their husbands faults
If wives do fall say that they slack their duties
And pour our treasures into foreign laps
Or else break out in peevish jealousies
Throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
Or scant our former having in despite
Why we have galls and though we have some grace
Yet have we some revenge Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour
As husbands have What is it that they do
When they change us for others Is it sport
I think it is and doth affection breed it
I think it doth ist frailty that thus errs
It is so too and have not we affections
Desires for sport and frailty as men have
Then let them use us well else let them know
The ills we do their ills instruct us so
Good night good night heaven me such uses send
Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
Exeunt
Enter IAGO and RODERIGO
Here stand behind this bulk straight will he come
Wear thy good rapier bare and put it home
Quick quick fear nothing Ill be at thy elbow
It makes us or it mars us think on that
And fix most firm thy resolution
Be near at hand I may miscarry int
Here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand
Retires
I have no great devotion to the deed
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons
Tis but a man gone Forth my sword he dies
I have rubbd this young quat almost to the sense
And he grows angry Now whether he kill Cassio
Or Cassio him or each do kill the other
Every way makes my gain live Roderigo
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobbd from him
As gifts to Desdemona
It must not be if Cassio do remain
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly and besides the Moor
May unfold me to him there stand I in much peril
No he must die But so I hear him coming
Enter CASSIO

Enter OTHELLO
It is the cause it is the cause my soul
Let me not name it to you you chaste stars
It is the cause Yet Ill not shed her blood
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
And smooth as monumental alabaster
Yet she must die else shell betray more men
Put out the light and then put out the light
If I quench thee thou flaming minister
I can again thy former light restore
Should I repent me but once put out thy light
Thou cunningst pattern of excelling nature
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume When I have pluckd the rose
I cannot give it vital growth again
It must needs wither Ill smell it on the tree
Kissing her
Ah balmy breath that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword One more one more
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee
And love thee after One more and this the last
So sweet was neer so fatal I must weep
But they are cruel tears this sorrows heavenly
It strikes where it doth love She wakes
Whos there Othello
Ay Desdemona
Will you come to bed my lord
Have you prayd tonight Desdemona
Ay my lord
If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
Solicit for it straight
Alas my lord what do you mean by that
Well do it and be brief I will walk by
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit
No heaven forfend I would not kill thy soul
Talk you of killing
Ay I do
Then heaven
Have mercy on me
Amen with all my heart
If you say so I hope you will not kill me
Hum
And yet I fear you for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so why I should fear I know not
Since guiltiness I know not but yet I feel I fear
Think on thy sins
They are loves I bear to you
Ay and for that thou diest
That deaths unnatural that kills for loving
Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame
These are portents but yet I hope I hope
They do not point on me
Peace and be still
I will so Whats the matter
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
Thou gavest to Cassio
No by my life and soul
Send for the man and ask him
Sweet soul take heed
Take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed
Ay but not yet to die
Yes presently
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal Thou art to die
Then Lord have mercy on me
I say amen
And have you mercy too I never did
Offend you in my life never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love I never gave him token
By heaven I saw my handkerchief ins hand
O perjured woman thou dost stone my heart
And makest me call what I intend to do
A murder which I thought a sacrifice
I saw the handkerchief
He found it then
I never gave it him send for him hither
Let him confess a truth
He hath confessd
What my lord
That he hath used thee
How unlawfully
Ay
He will not say so
No his mouth is stoppd
Honest Iago hath taen order fort
O my fear interprets what is he dead
Had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
Had stomach for them all
Alas he is betrayd and I undone
Out strumpet weepst thou for him to my face
O banish me my lord but kill me not
Down strumpet
Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
Nay if you strive
But half an hour
Being done there is no pause
But while I say one prayer
It is too late
He stifles her
Within  My lord  my lord what ho my lord my lord
What noise is this Not dead not yet quite dead
I that am cruel am yet merciful
I would not have thee linger in thy pain So so
Within  What ho my lord my lord
Whos there
Within  O good my lord I would speak a word with you
Yes tis Emilia By and by Shes dead
Tis like she comes to speak of Cassios death
The noise was here Ha no more moving
Still as the grave Shall she come in weret good
I think she stirs againno Whats best to do
If she come in shell sure speak to my wife
My wife my wife what wife I have no wife
O insupportable O heavy hour
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
Should yawn at alteration
Within  I do beseech you
That I may speak with you O good my lord
I had forgot thee O come in Emilia
Soft by and by Let me the curtains draw
Where art thou
Unlocks the door
Enter EMILIA
Whats the matter with thee now
O my good lord yonders foul murders done
What now
But now my lord
It is the very error of the moon
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont
And makes men mad
Cassio my lord hath killd a young Venetian
Calld Roderigo
Roderigo killd
And Cassio killd
No Cassio is not killd
Not Cassio killd then murders out of tune
And sweet revenge grows harsh
O falsely falsely murderd
Alas what cry is that
That what
Out and alas that was my ladys voice
Help help ho help O lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona O sweet mistress speak
A guiltless death I die
O who hath done this deed
Nobody I myself Farewell
Commend me to my kind lord O farewell
Dies
Why how should she be murderd
Alas who knows
You heard her say herself it was not I
She said so I must needs report the truth
Shes like a liar gone to burning hell
Twas I that killd her
O the more angel she
And you the blacker devil
She turnd to folly and she was a whore
Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
She was false as water
Thou art rash as fire to say
That she was false O she was heavenly true
Cassio did top her ask thy husband else
O I were damnd beneath all depth in hell
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity Thy husband knew it all
My husband
Thy husband
That she was false to wedlock
Ay with Cassio Nay had she been true
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite
Ild not have sold her for it
My husband
Ay twas he that told me first
An honest man he is and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds
My husband
What needs this iteration woman I say thy husband
O mistress villany hath made mocks with love
My husband say that she was false
He woman
I say thy husband dost understand the word
My friend thy husband honest honest Iago
If he say so may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain
Ha
Do thy worst
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her
Peace you were best
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt O gull O dolt
As ignorant as dirt thou hast done a deed
I care not for thy sword Ill make thee known
Though I lost twenty livesHelp help ho help
The Moor hath killd my mistress Murder murder
Enter MONTANO GRATIANO IAGO and others
What is the matter How now general
O are you come Iago you have done well
That men must lay their murders on your neck
What is the matter
Disprove this villain if thou best a man
He says thou toldst him that his wife was false
I know thou didst not thourt not such a villain
Speak for my heart is full
I told him what I thought and told no more
Than what he found himself was apt and true
But did you ever tell him she was false
I did
You told a lie an odious damned lie
Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
She false with Cassiodid you say with Cassio
With Cassio mistress Go to charm your tongue
I will not charm my tongue I am bound to speak
My mistress here lies murderd in her bed
O heavens forfend
And your reports have set the murder on
Nay stare not masters it is true indeed
Tis a strange truth
Villany villany villany
I think upont I think I smellt O villany
I thought so thenIll kill myself for grief
O villany villany
What are you mad I charge you get you home
Good gentlemen let me have leave to speak
Tis proper I obey him but not now
Perchance Iago I will neer go home
O O O
He falls on the bed
Nay lay thee down and roar
For thou hast killd the sweetest innocent
That eer did lift up eye
Rising  O she was foul
I scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece
Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stoppd
Poor Desdemona I am glad thy fathers dead
Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
Shore his old thread in twain did he live now
This sight would make him do a desperate turn
Yea curse his better angel from his side
And fall to reprobation
Tis pitiful but yet Iago knows
A thousand times committed Cassio confessd it
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
Which I first gave her I saw it in his hand
It was a handkerchief an antique token
My father gave my mother
O heaven O heavenly powers
Come hold your peace
Twill out twill out I peace
No I will speak as liberal as the north
Let heaven and men and devils let them all
All all cry shame against me yet Ill speak
Be wise and get you home
I will not
IAGO offers to stab EMILIA
Fie
Your sword upon a woman
O thou dull Moor that handkerchief thou speakst of
I found by fortune and did give my husband
For often with a solemn earnestness
More than indeed belongd to such a trifle
He beggd of me to steal it
Villanous whore
She give it Cassio no alas I found it
And I did givet my husband
Filth thou liest
By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen
O murderous coxcomb what should such a fool
Do with so good a woman
Are there no stones in heaven
But what serve for the thunderPrecious villain
He runs at IAGO  IAGO from behind stabs EMILIA and exit
The woman falls sure he hath killd his wife
Ay ay O lay me by my mistress side
Hes gone but his wifes killd
Tis a notorious villain Take you this weapon
Which I have here recoverd from the Moor
Come guard the door without let him not pass
But kill him rather Ill after that same villain
For tis a damned slave
Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO
I am not valiant neither
But ever puny whipster gets my sword
But why should honour outlive honesty
Let it go all
What did thy song bode lady
Hark canst thou hear me I will play the swan
And die in music
Singing
Willow willow willow
Moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel Moor
So come my soul to bliss as I speak true
So speaking as I think I die I die
Dies
I have another weapon in this chamber
It is a sword of Spain the icebrooks temper
O here it is Uncle I must come forth
Within  If thou attempt it it will cost thee dear
Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer
Look in upon me then and speak with me
Or naked as I am I will assault thee
Reenter GRATIANO
What is the matter
Behold I have a weapon
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldiers thigh I have seen the day
That with this little arm and this good sword
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop but O vain boast
Who can control his fate tis not so now
Be not afraid though you do see me weapond
Here is my journeys end here is my butt
And very seamark of my utmost sail
Do you go back dismayd tis a lost fear
Man but a rush against Othellos breast
And he retires Where should Othello go
Now how dost thou look now O illstarrd wench
Pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
And fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl
Even like thy chastity O cursed slave
Whip me ye devils
From the possession of this heavenly sight
Blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur
Wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire
O Desdemona Desdemona dead
Oh Oh Oh
Enter LODOVICO MONTANO CASSIO carried in a chair and Officers with IAGO prisoner
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man
Thats he that was Othello here I am
Where is that viper bring the villain forth
I look down towards his feet but thats a fable
If that thou best a devil I cannot kill thee
Wounds IAGO
Wrench his sword from him
I bleed sir but not killd
I am not sorry neither Ild have thee live
For in my sense tis happiness to die
O thou Othello thou wert once so good
What shall be said to thee
Why any thing
An honourable murderer if you will
For nought I did in hate but all in honour
This wretch hath part confessd his villany
Did you and he consent in Cassios death
Ay
Dear general I never gave you cause
I do believe it and I ask your pardon
Will you I pray demand that demidevil
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
Demand me nothing what you know you know
From this time forth I never will speak word
What not to pray
Torments will ope your lips
Well thou dost best
Sir you shall understand what hath befalln
Which as I think you know not Here is a letter
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo
And here another the one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo
O villain
Most heathenish and most gross
Now heres another discontented paper
Found in his pocket too and this it seems
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
But that belike Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him
O the pernicious caitiff
How came you Cassio by that handkerchief
That was my wifes
I found it in my chamber
And he himself confessd but even now
That there he droppd it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire
O fool fool fool
There is besides in Roderigos letter
How he upbraids Iago that he made him
Brave me upon the watch whereon it came
That I was cast and even but now he spake
After long seeming dead Iago hurt him
Iago set him on
You must forsake this room and go with us
Your power and your command is taken off
And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave
If there be any cunning cruelty
That can torment him much and hold him long
It shall be his You shall close prisoner rest
Till that the nature of your fault be known
To the Venetian state Come bring him away
Soft you a word or two before you go
I have done the state some service and they knowt
No more of that I pray you in your letters
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate
Speak of me as I am nothing extenuate
Nor set down aught in malice then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well
Of one not easily jealous but being wrought
Perplexd in the extreme of one whose hand
Like the base Indian threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
Albeit unused to the melting mood
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum Set you down this
And say besides that in Aleppo once
Where a malignant and a turband Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state
I took by the throat the circumcised dog
And smote him thus
Stabs himself
O bloody period
All thats spoke is marrd
I kissd thee ere I killd thee no way but this
Killing myself to die upon a kiss
Falls on the bed and dies
This did I fear but thought he had no weapon
For he was great of heart
To IAGO  O Spartan dog
More fell than anguish hunger or the sea
Look on the tragic loading of this bed
This is thy work the object poisons sight
Let it be hid Gratiano keep the house
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor
For they succeed on you To you lord governor
Remains the censure of this hellish villain
The time the place the torture O enforce it
Myself will straight aboard and to the state
Exeunt
PROLOGUE
Enter GOWER
Before the palace of Antioch
To sing a song that old was sung
From ashes ancient Gower is come
Assuming mans infirmities
To glad your ear and please your eyes
It hath been sung at festivals
On embereves and holyales
And lords and ladies in their lives
Have read it for restoratives
The purchase is to make men glorious
Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius
If you born in these latter times
When wits more ripe accept my rhymes
And that to hear an old man sing
May to your wishes pleasure bring
I life would wish and that I might
Waste it for you like taperlight
This Antioch then Antiochus the Great
Built up this city for his chiefest seat
The fairest in all Syria
I tell you what mine authors say
This king unto him took a fere
Who died and left a female heir
So buxom blithe and full of face
As heaven had lent her all his grace
With whom the father liking took
And her to incest did provoke
Bad child worse father to entice his own
To evil should be done by none
But custom what they did begin
Was with long use account no sin
The beauty of this sinful dame
Made many princes thither frame
To seek her as a bedfellow
In marriagepleasures playfellow
Which to prevent he made a law
To keep her still and men in awe
That whoso askd her for his wife
His riddle told not lost his life
So for her many a wight did die
As yon grim looks do testify
What now ensues to the judgment of your eye
I give my cause who best can justify
Exit
Enter ANTIOCHUS Prince PERICLES and followers
Young prince of Tyre you have at large received
The danger of the task you undertake
I have Antiochus and with a soul
Emboldend with the glory of her praise
Think death no hazard in this enterprise
Bring in our daughter clothed like a bride
For the embracements even of Jove himself
At whose conception till Lucina reignd
Nature this dowry gave to glad her presence
The senatehouse of planets all did sit
To knit in her their best perfections
Music Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
See where she comes apparelld like the spring
Graces her subjects and her thoughts the king
Of every virtue gives renown to men
Her face the book of praises where is read
Nothing but curious pleasures as from thence
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
Could never be her mild companion
You gods that made me man and sway in love
That have inflamed desire in my breast
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree
Or die in the adventure be my helps
As I am son and servant to your will
To compass such a boundless happiness
Prince Pericles
That would be son to great Antiochus
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides
With golden fruit but dangerous to be touchd
For deathlike dragons here affright thee hard
Her face like heaven enticeth thee to view
Her countless glory which desert must gain
And which without desert because thine eye
Presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die
Yon sometimes famous princes like thyself
Drawn by report adventurous by desire
Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale
That without covering save yon field of stars
Here they stand martyrs slain in Cupids wars
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
For going on deaths net whom none resist
Antiochus I thank thee who hath taught
My frail mortality to know itself
And by those fearful objects to prepare
This body like to them to what I must
For death rememberd should be like a mirror
Who tells us lifes but breath to trust it error
Ill make my will then and as sick men do
Who know the world see heaven but feeling woe
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did
So I bequeath a happy peace to you
And all good men as every prince should do
My riches to the earth from whence they came
But my unspotted fire of love to you
To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
Thus ready for the way of life or death
I wait the sharpest blow Antiochus
Scorning advice read the conclusion then
Which read and not expounded tis decreed
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed
Of all sayd yet mayst thou prove prosperous
Of all sayd yet I wish thee happiness
Like a bold champion I assume the lists
Nor ask advice of any other thought
But faithfulness and courage
He reads the riddle
I am no viper yet I feed
On mothers flesh which did me breed
I sought a husband in which labour
I found that kindness in a father
Hes father son and husband mild
I mother wife and yet his child
How they may be and yet in two
As you will live resolve it you
Sharp physic is the last but O you powers
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually
If this be true which makes me pale to read it
Fair glass of light I loved you and could still
Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill
But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt
For hes no man on whom perfections wait
That knowing sin within will touch the gate
You are a fair viol and your sense the strings
Who fingerd to make man his lawful music
Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken
But being playd upon before your time
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime
Good sooth I care not for you
Prince Pericles touch not upon thy life
For thats an article within our law
As dangerous as the rest Your times expired
Either expound now or receive your sentence
Great king
Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it
Who has a book of all that monarchs do
Hes more secure to keep it shut than shown
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind
Blows dust in others eyes to spread itself
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear
The breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear
To stop the air would hurt them The blind mole casts
Coppd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throngd
By mans oppression and the poor worm doth die fort
Kings are earths gods in vice their laws
their will
And if Jove stray who dares say Jove doth ill
It is enough you know and it is fit
What being more known grows worse to smother it
All love the womb that their first being bred
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head
Aside  Heaven that I had thy head he has found
the meaning
But I will gloze with himYoung prince of Tyre
Though by the tenor of our strict edict
Your exposition misinterpreting
We might proceed to cancel of your days
Yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree
As your fair self doth tune us otherwise
Forty days longer we do respite you
If by which time our secret be undone
This mercy shows well joy in such a son
And until then your entertain shall be
As doth befit our honour and your worth
Exeunt all but PERICLES
How courtesy would seem to cover sin
When what is done is like an hypocrite
The which is good in nothing but in sight
If it be true that I interpret false
Then were it certain you were not so bad
As with foul incest to abuse your soul
Where now youre both a father and a son
By your untimely claspings with your child
Which pleasure fits an husband not a father
And she an eater of her mothers flesh
By the defiling of her parents bed
And both like serpents are who though they feed
On sweetest flowers yet they poison breed
Antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men
Will shun no course to keep them from the light
One sin I know another doth provoke
Murders as near to lust as flame to smoke
Poison and treason are the hands of sin
Ay and the targets to put off the shame
Then lest my lie be croppd to keep you clear
By flight Ill shun the danger which I fear
Exit
Reenter ANTIOCHUS
He hath found the meaning for which we mean
To have his head
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
In such a loathed manner
And therefore instantly this prince must die
For by his fall my honour must keep high
Who attends us there
Enter THALIARD
Doth your highness call
Thaliard
You are of our chamber and our mind partakes
And for your faithfulness we will advance you
Thaliard behold heres poison and heres gold
We hate the prince of Tyre and thou must kill him
It fits thee not to ask the reason why
Because we bid it Say is it done
My lord
Tis done
Enough
Enter a Messenger
Let your breath cool yourself telling your haste
My lord prince Pericles is fled
Exit
As thou
Wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot
From a wellexperienced archer hits the mark
His eye doth level at so thou neer return
Unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead
My lord
If I can get him within my pistols length
Ill make him sure enough so farewell to your highness
Thaliard adieu
Exit THALIARD
Till Pericles be dead
My heart can lend no succor to my head
Exit
Enter PERICLES
To Lords without  Let none disturb usWhy should
this change of thoughts
The sad companion dulleyed melancholy
Be my so used a guest as not an hour
In the days glorious walk or peaceful night
The tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet
Here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them
And danger which I feard is at Antioch
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here
Yet neither pleasures art can joy my spirits
Nor yet the others distance comfort me
Then it is thus the passions of the mind
That have their first conception by misdread
Have afternourishment and life by care
And what was first but fear what might be done
Grows elder now and cares it be not done
And so with me the great Antiochus
Gainst whom I am too little to contend
Will think me speaking though I swear to silence
Nor boots it me to say I honour him
If he suspect I may dishonour him
And what may make him blush in being known
Hell stop the course by which it might be known
With hostile forces hell oerspread the land
And with the ostent of war will look so huge
Amazement shall drive courage from the state
Our men be vanquishd ere they do resist
And subjects punishd that neer thought offence
Which care of them not pity of myself
Who am no more but as the tops of trees
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish
And punish that before that he would punish
Enter HELICANUS with other Lords
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast
And keep your mind till you return to us
Peaceful and comfortable
Peace peace and give experience tongue
They do abuse the king that flatter him
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin
The thing which is flatterd but a spark
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing
Whereas reproof obedient and in order
Fits kings as they are men for they may err
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace
He flatters you makes war upon your life
Prince pardon me or strike me if you please
I cannot be much lower than my knees
All leave us else but let your cares oerlook
What shipping and what ladings in our haven
And then return to us
Exeunt Lords
Helicanus thou
Hast moved us what seest thou in our looks
An angry brow dread lord
If there be such a dart in princes frowns
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face
How dare the plants look up to heaven from whence
They have their nourishment
Thou knowst I have power
To take thy life from thee
Kneeling
I have ground the axe myself
Do you but strike the blow
Rise prithee rise
Sit down thou art no flatterer
I thank thee for it and heaven forbid
That kings should let their ears hear their
faults hid
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince
Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant
What wouldst thou have me do
To bear with patience
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself
Thou speakst like a physician Helicanus
That ministerst a potion unto me
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself
Attend me then I went to Antioch
Where as thou knowst against the face of death
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
From whence an issue I might propagate
Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder
The resthark in thine earas black as incest
Which by my knowledge found the sinful father
Seemd not to strike but smooth but thou
knowst this
Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss
Such fear so grew in me I hither fled
Under the covering of a careful night
Who seemd my good protector and being here
Bethought me what was past what might succeed
I knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears
Decrease not but grow faster than the years
And should he doubt it as no doubt he doth
That I should open to the listening air
How many worthy princes bloods were shed
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope
To lop that doubt hell fill this land with arms
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him
When all for mine if I may call offence
Must feel wars blow who spares not innocence
Which love to all of which thyself art one
Who now reprovest me for it
Alas sir
Drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks
Musings into my mind with thousand doubts
How I might stop this tempest ere it came
And finding little comfort to relieve them
I thought it princely charity to grieve them
Well my lord since you have given me leave to speak
Freely will I speak Antiochus you fear
And justly too I think you fear the tyrant
Who either by public war or private treason
Will take away your life
Therefore my lord go travel for a while
Till that his rage and anger be forgot
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life
Your rule direct to any if to me
Day serves not light more faithful than Ill be
I do not doubt thy faith
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence
Well mingle our bloods together in the earth
From whence we had our being and our birth
Tyre I now look from thee then and to Tarsus
Intend my travel where Ill hear from thee
And by whose letters Ill dispose myself
The care I had and have of subjects good
On thee I lay whose wisdoms strength can bear it
Ill take thy word for faith not ask thine oath
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both
But in our orbs well live so round and safe
That time of both this truth shall neer convince
Thou showdst a subjects shine I a true prince
Exeunt
Enter THALIARD
So this is Tyre and this the court Here must I
kill King Pericles and if I do it not I am sure to
be hanged at home tis dangerous Well I perceive
he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that
being bid to ask what he would of the king desired
he might know none of his secrets now do I see he
had some reason fort for if a king bid a man be a
villain hes bound by the indenture of his oath to
be one Hush here come the lords of Tyre
Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES with other Lords of Tyre
You shall not need my fellow peers of Tyre
Further to question me of your kings departure
His seald commission left in trust with me
Doth speak sufficiently hes gone to travel
Aside  How the king gone
If further yet you will be satisfied
Why as it were unlicensed of your loves
He would depart Ill give some light unto you
Being at Antioch
Aside          What from Antioch
Royal Antiochuson what cause I know not
Took some displeasure at him at least he judged so
And doubting lest that he had errd or sinnd
To show his sorrow held correct himself
So puts himself unto the shipmans toil
With whom each minute threatens life or death
Aside  Well I perceive
I shall not be hangd now although I would
But since hes gone the kings seas must please
He scaped the land to perish at the sea
Ill present myself Peace to the lords of Tyre
Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome
From him I come
With message unto princely Pericles
But since my landing I have understood
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels
My message must return from whence it came
We have no reason to desire it
Commended to our master not to us
Yet ere you shall depart this we desire
As friends to Antioch we may feast in Tyre
Exeunt
Enter CLEON the governor of Tarsus with DIONYZA and others
My Dionyza shall we rest us here
And by relating tales of others griefs
See if twill teach us to forget our own
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it
For who digs hills because they do aspire
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher
O my distressed lord even such our griefs are
Here theyre but felt and seen with mischiefs eyes
But like to groves being toppd they higher rise
O Dionyza
Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
Our woes into the air our eyes do weep
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder
That if heaven slumber while their creatures want
They may awake their helps to comfort them
Ill then discourse our woes felt several years
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears
Ill do my best sir
This Tarsus oer which I have the government
A city on whom plenty held full hand
For riches strewd herself even in the streets
Whose towers bore heads so high they kissd the clouds
And strangers neer beheld but wondered at
Whose men and dames so jetted and adornd
Like one anothers glass to trim them by
Their tables were stored full to glad the sight
And not so much to feed on as delight
All poverty was scornd and pride so great
The name of help grew odious to repeat
O tis too true
But see what heaven can do By this our change
These mouths who but of late earth sea and air
Were all too little to content and please
Although they gave their creatures in abundance
As houses are defiled for want of use
They are now starved for want of exercise
Those palates who not yet two summers younger
Must have inventions to delight the taste
Would now be glad of bread and beg for it
Those mothers who to nousle up their babes
Thought nought too curious are ready now
To eat those little darlings whom they loved
So sharp are hungers teeth that man and wife
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life
Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping
Here many sink yet those which see them fall
Have scarce strength left to give them burial
Is not this true
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it
O let those cities that of plentys cup
And her prosperities so largely taste
With their superfluous riots hear these tears
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs
Enter a Lord
Wheres the lord governor
Here
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bringst in haste
For comfort is too far for us to expect
We have descried upon our neighbouring shore
A portly sail of ships make hitherward
I thought as much
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir
That may succeed as his inheritor
And so in ours some neighbouring nation
Taking advantage of our misery
Hath stuffd these hollow vessels with their power
To beat us down the which are down already
And make a conquest of unhappy me
Whereas no glorys got to overcome
Thats the least fear for by the semblance
Of their white flags displayd they bring us peace
And come to us as favourers not as foes
Thou speakst like hims untutord to repeat
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit
But bring they what they will and what they can
What need we fear
The grounds the lowest and we are half way there
Go tell their general we attend him here
To know for what he comes and whence he comes
And what he craves
I go my lord
Exit
Welcome is peace if he on peace consist
If wars we are unable to resist
Enter PERICLES with Attendants
Lord governor for so we hear you are
Let not our ships and number of our men
Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre
And seen the desolation of your streets
Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears
But to relieve them of their heavy load
And these our ships you happily may think
Are like the Trojan horse was stuffd within
With bloody veins expecting overthrow
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead
The gods of Greece protect you
And well pray for you
Arise I pray you rise
We do not look for reverence but to love
And harbourage for ourself our ships and men
The which when any shall not gratify
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought
Be it our wives our children or ourselves
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils
Till whenthe which I hope shall neer be seen
Your grace is welcome to our town and us
Which welcome well accept feast here awhile
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile
Exeunt
Enter GOWER
Here have you seen a mighty king
His child I wis to incest bring
A better prince and benign lord
That will prove awful both in deed and word
Be quiet then as men should be
Till he hath passd necessity
Ill show you those in troubles reign
Losing a mite a mountain gain
The good in conversation
To whom I give my benison
Is still at Tarsus where each man
Thinks all is writ he speken can
And to remember what he does
Build his statue to make him glorious
But tidings to the contrary
Are brought your eyes what need speak I

Good Helicane that stayd at home
Not to eat honey like a drone
From others labours for though he strive
To killen bad keep good alive
And to fulfil his prince desire
Sends word of all that haps in Tyre
How Thaliard came full bent with sin
And had intent to murder him
And that in Tarsus was not best
Longer for him to make his rest
He doing so put forth to seas
Where when men been theres seldom ease
For now the wind begins to blow
Thunder above and deeps below
Make such unquiet that the ship
Should house him safe is wreckd and split
And he good prince having all lost
By waves from coast to coast is tost
All perishen of man of pelf
Ne aught escapen but himself
Till fortune tired with doing bad
Threw him ashore to give him glad
And here he comes What shall be next
Pardon old Gowerthis longs the text
Exit
Enter PERICLES wet
Yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven
Wind rain and thunder remember earthly man
Is but a substance that must yield to you
And I as fits my nature do obey you
Alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks
Washd me from shore to shore and left me breath
Nothing to think on but ensuing death
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes
And having thrown him from your watery grave
Here to have death in peace is all hell crave
Enter three FISHERMEN
What ho Pilch
Ha come and bring away the nets
What Patchbreech I say
What say you master
Look how thou stirrest now come away or Ill
fetch thee with a wanion
Faith master I am thinking of the poor men that
were cast away before us even now
Alas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what
pitiful cries they made to us to help them when
welladay we could scarce help ourselves
Nay master said not I as much when I saw the
porpus how he bounced and tumbled they say
theyre half fish half flesh a plague on them
they neer come but I look to be washed Master I
marvel how the fishes live in the sea
Why as men do aland the great ones eat up the
little ones I can compare our rich misers to
nothing so fitly as to a whale a plays and
tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at
last devours them all at a mouthful such whales
have I heard on o the land who never leave gaping
till theyve swallowed the whole parish church
steeple bells and all
Aside  A pretty moral
But master if I had been the sexton I would have
been that day in the belfry
Why man
Because he should have swallowed me too and when I
had been in his belly I would have kept such a
jangling of the bells that he should never have
left till he cast bells steeple church and
parish up again But if the good King Simonides
were of my mind
Aside  Simonides
We would purge the land of these drones that rob
the bee of her honey
Aside  How from the finny subject of the sea
These fishers tell the infirmities of men
And from their watery empire recollect
All that may men approve or men detect
Peace be at your labour honest fishermen
Honest good fellow whats that If it be a day
fits you search out of the calendar and nobody
look after it
May see the sea hath cast upon your coast
What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
way
A man whom both the waters and the wind
In that vast tenniscourt have made the ball
For them to play upon entreats you pity him
He asks of you that never used to beg
No friend cannot you beg Heres them in our
country Greece gets more with begging than we can do
with working
Canst thou catch any fishes then
Nay then thou wilt starve sure for heres nothing
to be got nowadays unless thou canst fish fort
What I have been I have forgot to know
But what I am want teaches me to think on
A man throngd up with cold my veins are chill
And have no more of life than may suffice
To give my tongue that heat to ask your help
Which if you shall refuse when I am dead
For that I am a man pray see me buried
Die quotha Now gods forbid I have a gown here
come put it on keep thee warm Now afore me a
handsome fellow Come thou shalt go home and
well have flesh for holidays fish for
fastingdays and moreoer puddings and flapjacks
and thou shalt be welcome
I thank you sir
Hark you my friend you said you could not beg
I did but crave
But crave Then Ill turn craver too and so I
shall scape whipping
Why are all your beggars whipped then
O not all my friend not all for if all your
beggars were whipped I would wish no better office
than to be beadle But master Ill go draw up the
net
Exit with Third Fisherman
Aside  How well this honest mirth becomes their labour
Hark you sir do you know where ye are
Not well
Why Ill tell you this is called Pentapolis and
our king the good Simonides
The good King Simonides do you call him
Ay sir and he deserves so to be called for his
peaceable reign and good government
He is a happy king since he gains from his subjects
the name of good by his government How far is his
court distant from this shore
Marry sir half a days journey and Ill tell
you he hath a fair daughter and tomorrow is her
birthday and there are princes and knights come
from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love
Were my fortunes equal to my desires I could wish
to make one there
O sir things must be as they may and what a man
cannot get he may lawfully deal forhis wifes soul
Reenter Second and Third Fishermen drawing up a net
Help master help heres a fish hangs in the net
like a poor mans right in the law twill hardly
come out Ha bots ont tis come at last and
tis turned to a rusty armour
An armour friends I pray you let me see it
Thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses
Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself
And though it was mine own part of my heritage
Which my dead father did bequeath to me
With this strict charge even as he left his life
Keep it my Pericles it hath been a shield
Twixt me and deathand pointed to this brace
For that it saved me keep it in like necessity
The which the gods protect thee frommay
defend thee
It kept where I kept I so dearly loved it
Till the rough seas that spare not any man
Took it in rage though calmd have givent again
I thank thee fort my shipwreck nows no ill
Since I have here my fathers gift ins will
What mean you sir
To beg of you kind friends this coat of worth
For it was sometime target to a king
I know it by this mark He loved me dearly
And for his sake I wish the having of it
And that yould guide me to your sovereigns court
Where with it I may appear a gentleman
And if that ever my low fortunes better
Ill pay your bounties till then rest your debtor
Why wilt thou tourney for the lady
Ill show the virtue I have borne in arms
Why do e take it and the gods give thee good ont
Ay but hark you my friend twas we that made up
this garment through the rough seams of the waters
there are certain condolements certain vails I
hope sir if you thrive youll remember from
whence you had it
Believe t I will
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel
And spite of all the rapture of the sea
This jewel holds his building on my arm
Unto thy value I will mount myself
Upon a courser whose delightful steps
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread
Only my friend I yet am unprovided
Of a pair of bases
Well sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to
make thee a pair and Ill bring thee to the court myself
Then honour be but a goal to my will
This day Ill rise or else add ill to ill

Enter SIMONIDES THAISA Lords and Attendants
Are the knights ready to begin the triumph
They are my liege
And stay your coming to present themselves
Return them we are ready and our daughter
In honour of whose birth these triumphs are
Sits here like beautys child whom nature gat
For men to see and seeing wonder at
Exit a Lord
It pleaseth you my royal father to express
My commendations great whose merits less
Its fit it should be so for princes are
A model which heaven makes like to itself
As jewels lose their glory if neglected
So princes their renowns if not respected
Tis now your honour daughter to explain
The labour of each knight in his device
Which to preserve mine honour Ill perform
Enter a Knight he passes over and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess
Who is the first that doth prefer himself
A knight of Sparta my renowned father
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
The word Lux tua vita mihi
He loves you well that holds his life of you
The Second Knight passes over
Who is the second that presents himself
A prince of Macedon my royal father
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is an armd knight thats conquerd by a lady
The motto thus in Spanish Piu por dulzura que por fuerza
The Third Knight passes over
And whats the third
The third of Antioch
And his device a wreath of chivalry
The word Me pompae provexit apex
The Fourth Knight passes over
What is the fourth
A burning torch thats turned upside down
The word Quod me alit me extinguit
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will
Which can as well inflame as it can kill
The Fifth Knight passes over
The fifth an hand environed with clouds
Holding out gold thats by the touchstone tried
The motto thus Sic spectanda fides
The Sixth Knight PERICLES passes over
And whats
The sixth and last the which the knight himself
With such a graceful courtesy deliverd
He seems to be a stranger but his present is
A witherd branch thats only green at top
The motto In hac spe vivo
A pretty moral
From the dejected state wherein he is
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish
He had need mean better than his outward show
Can any way speak in his just commend
For by his rusty outside he appears
He well may be a stranger for he comes
To an honourd triumph strangely furnished
And on set purpose let his armour rust
Until this day to scour it in the dust
Opinions but a fool that makes us scan
The outward habit by the inward man
But stay the knights are coming we will withdraw
Into the gallery
Exeunt
Great shouts within and all cry The mean knight
Enter SIMONIDES THAISA Lords Attendants and Knights from tilting
Knights
To say youre welcome were superfluous
To place upon the volume of your deeds
As in a titlepage your worth in arms
Were more than you expect or more thans fit
Since every worth in show commends itself
Prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast
You are princes and my guests
But you my knight and guest
To whom this wreath of victory I give
And crown you king of this days happiness
Tis more by fortune lady than by merit
Call it by what you will the day is yours
And here I hope is none that envies it
In framing an artist art hath thus decreed
To make some good but others to exceed
And you are her labourd scholar Come queen o
the feast
For daughter so you arehere take your place
Marshal the rest as they deserve their grace
We are honourd much by good Simonides
Your presence glads our days honour we love
For who hates honour hates the gods above
Sir yonder is your place
Some other is more fit
Contend not sir for we are gentlemen
That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
Envy the great nor do the low despise
You are right courteous knights
Sit sir sit
By Jove I wonder that is king of thoughts
These cates resist me she but thought upon
By Juno that is queen of marriage
All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury
Wishing him my meat Sure hes a gallant gentleman
Hes but a country gentleman
Has done no more than other knights have done
Has broken a staff or so so let it pass
To me he seems like diamond to glass
Yon kings to me like to my fathers picture
Which tells me in that glory once he was
Had princes sit like stars about his throne
And he the sun for them to reverence
None that beheld him but like lesser lights
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy
Where now his sons like a glowworm in the night
The which hath fire in darkness none in light
Whereby I see that Times the king of men
Hes both their parent and he is their grave
And gives them what he will not what they crave
What are you merry knights
Who can be other in this royal presence
Here with a cup thats stored unto the brim
As you do love fill to your mistress lips
We drink this health to you
We thank your grace
Yet pause awhile
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy
As if the entertainment in our court
Had not a show might countervail his worth
Note it not you Thaisa
What is it
To me my father
O attend my daughter
Princes in this should live like gods above
Who freely give to every one that comes
To honour them
And princes not doin g so are like to gnats
Which make a sound but killd are wonderd at
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet
Here say we drink this standingbowl of wine to him
Alas my father it befits not me
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold
He may my proffer take for an offence
Since men take womens gifts for impudence
How
Do as I bid you or youll move me else
Aside  Now by the gods he could not please me better
And furthermore tell him we desire to know of him
Of whence he is his name and parentage
The king my father sir has drunk to you
I thank him
Wishing it so much blood unto your life
I thank both him and you and pledge him freely
And further he desires to know of you
Of whence you are your name and parentage
A gentleman of Tyre my name Pericles
My education been in arts and arms
Who looking for adventures in the world
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore
He thanks your grace names himself Pericles
A gentleman of Tyre
Who only by misfortune of the seas
Bereft of ships and men cast on this shore
Now by the gods I pity his misfortune
And will awake him from his melancholy
Come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles
And waste the time which looks for other revels
Even in your armours as you are addressd
Will very well become a soldiers dance
I will not have excuse with saying this
Loud music is too harsh for ladies heads
Since they love men in arms as well as beds
The Knights dance
So this was well askdtwas so well performd
Come sir
Here is a lady that wants breathing too
And I have heard you knights of Tyre
Are excellent in making ladies trip
And that their measures are as excellent
O thats as much as you would be denied
Of your fair courtesy
The Knights and Ladies dance
Unclasp unclasp
Thanks gentlemen to all all have done well
To PERICLES
But you the best Pages and lights to conduct
These knights unto their several lodgings
To PERICLES
Yours sir
We have given order to be next our own
I am at your graces pleasure
Princes it is too late to talk of love
And thats the mark I know you level at
Therefore each one betake him to his rest
Tomorrow all for speeding do their best
Exeunt
Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES
No Escanes know this of me
Antiochus from incest lived not free
For which the most high gods not minding longer
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store
Due to this heinous capital offence
Even in the height and pride of all his glory
When he was seated in a chariot
Of an inestimable value and his daughter with him
A fire from heaven came and shrivelld up
Their bodies even to loathing for they so stunk
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
Scorn now their hand should give them burial
Twas very strange
And yet but justice for though
This king were great his greatness was no guard
To bar heavens shaft but sin had his reward
Tis very true
Enter two or three Lords
See not a man in private conference
Or council has respect with him but he
It shall no longer grieve without reproof
And cursed be he that will not second it
Follow me then Lord Helicane a word
With me and welcome happy day my lords
Know that our griefs are risen to the top
And now at length they overflow their banks
Your griefs for what wrong not your prince you love
Wrong not yourself then noble Helicane
But if the prince do live let us salute him
Or know what grounds made happy by his breath
If in the world he live well seek him out
If in his grave he rest well find him there
And be resolved he lives to govern us
Or dead gives cause to mourn his funeral
And leave us to our free election
Whose death indeeds the strongest in our censure
And knowing this kingdom is without a head
Like goodly buildings left without a roof
Soon fall to ruinyour noble self
That best know how to rule and how to reign
We thus submit untoour sovereign
Live noble Helicane
For honours cause forbear your suffrages
If that you love Prince Pericles forbear
Take I your wish I leap into the seas
Wheres hourly trouble for a minutes ease
A twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to
Forbear the absence of your king
If in which time expired he not return
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke
But if I cannot win you to this love
Go search like nobles like noble subjects
And in your search spend your adventurous worth
Whom if you find and win unto return
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown
To wisdom hes a fool that will not yield
And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us
We with our travels will endeavour us
Then you love us we you and well clasp hands
When peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands
Exeunt
Enter SIMONIDES reading a letter at one door the Knights meet him
Good morrow to the good Simonides
Knights from my daughter this I let you know
That for this twelvemonth shell not undertake
A married life
Her reason to herself is only known
Which yet from her by no means can I get
May we not get access to her my lord
Faith by no means she has so strictly tied
Her to her chamber that tis impossible
One twelve moons more shell wear Dianas livery
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowd
And on her virgin honour will not break it
Loath to bid farewell we take our leaves
Exeunt Knights
So
They are well dispatchd now to my daughters letter
She tells me here shed wed the stranger knight
Or never more to view nor day nor light
Tis well mistress your choice agrees with mine
I like that well nay how absolute shes int
Not minding whether I dislike or no
Well I do commend her choice
And will no longer have it be delayd
Soft here he comes I must dissemble it
Enter PERICLES
All fortune to the good Simonides
To you as much sir I am beholding to you
For your sweet music this last night I do
Protest my ears were never better fed
With such delightful pleasing harmony
It is your graces pleasure to commend
Not my desert
Sir you are musics master
The worst of all her scholars my good lord
Let me ask you one thing
What do you think of my daughter sir
A most virtuous princess
And she is fair too is she not
As a fair day in summer wondrous fair
Sir my daughter thinks very well of you
Ay so well that you must be her master
And she will be your scholar therefore look to it
I am unworthy for her schoolmaster
She thinks not so peruse this writing else
Aside  Whats here
A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre
Tis the kings subtlety to have my life
O seek not to entrap me gracious lord
A stranger and distressed gentleman
That never aimd so high to love your daughter
But bent all offices to honour her
Thou hast bewitchd my daughter and thou art
A villain
By the gods I have not
Never did thought of mine levy offence
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure
Traitor thou liest
Traitor
Ay traitor
Even in his throatunless it be the king
That calls me traitor I return the lie
Aside  Now by the gods I do applaud his courage
That never relishd of a base descent
I came unto your court for honours cause
And not to be a rebel to her state
And he that otherwise accounts of me
This sword shall prove hes honours enemy
No
Here comes my daughter she can witness it
Enter THAISA
Then as you are as virtuous as fair
Resolve your angry father if my tongue
Did ere solicit or my hand subscribe
To any syllable that made love to you
Why sir say if you had
Who takes offence at that would make me glad
Yea mistress are you so peremptory
Aside
I am glad ont with all my heart
Ill tame you Ill bring you in subjection
Will you not having my consent
Bestow your love and your affections
Upon a stranger
Aside
who for aught I know
May be nor can I think the contrary
As great in blood as I myself
Therefore hear you mistress either frame
Your will to mineand you sir hear you
Either be ruled by me or I will make you
Man and wife
Nay come your hands and lips must seal it too
And being joind Ill thus your hopes destroy
And for a further griefGod give you joy
What are you both pleased
Yes if you love me sir
Even as my life or blood that fosters it
What are you both agreed
Yes if it please your majesty
It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed
And then with what haste you can get you to bed
Exeunt
Enter GOWER
Now sleep yslaked hath the rout
No din but snores the house about
Made louder by the oerfed breast
Of this most pompous marriagefeast
The cat with eyne of burning coal
Now crouches fore the mouses hole
And crickets sing at the ovens mouth
Eer the blither for their drouth
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed
Where by the loss of maidenhead
A babe is moulded Be attent
And time that is so briefly spent
With your fine fancies quaintly eche
Whats dumb in show Ill plain with speech
DUMB SHOW
Enter PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door with  Attendants a Messenger meets them kneels and  gives PERICLES a letter PERICLES shows it  SIMONIDES the Lords kneel to him Then enter  THAISA with child with LYCHORIDA a nurse The  KING shows her the letter she rejoices she and  PERICLES takes leave of her father and depart with  LYCHORIDA and their Attendants Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest
By many a dern and painful perch
Of Pericles the careful search
By the four opposing coigns
Which the world together joins
Is made with all due diligence
That horse and sail and high expense
Can stead the quest At last from Tyre
Fame answering the most strange inquire
To the court of King Simonides
Are letters brought the tenor these
Antiochus and his daughter dead
The men of Tyrus on the head
Of Helicanus would set on
The crown of Tyre but he will none
The mutiny he there hastes t oppress
Says to em if King Pericles
Come not home in twice six moons
He obedient to their dooms
Will take the crown The sum of this
Brought hither to Pentapolis
Yravished the regions round
And every one with claps can sound
Our heirapparent is a king
Who dreamd who thought of such a thing
Brief he must hence depart to Tyre
His queen with child makes her desire
Which who shall crossalong to go
Omit we all their dole and woe
Lychorida her nurse she takes
And so to sea Their vessel shakes
On Neptunes billow half the flood
Hath their keel cut but fortunes mood
Varies again the grisly north
Disgorges such a tempest forth
That as a duck for life that dives
So up and down the poor ship drives
The lady shrieks and wellanear
Does fall in travail with her fear
And what ensues in this fell storm
Shall for itself itself perform
Conveniently the rest convey
Which might not what by me is told
In your imagination hold
This stage the ship upon whose deck
The seatost Pericles appears to speak
Exit
Enter PERICLES on shipboard
Thou god of this great vast rebuke these surges
Which wash both heaven and hell and thou that hast
Upon the winds command bind them in brass
Having calld them from the deep O still
Thy deafening dreadful thunders gently quench
Thy nimble sulphurous flashes O how Lychorida
How does my queen Thou stormest venomously
Wilt thou spit all thyself The seamans whistle
Is as a whisper in the ears of death
Unheard LychoridaLucina O
Divinest patroness and midwife gentle
To those that cry by night convey thy deity
Aboard our dancing boat make swift the pangs
Of my queens travails
Enter LYCHORIDA with an Infant
Now Lychorida
Here is a thing too young for such a place
Who if it had conceit would die as I
Am like to do take in your arms this piece
Of your dead queen
How how Lychorida
Patience good sir do not assist the storm
Heres all that is left living of your queen
A little daughter for the sake of it
Be manly and take comfort
O you gods
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts
And snatch them straight away We here below
Recall not what we give and therein may
Use honour with you
Patience good sir
Even for this charge
Now mild may be thy life
For a more blustrous birth had never babe
Quiet and gentle thy conditions for
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
That ever was princes child Happy what follows
Thou hast as chiding a nativity
As fire air water earth and heaven can make
To herald thee from the womb even at the first
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit
With all thou canst find here Now the good gods
Throw their best eyes upont
Enter two Sailors
What courage sir God save you
Courage enough I do not fear the flaw
It hath done to me the worst Yet for the love
Of this poor infant this freshnew seafarer
I would it would be quiet
Slack the bolins there Thou wilt not wilt thou
Blow and split thyself
But searoom an the brine and cloudy billow kiss
the moon I care not
Sir your queen must overboard the sea works high
the wind is loud and will not lie till the ship be
cleared of the dead
Thats your superstition
Pardon us sir with us at sea it hath been still
observed and we are strong in custom Therefore
briefly yield her for she must overboard straight
As you think meet Most wretched queen
Here she lies sir
A terrible childbed hast thou had my dear
No light no fire the unfriendly elements
Forgot thee utterly nor have I time
To give thee hallowd to thy grave but straight
Must cast thee scarcely coffind in the ooze
Where for a monument upon thy bones
And eerremaining lamps the belching whale
And humming water must oerwhelm thy corpse
Lying with simple shells O Lychorida
Bid Nestor bring me spices ink and paper
My casket and my jewels and bid Nicander
Bring me the satin coffer lay the babe
Upon the pillow hie thee whiles I say
A priestly farewell to her suddenly woman
Exit LYCHORIDA
Sir we have a chest beneath the hatches caulked
and bitumed ready
I thank thee Mariner say what coast is this
We are near Tarsus
Thither gentle mariner
Alter thy course for Tyre When canst thou reach it
By break of day if the wind cease
O make for Tarsus
There will I visit Cleon for the babe
Cannot hold out to Tyrus there Ill leave it
At careful nursing Go thy ways good mariner
Ill bring the body presently
Exeunt

I have been in many but such a night as this
Till now I neer endured
Your master will be dead ere you return
Theres nothing can be ministerd to nature
That can recover him
To PHILEMON
Give this to the pothecary
And tell me how it works
Exeunt all but CERIMON
Enter two Gentlemen
Good morrow
Good morrow to your lordship
Gentlemen
Why do you stir so early
Sir
Our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea
Shook as the earth did quake
The very principals did seem to rend
And allto topple pure surprise and fear
Made me to quit the house
That is the cause we trouble you so early
Tis not our husbandry
O you say well
But I much marvel that your lordship having
Rich tire about you should at these early hours
Shake off the golden slumber of repose
Tis most strange
Nature should be so conversant with pain
Being thereto not compelld
I hold it ever
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
Than nobleness and riches careless heirs
May the two latter darken and expend
But immortality attends the former
Making a man a god Tis known I ever
Have studied physic through which secret art
By turning oer authorities I have
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
That dwell in vegetives in metals stones
And I can speak of the disturbances
That nature works and of her cures which doth give me
A more content in course of true delight
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags
To please the fool and death
Your honour has through Ephesus pourd forth
Your charity and hundreds call themselves
Your creatures who by you have been restored
And not your knowledge your personal pain but even
Your purse still open hath built Lord Cerimon
Such strong renown as time shall neer decay
Enter two or three Servants with a chest
So lift there
What is that
Sir even now
Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest
Tis of some wreck
Set t down lets look upont
Tis like a coffin sir
Whateer it be
Tis wondrous heavy Wrench it open straight
If the seas stomach be oercharged with gold
Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us
Tis so my lord
How close tis caulkd and bitumed
Did the sea cast it up
I never saw so huge a billow sir
As tossd it upon shore
Wrench it open
Soft it smells most sweetly in my sense
A delicate odour
As ever hit my nostril So up with it
O you most potent gods whats here a corse
Most strange
Shrouded in cloth of state balmd and entreasured
With full bags of spices A passport too
Reads from a scroll
Here I give to understand
If eer this coffin drive aland
I King Pericles have lost
This queen worth all our mundane cost
Who finds her give her burying
She was the daughter of a king
Besides this treasure for a fee
The gods requite his charity
If thou livest Pericles thou hast a heart
That even cracks for woe This chanced tonight
Most likely sir
Nay certainly tonight
For look how fresh she looks They were too rough
That threw her in the sea Make a fire within
Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet
Exit a Servant
Death may usurp on nature many hours
And yet the fire of life kindle again
The oerpressd spirits I heard of an Egyptian
That had nine hours lien dead
Who was by good appliance recovered
Reenter a Servant with boxes napkins and fire
Well said well said the fire and cloths
The rough and woeful music that we have
Cause it to sound beseech you
The viol once more how thou stirrst thou block
The music thereI pray you give her air
Gentlemen
This queen will live nature awakes a warmth
Breathes out of her she hath not been entranced
Above five hours see how she gins to blow
Into lifes flower again
The heavens
Through you increase our wonder and set up
Your fame forever
She is alive behold
Her eyelids cases to those heavenly jewels
Which Pericles hath lost
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold
The diamonds of a most praised water
Do appear to make the world twice rich Live
And make us weep to hear your fate fair creature
Rare as you seem to be
She moves
O dear Diana
Where am I Wheres my lord What world is this
Is not this strange
Most rare
Hush my gentle neighbours
Lend me your hands to the next chamber bear her
Get linen now this matter must be lookd to
For her relapse is mortal Come come
And AEsculapius guide us
Exeunt carrying her away
Enter PERICLES CLEON DIONYZA and LYCHORIDA with MARINA in her arms
Most honourd Cleon I must needs be gone
My twelve months are expired and Tyrus stands
In a litigious peace You and your lady
Take from my heart all thankfulness The gods
Make up the rest upon you
Your shafts of fortune though they hurt you mortally
Yet glance full wanderingly on us
O your sweet queen
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither
To have blessd mine eyes with her
We cannot but obey
The powers above us Could I rage and roar
As doth the sea she lies in yet the end
Must be as tis My gentle babe Marina whom
For she was born at sea I have named so here
I charge your charity withal leaving her
The infant of your care beseeching you
To give her princely training that she may be
Mannerd as she is born
Fear not my lord but think
Your grace that fed my country with your corn
For which the peoples prayers still fall upon you
Must in your child be thought on If neglection
Should therein make me vile the common body
By you relieved would force me to my duty
But if to that my nature need a spur
The gods revenge it upon me and mine
To the end of generation
I believe you
Your honour and your goodness teach me tot
Without your vows Till she be married madam
By bright Diana whom we honour all
Unscissord shall this hair of mine remain
Though I show ill int So I take my leave
Good madam make me blessed in your care
In bringing up my child
I have one myself
Who shall not be more dear to my respect
Than yours my lord
Madam my thanks and prayers
Well bring your grace een to the edge o the shore
Then give you up to the maskd Neptune and
The gentlest winds of heaven
I will embrace
Your offer Come dearest madam O no tears
Lychorida no tears
Look to your little mistress on whose grace
You may depend hereafter Come my lord
Exeunt
Enter CERIMON and THAISA
Madam this letter and some certain jewels
Lay with you in your coffer which are now
It is my lords
That I was shippd at sea I well remember
Even on my eaning time but whether there
Deliverd by the holy gods
I cannot rightly say But since King Pericles
My wedded lord I neer shall see again
A vestal livery will I take me to
And never more have joy
Madam if this you purpose as ye speak
Dianas temple is not distant far
Where you may abide till your date expire
Moreover if you please a niece of mine
Shall there attend you
My recompense is thanks thats all
Yet my good will is great though the gift small
Exeunt
Enter GOWER
Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre
Welcomed and settled to his own desire
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus
Unto Diana there a votaress
Now to Marina bend your mind
At Tarsus and by Cleon traind
In music letters who hath gaind
Of education all the grace
Which makes her both the heart and place
Of general wonder But alack
That monster envy oft the wrack
Of earned praise Marinas life
Seeks to take off by treasons knife
And in this kind hath our Cleon
One daughter and a wench full grown
Even ripe for marriagerite this maid
Hight Philoten and it is said
For certain in our story she
Would ever with Marina be
Bet when she weaved the sleided silk
With fingers long small white as milk
Or when she would with sharp needle wound
The cambric which she made more sound
By hurting it or when to the lute
She sung and made the nightbird mute
That still records with moan or when
She would with rich and constant pen
Vail to her mistress Dian still
This Philoten contends in skill
With absolute Marina so
With the dove of Paphos might the crow
Vie feathers white Marina gets
All praises which are paid as debts
And not as given This so darks
In Philoten all graceful marks
That Cleons wife with envy rare
A present murderer does prepare
For good Marina that her daughter
Might stand peerless by this slaughter
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead
Lychorida our nurse is dead
And cursed Dionyza hath
The pregnant instrument of wrath
Prest for this blow The unborn event
I do commend to your content
Only I carry winged time
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme
Which never could I so convey
Unless your thoughts went on my way
Dionyza does appear
With Leonine a murderer
Exit
Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE
Thy oath remember thou hast sworn to dot
Tis but a blow which never shall be known
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon
To yield thee so much profit Let not conscience
Which is but cold inflaming love i thy bosom
Inflame too nicely nor let pity which
Even women have cast off melt thee but be
A soldier to thy purpose
I will dot but yet she is a goodly creature
The fitter then the gods should have her Here
she comes weeping for her only mistress death
Thou art resolved
I am resolved
Enter MARINA with a basket of flowers
No I will rob Tellus of her weed
To strew thy green with flowers the yellows blues
The purple violets and marigolds
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave
While summerdays do last Ay me poor maid
Born in a tempest when my mother died
This world to me is like a lasting storm
Whirring me from my friends
How now Marina why do you keep alone
How chance my daughter is not with you Do not
Consume your blood with sorrowing you have
A nurse of me Lord how your favours changed
With this unprofitable woe
Come give me your flowers ere the sea mar it
Walk with Leonine the air is quick there
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach Come
Leonine take her by the arm walk with her
No I pray you
Ill not bereave you of your servant
Come come
I love the king your father and yourself
With more than foreign heart We every day
Expect him here when he shall come and find
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage
Blame both my lord and me that we have taken
No care to your best courses Go I pray you
Walk and be cheerful once again reserve
That excellent complexion which did steal
The eyes of young and old Care not for me
I can go home alone
Well I will go
But yet I have no desire to it
Come come I know tis good for you
Walk half an hour Leonine at the least
Remember what I have said
I warrant you madam
Ill leave you my sweet lady for a while
Pray walk softly do not heat your blood
What I must have a care of you
My thanks sweet madam
Exit DIONYZA
Is this wind westerly that blows
Southwest
When I was born the wind was north
Wast so
My father as nurse said did never fear
But cried Good seaman to the sailors galling
His kingly hands haling ropes
And clasping to the mast endured a sea
That almost burst the deck
When was this
When I was born
Never was waves nor wind more violent
And from the laddertackle washes off
A canvasclimber Ha says one wilt out
And with a dropping industry they skip
From stem to stern the boatswain whistles and
The master calls and trebles their confusion
Come say your prayers
What mean you
If you require a little space for prayer
I grant it pray but be not tedious
For the gods are quick of ear and I am sworn
To do my work with haste
Why will you kill me
To satisfy my lady
Why would she have me killd
Now as I can remember by my troth
I never did her hurt in all my life
I never spake bad word nor did ill turn
To any living creature believe me la
I never killd a mouse nor hurt a fly
I trod upon a worm against my will
But I wept for it How have I offended
Wherein my death might yield her any profit
Or my life imply her any danger
My commission
Is not to reason of the deed but do it
You will not dot for all the world I hope
You are well favourd and your looks foreshow
You have a gentle heart I saw you lately
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought
Good sooth it showd well in you do so now
Your lady seeks my life come you between
And save poor me the weaker
I am sworn
And will dispatch
He seizes her
Enter Pirates
Hold villain
LEONINE runs away
A prize a prize
Halfpart mates halfpart
Come lets have her aboard suddenly
Exeunt Pirates with MARINA
Reenter LEONINE
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes
And they have seized Marina Let her go
Theres no hope she will return Ill swear
shes dead
And thrown into the sea But Ill see further
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her
Not carry her aboard If she remain
Whom they have ravishd must by me be slain
Exit
Enter Pandar Bawd and BOULT
Boult
Sir
Search the market narrowly Mytilene is full of
gallants We lost too much money this mart by being
too wenchless
We were never so much out of creatures We have but
poor three and they can do no more than they can
Therefore lets have fresh ones whateer we pay for
them If there be not a conscience to be used in
every trade we shall never prosper
Thou sayest true tis not our bringing up of poor
bastardsas I think I have brought up some eleven
Ay to eleven and brought them down again But
shall I search the market
What else man The stuff we have a strong wind
will blow it to pieces they are so pitifully sodden
Thou sayest true theyre too unwholesome o
conscience The poor Transylvanian is dead that
lay with the little baggage
Ay she quickly pooped him she made him roastmeat
for worms But Ill go search the market
Exit
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
proportion to live quietly and so give over
Why to give over I pray you is it a shame to get
when we are old
O our credit comes not in like the commodity nor
the commodity wages not with the danger therefore
if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
estate twere not amiss to keep our door hatched
Besides the sore terms we stand upon with the gods
will be strong with us for giving over
Come other sorts offend as well as we
As well as we ay and better too we offend worse
Neither is our profession any trade its no
calling But here comes Boult
Reenter BOULT with the Pirates and MARINA
To MARINA  Come your ways My masters you say
shes a virgin
O sir we doubt it not
Master I have gone through for this piece you see
if you like her so if not I have lost my earnest
Boult has she any qualities
She has a good face speaks well and has excellent
good clothes theres no further necessity of
qualities can make her be refused
Whats her price Boult
I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces
Well follow me my masters you shall have your
money presently Wife take her in instruct her
what she has to do that she may not be raw in her
entertainment
Exeunt Pandar and Pirates
Boult take you the marks of her the colour of her
hair complexion height age with warrant of her
virginity and cry He that will give most shall
have her first Such a maidenhead were no cheap
thing if men were as they have been Get this done
as I command you
Performance shall follow
Exit
Alack that Leonine was so slack so slow
He should have struck not spoke or that these pirates
Not enough barbarous had not oerboard thrown me
For to seek my mother
Why lament you pretty one
That I am pretty
Come the gods have done their part in you
I accuse them not
You are light into my hands where you are like to live
The more my fault
To scape his hands where I was like to die
Ay and you shall live in pleasure
No
Yes indeed shall you and taste gentlemen of all
fashions you shall fare well you shall have the
difference of all complexions What do you stop your ears
Are you a woman
What would you have me be an I be not a woman
An honest woman or not a woman
Marry whip thee gosling I think I shall have
something to do with you Come youre a young
foolish sapling and must be bowed as I would have
you
The gods defend me
If it please the gods to defend you by men then men
must comfort you men must feed you men must stir
you up Boults returned
Reenter BOULT
Now sir hast thou cried her through the market
I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs
I have drawn her picture with my voice
And I prithee tell me how dost thou find the
inclination of the people especially of the younger sort
Faith they listened to me as they would have
hearkened to their fathers testament There was a
Spaniards mouth so watered that he went to bed to
her very description
We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on
Tonight tonight But mistress do you know the
French knight that cowers i the hams
Who Monsieur Veroles
Ay he he offered to cut a caper at the
proclamation but he made a groan at it and swore
he would see her tomorrow
Well well as for him he brought his disease
hither here he does but repair it I know he will
come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the
sun
Well if we had of every nation a traveller we
should lodge them with this sign
To MARINA  Pray you come hither awhile You
have fortunes coming upon you Mark me you must
seem to do that fearfully which you commit
willingly despise profit where you have most gain
To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good
opinion and that opinion a mere profit
I understand you not
O take her home mistress take her home these
Thou sayest true i faith so they must for your
bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
with warrant
Faith some do and some do not But mistress if
I have bargained for the joint
Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit
I may so
Who should deny it Come young one I like the
manner of your garments well
Ay by my faith they shall not be changed yet
Boult spend thou that in the town report what a
sojourner we have youll lose nothing by custom
When nature flamed this piece she meant thee a good
turn therefore say what a paragon she is and thou
hast the harvest out of thine own report
I warrant you mistress thunder shall not so awake
the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
the lewdlyinclined Ill bring home some tonight
Come your ways follow me
If fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep
Untied I still my virgin knot will keep
Diana aid my purpose
What have we to do with Diana Pray you will you go with us
Exeunt
Enter CLEON and DIONYZA
Why are you foolish Can it be undone
O Dionyza such a piece of slaughter
The sun and moon neer lookd upon
I think
Youll turn a child again
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world
Ild give it to undo the deed O lady
Much less in blood than virtue yet a princess
To equal any single crown o the earth
I the justice of compare O villain Leonine
Whom thou hast poisond too
If thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness
When noble Pericles shall demand his child
That she is dead Nurses are not the fates
To foster it nor ever to preserve
She died at night Ill say so Who can cross it
Unless you play the pious innocent
And for an honest attribute cry out
She died by foul play
O go to Well well
Of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods
Do like this worst
Be one of those that think
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence
And open this to Pericles I do shame
To think of what a noble strain you are
And of how coward a spirit
To such proceeding
Who ever but his approbation added
Though not his prime consent he did not flow
From honourable sources
Be it so then
Yet none does know but you how she came dead
Nor none can know Leonine being gone
She did disdain my child and stood between
Her and her fortunes none would look on her
But cast their gazes on Marinas face
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
Not worth the time of day It pierced me through
And though you call my course unnatural
You not your child well loving yet I find
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
Performd to your sole daughter
Heavens forgive it
And as for Pericles
What should he say We wept after her hearse
And yet we mourn her monument
Is almost finishd and her epitaphs
A general praise to her and care in us
At whose expense tis done
Thou art like the harpy
Which to betray dost with thine angels face
Seize with thine eagles talons
You are like one that superstitiously
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies
But yet I know youll do as I advise
Exeunt
Enter GOWER before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus
Thus time we waste and longest leagues make short
Sail seas in cockles have an wish but fort
Making to take your imagination
From bourn to bourn region to region
By you being pardond we commit no crime
To use one language in each several clime
To learn of me who stand i the gaps to teach you
The stages of our story Pericles
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas
Attended on by many a lord and knight
To see his daughter all his lifes delight
Old Escanes whom Helicanus late
Advanced in time to great and high estate
Is left to govern Bear you it in mind
Old Helicanus goes along behind
Wellsailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
This king to Tarsusthink his pilot thought
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on
To fetch his daughter home who first is gone
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile
Your ears unto your eyes Ill reconcile
DUMB SHOW
Enter PERICLES at one door with all his train  CLEON and DIONYZA at the other CLEON shows  PERICLES the tomb whereat PERICLES makes  lamentation puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA
See how belief may suffer by foul show
This borrowd passion stands for true old woe
And Pericles in sorrow all devourd
With sighs shot through and biggest tears
oershowerd
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks He swears
Never to wash his face nor cut his hairs
He puts on sackcloth and to sea He bears
A tempest which his mortal vessel tears
And yet he rides it out Now please you wit
The epitaph is for Marina writ
By wicked Dionyza
Reads the inscription on MARINAs monument
The fairest sweetst and best lies here
Who witherd in her spring of year
She was of Tyrus the kings daughter
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter
Marina was she calld and at her birth
Thetis being proud swallowd some part o the earth
Therefore the earth fearing to be oerflowd
Hath Thetis birthchild on the heavens bestowd
Wherefore she does and swears shell never stint
Make raging battery upon shores of flint
No visor does become black villany
So well as soft and tender flattery
Let Pericles believe his daughters dead
And bear his courses to be ordered
His daughters woe and heavy welladay
In her unholy service Patience then
And think you now are all in Mytilene
Exit
Enter from the brothel two Gentlemen
Did you ever hear the like
No nor never shall do in such a place as this she
being once gone
But to have divinity preached there did you ever
dream of such a thing
No no Come I am for no more bawdyhouses
shalls go hear the vestals sing
Ill do any thing now that is virtuous but I
am out of the road of rutting for ever
Exeunt
Enter Pandar Bawd and BOULT
Well I had rather than twice the worth of her she
had neer come here
Fie fie upon her shes able to freeze the god
Priapus and undo a whole generation We must
either get her ravished or be rid of her When she
should do for clients her fitment and do me the
kindness of our profession she has me her quirks
her reasons her master reasons her prayers her
knees that she would make a puritan of the devil
if he should cheapen a kiss of her
Faith I must ravish her or shell disfurnish us
of all our cavaliers and make our swearers priests
Now the pox upon her greensickness for me
Faith theres no way to be rid ont but by the
way to the pox Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised
We should have both lord and lown if the peevish
baggage would but give way to customers
Enter LYSIMACHUS
How now How a dozen of virginities
Now the gods tobless your honour
I am glad to see your honour in good health
You may so tis the better for you that your
resorters stand upon sound legs How now
wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
withal and defy the surgeon
We have here one sir if she wouldbut there never
came her like in Mytilene
If sheld do the deed of darkness thou wouldst say
Your honour knows what tis to say well enough
Well call forth call forth
For flesh and blood sir white and red you shall
see a rose and she were a rose indeed if she had but
What prithee
O sir I can be modest
That dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it
gives a good report to a number to be chaste
Exit BOULT
Here comes that which grows to the stalk never
plucked yet I can assure you
Reenter BOULT with MARINA
Is she not a fair creature
Faith she would serve after a long voyage at sea
Well theres for you leave us
I beseech your honour give me leave a word and
Ill have done presently
I beseech you do
To MARINA  First I would have you note this is
an honourable man
I desire to find him so that I may worthily note him
Next hes the governor of this country and a man
whom I am bound to
If he govern the country you are bound to him
indeed but how honourable he is in that I know not
Pray you without any more virginal fencing will
you use him kindly He will line your apron with gold
What he will do graciously I will thankfully receive
Ha you done
My lord shes not paced yet you must take some
pains to work her to your manage Come we will
leave his honour and her together Go thy ways
Exeunt Bawd Pandar and BOULT
Now pretty one how long have you been at this trade
What trade sir
Why I cannot namet but I shall offend
I cannot be offended with my trade Please you to name it
How long have you been of this profession
Eer since I can remember
Did you go to t so young Were you a gamester at
five or at seven
Earlier too sir if now I be one
Why the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a
creature of sale
Do you know this house to be a place of such resort
and will come into t I hear say you are of
honourable parts and are the governor of this place
Why hath your principal made known unto you who I am
Who is my principal
Why your herbwoman she that sets seeds and roots
of shame and iniquity O you have heard something
of my power and so stand aloof for more serious
wooing But I protest to thee pretty one my
authority shall not see thee or else look friendly
upon thee Come bring me to some private place
come come
If you were born to honour show it now
If put upon you make the judgment good
That thought you worthy of it
Hows this hows this Some more be sage
For me
That am a maid though most ungentle fortune
Have placed me in this sty where since I came
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic
O that the gods
Would set me free from this unhallowd place
Though they did change me to the meanest bird
That flies i the purer air
I did not think
Thou couldst have spoke so well neer dreamd thou couldst
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind
Thy speech had alterd it Hold heres gold for thee
Persever in that clear way thou goest
And the gods strengthen thee
The good gods preserve you
For me be you thoughten
That I came with no ill intent for to me
The very doors and windows savour vilely
Fare thee well Thou art a piece of virtue and
I doubt not but thy training hath been noble
Hold heres more gold for thee
A curse upon him die he like a thief
That robs thee of thy goodness If thou dost
Hear from me it shall be for thy good
Reenter BOULT
I beseech your honour one piece for me
Avaunt thou damned doorkeeper
Your house but for this virgin that doth prop it
Would sink and overwhelm you Away
Exit
Hows this We must take another course with you
If your peevish chastity which is not worth a
breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope
shall undo a whole household let me be gelded like
a spaniel Come your ways
Whither would you have me
I must have your maidenhead taken off or the common
hangman shall execute it Come your ways Well
have no more gentlemen driven away Come your ways I say
Reenter Bawd
How now whats the matter
Worse and worse mistress she has here spoken holy
words to the Lord Lysimachus
O abominable
She makes our profession as it were to stink afore
the face of the gods
Marry hang her up for ever
The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
nobleman and she sent him away as cold as a
snowball saying his prayers too
Boult take her away use her at thy pleasure
crack the glass of her virginity and make the rest malleable
An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
is she shall be ploughed
Hark hark you gods
She conjures away with her Would she had never
come within my doors Marry hang you Shes born
to undo us Will you not go the way of womenkind
Marry come up my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays
Exit
Come mistress come your ways with me
Whither wilt thou have me
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear
Prithee tell me one thing first
Come now your one thing
What canst thou wish thine enemy to be
Why I could wish him to be my master or rather my mistress
Neither of these are so bad as thou art
Since they do better thee in their command
Thou holdst a place for which the painedst fiend
Of hell would not in reputation change
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib
To the choleric fisting of every rogue
Thy ear is liable thy food is such
As hath been belchd on by infected lungs
What would you have me do go to the wars would
you where a man may serve seven years for the loss
of a leg and have not money enough in the end to
buy him a wooden one
Do any thing but this thou doest Empty
OLD receptacles or common shores of filth
Serve by indenture to the common hangman
Any of these ways are yet better than this
For what thou professest a baboon could he speak
Would own a name too dear O that the gods
Would safely deliver me from this place
Here heres gold for thee
If that thy master would gain by thee
Proclaim that I can sing weave sew and dance
With other virtues which Ill keep from boast
And I will undertake all these to teach
I doubt not but this populous city will
Yield many scholars
But can you teach all this you speak of
Prove that I cannot take me home again
And prostitute me to the basest groom
That doth frequent your house
Well I will see what I can do for thee if I can
place thee I will
But amongst honest women
Faith my acquaintance lies little amongst them
But since my master and mistress have bought you
theres no going but by their consent therefore I
will make them acquainted with your purpose and I
Come Ill do for thee what I can come your ways
Exeunt
Enter GOWER
Marina thus the brothel scapes and chances
Into an honest house our story says
She sings like one immortal and she dances
As goddesslike to her admired lays
Deep clerks she dumbs and with her needle composes
Natures own shape of bud bird branch or berry
That even her art sisters the natural roses
Her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry
That pupils lacks she none of noble race
Who pour their bounty on her and her gain
She gives the cursed bawd Here we her place
And to her father turn our thoughts again
Where we left him on the sea We there him lost
Whence driven before the winds he is arrived
Here where his daughter dwells and on this coast
Suppose him now at anchor The city strived
God Neptunes annual feast to keep from whence
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies
His banners sable trimmd with rich expense
And to him in his barge with fervor hies
In your supposing once more put your sight
Of heavy Pericles think this his bark
Shall be discoverd please you sit and hark
Exit
pavilion on deck with a curtain before it PERICLES
within it reclined on a couch A barge lying
beside the Tyrian vessel
Enter two Sailors one belonging to the Tyrian vessel the other to the barge to them HELICANUS
To the Sailor of Mytilene  Where is lord Helicanus

O here he is

That he have his Call up some gentlemen
Ho gentlemen my lord calls

The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend and go on board the barge
Enter from thence LYSIMACHUS and Lords with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors
Sir
This is the man that can in aught you would
Resolve you
Hail reverend sir the gods preserve you
And you sir to outlive the age I am
And die as I would do
You wish me well
Being on shore honouring of Neptunes triumphs
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us
I made to it to know of whence you are
First what is your place
I am the governor of this place you lie before
Sir
Our vessel is of Tyre in it the king
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
To any one nor taken sustenance
But to prorogue his grief
Upon what ground is his distemperature
Twould be too tedious to repeat
But the main grief springs from the loss
Of a beloved daughter and a wife
May we not see him
You may
But bootless is your sight he will not speak To any
Yet let me obtain my wish
Behold him
PERICLES discovered
This was a goodly person
Till the disaster that one mortal night
Drove him to this
Sir king all hail the gods preserve you
Hail royal sir
It is in vain he will not speak to you
Sir
We have a maid in Mytilene I durst wager
Would win some words of him
Tis well bethought
She questionless with her sweet harmony
And make a battery through his deafend parts
Which now are midway stoppd
She is all happy as the fairest of all
And with her fellow maids is now upon
The leafy shelter that abuts against
The islands side
Whispers a Lord who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS
Sure alls effectless yet nothing well omit
That bears recoverys name But since your kindness
We have stretchd thus far let us beseech you
That for our gold we may provision have
Wherein we are not destitute for want
But weary for the staleness
O sir a courtesy
Which if we should deny the most just gods
For every graff would send a caterpillar
And so afflict our province Yet once more
Let me entreat to know at large the cause
Of your kings sorrow
Sit sir I will recount it to you
But see I am prevented
Reenter from the barge Lord with MARINA and a young Lady
O here is
The lady that I sent for Welcome fair one
Ist not a goodly presence
Shes a gallant lady
Shes such a one that were I well assured
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock
Ild wish no better choice and think me rarely wed
Fair one all goodness that consists in bounty
Expect even here where is a kingly patient
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
As thy desires can wish
Sir I will use
My utmost skill in his recovery Provided
That none but I and my companion maid
Be sufferd to come near him
Come let us leave her
And the gods make her prosperous
MARINA sings
Markd he your music
No nor lookd on us
See she will speak to him
Hail sir my lord lend ear
Hum ha
I am a maid
My lord that neer before invited eyes
But have been gazed on like a comet she speaks
My lord that may be hath endured a grief
Might equal yours if both were justly weighd
Though wayward fortune did malign my state
My derivation was from ancestors
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings
But time hath rooted out my parentage
And to the world and awkward casualties
Bound me in servitude
Aside
I will desist
But there is something glows upon my cheek
And whispers in mine ear Go not till he speak
My fortunesparentagegood parentage
To equal minewas it not thus what say you
I said my lord if you did know my parentage
You would not do me violence
I do think so Pray you turn your eyes upon me
You are like something thatWhat countrywoman
Here of these shores
No nor of any shores
Yet I was mortally brought forth and am
No other than I appear
I am great with woe and shall deliver weeping
My dearest wife was like this maid and such a one
My daughter might have been my queens square brows
Her stature to an inch as wandlike straight
As silvervoiced her eyes as jewellike
And cased as richly in pace another Juno
Who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry
The more she gives them speech Where do you live
Where I am but a stranger from the deck
You may discern the place
Where were you bred
And how achieved you these endowments which
You make more rich to owe
If I should tell my history it would seem
Like lies disdaind in the reporting
Prithee speak
Falseness cannot come from thee for thou lookst
Modest as Justice and thou seemst a palace
For the crownd Truth to dwell in I will
believe thee
And make my senses credit thy relation
To points that seem impossible for thou lookst
Like one I loved indeed What were thy friends
Didst thou not say when I did push thee back
Which was when I perceived theethat thou camest
From good descending
So indeed I did
Report thy parentage I think thou saidst
Thou hadst been tossd from wrong to injury
And that thou thoughtst thy griefs might equal mine
If both were opend
Some such thing
I said and said no more but what my thoughts
Did warrant me was likely
Tell thy story
If thine considerd prove the thousandth part
Of my endurance thou art a man and I
Have sufferd like a girl yet thou dost look
Like Patience gazing on kings graves and smiling
How lost thou them Thy name my most kind virgin
Recount I do beseech thee come sit by me
My name is Marina
O I am mockd
And thou by some incensed god sent hither
To make the world to laugh at me
Patience good sir
Or here Ill cease
Nay Ill be patient
Thou little knowst how thou dost startle me
To call thyself Marina
The name
Was given me by one that had some power
My father and a king
How a kings daughter
And calld Marina
You said you would believe me
But not to be a troubler of your peace
I will end here
But are you flesh and blood
Have you a working pulse and are no fairy
Motion Well speak on Where were you born
And wherefore calld Marina
Calld Marina
For I was born at sea
At sea what mother
My mother was the daughter of a king
Who died the minute I was born
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
Deliverd weeping
O stop there a little
Aside
This is the rarest dream that eer dull sleep
Did mock sad fools withal this cannot be
My daughters buried Well where were you bred
Ill hear you more to the bottom of your story
And never interrupt you
You scorn believe me twere best I did give oer
I will believe you by the syllable
Of what you shall deliver Yet give me leave
How came you in these parts where were you bred
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me
Till cruel Cleon with his wicked wife
Did seek to murder me and having wood
A villain to attempt it who having drawn to dot
A crew of pirates came and rescued me
Brought me to Mytilene But good sir
Whither will you have me Why do you weep
It may be
You think me an impostor no good faith
I am the daughter to King Pericles
If good King Pericles be
Ho Helicanus
Calls my lord
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor
Most wise in general tell me if thou canst
What this maid is or what is like to be
That thus hath made me weep
I know not but
Here is the regent sir of Mytilene
Speaks nobly of her
She would never tell
Her parentage being demanded that
She would sit still and weep
O Helicanus strike me honourd sir
Give me a gash put me to present pain
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
Oerbear the shores of my mortality
And drown me with their sweetness O come hither
Thou that begetst him that did thee beget
Thou that wast born at sea buried at Tarsus
And found at sea again O Helicanus
Down on thy knees thank the holy gods as loud
As thunder threatens us this is Marina
What was thy mothers name tell me but that
For truth can never be confirmd enough
Though doubts did ever sleep
First sir I pray
What is your title
I am Pericles of Tyre but tell me now
My drownd queens name as in the rest you said
Thou hast been godlike perfect
The heir of kingdoms and another like
To Pericles thy father
Is it no more to be your daughter than
To say my mothers name was Thaisa
Thaisa was my mother who did end
The minute I began
Now blessing on thee rise thou art my child
Give me fresh garments Mine own Helicanus
She is not dead at Tarsus as she should have been
By savage Cleon she shall tell thee all
When thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge
She is thy very princess Who is this
Sir tis the governor of Mytilene
Who hearing of your melancholy state
Did come to see you
I embrace you
Give me my robes I am wild in my beholding
O heavens bless my girl But hark what music
Tell Helicanus my Marina tell him
Oer point by point for yet he seems to doubt
How sure you are my daughter But what music
My lord I hear none
None
The music of the spheres List my Marina
It is not good to cross him give him way
Rarest sounds Do ye not hear
My lord I hear
Music
Most heavenly music
It nips me unto listening and thick slumber
Hangs upon mine eyes let me rest
Sleeps
A pillow for his head
So leave him all Well my companion friends
If this but answer to my just belief
Ill well remember you
Exeunt all but PERICLES
DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision
My temple stands in Ephesus hie thee thither
And do upon mine altar sacrifice
There when my maiden priests are met together
Before the people all
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife
To mourn thy crosses with thy daughters call
And give them repetition to the life
Or perform my bidding or thou livest in woe
Do it and happy by my silver bow
Awake and tell thy dream
Disappears
Celestial Dian goddess argentine
I will obey thee Helicanus
Reenter HELICANUS LYSIMACHUS and MARINA
Sir
My purpose was for Tarsus there to strike
The inhospitable Cleon but I am
For other service first toward Ephesus
Turn our blown sails eftsoons Ill tell thee why
To LYSIMACHUS
Shall we refresh us sir upon your shore
And give you gold for such provision
As our intents will need
Sir
With all my heart and when you come ashore
I have another suit
You shall prevail
Were it to woo my daughter for it seems
You have been noble towards her
Sir lend me your arm
Come my Marina
Exeunt
Enter GOWER before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus
Now our sands are almost run
More a little and then dumb
This my last boon give me
For such kindness must relieve me
That you aptly will suppose
What pageantry what feats what shows
What minstrelsy and pretty din
The regent made in Mytilene
To greet the king So he thrived
That he is promised to be wived
To fair Marina but in no wise
Till he had done his sacrifice
As Dian bade whereto being bound
The interim pray you all confound
In featherd briefness sails are filld
And wishes fall out as theyre willd
At Ephesus the temple see
Our king and all his company
That he can hither come so soon
Is by your fancys thankful doom
Exit
near the altar as high priestess a number of
Virgins on each side CERIMON and other Inhabitants
of Ephesus attending
Enter PERICLES with his train LYSIMACHUS HELICANUS MARINA and a Lady
Hail Dian to perform thy just command
I here confess myself the king of Tyre
Who frighted from my country did wed
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa
At sea in childbed died she but brought forth
A maidchild calld Marina who O goddess
Wears yet thy silver livery She at Tarsus
Was nursed with Cleon who at fourteen years
He sought to murder but her better stars
Brought her to Mytilene gainst whose shore
Riding her fortunes brought the maid aboard us
Where by her own most clear remembrance she
Made known herself my daughter
Voice and favour
You are you areO royal Pericles
Faints
What means the nun she dies help gentlemen
Noble sir
If you have told Dianas altar true
This is your wife
Reverend appearer no
I threw her overboard with these very arms
Upon this coast I warrant you
Tis most certain
Look to the lady O shes but oerjoyd
Early in blustering morn this lady was
Thrown upon this shore I oped the coffin
Found there rich jewels recoverd her and placed her
Here in Dianas temple
May we see them
Great sir they shall be brought you to my house
Whither I invite you Look Thaisa is recovered
O let me look
If he be none of mine my sanctity
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear
But curb it spite of seeing O my lord
Are you not Pericles Like him you spake
Like him you are did you not name a tempest
A birth and death
The voice of dead Thaisa
That Thaisa am I supposed dead
And drownd
Immortal Dian
Now I know you better
When we with tears parted Pentapolis
The king my father gave you such a ring
Shows a ring
This this no more you gods your present kindness
Makes my past miseries sports you shall do well
That on the touching of her lips I may
Melt and no more be seen O come be buried
A second time within these arms
My heart
Leaps to be gone into my mothers bosom
Kneels to THAISA
Look who kneels here Flesh of thy flesh Thaisa
Thy burden at the sea and calld Marina
For she was yielded there
Blest and mine own
Hail madam and my queen
I know you not
You have heard me say when I did fly from Tyre
I left behind an ancient substitute
Can you remember what I calld the man
I have named him oft
Twas Helicanus then
Still confirmation
Embrace him dear Thaisa this is he
Now do I long to hear how you were found
How possibly preserved and who to thank
Besides the gods for this great miracle
Lord Cerimon my lord this man
Through whom the gods have shown their power that can
From first to last resolve you
Reverend sir
The gods can have no mortal officer
More like a god than you Will you deliver
How this dead queen relives
I will my lord
Beseech you first go with me to my house
Where shall be shown you all was found with her
How she came placed here in the temple
No needful thing omitted
Pure Dian bless thee for thy vision I
Will offer nightoblations to thee Thaisa
This prince the fairbetrothed of your daughter
Shall marry her at Pentapolis And now
This ornament
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form
And what this fourteen years no razor touchd
To grace thy marriageday Ill beautify
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit sir
My fathers dead
Heavens make a star of him Yet there my queen
Well celebrate their nuptials and ourselves
Will in that kingdom spend our following days
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign
Lord Cerimon we do our longing stay
To hear the rest untold sir leads the way
Exeunt
Enter GOWER
In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward
In Pericles his queen and daughter seen
Although assaild with fortune fierce and keen
Virtue preserved from fell destructions blast
Led on by heaven and crownd with joy at last
In Helicanus may you well descry
A figure of truth of faith of loyalty
In reverend Cerimon there well appears
The worth that learned charity aye wears
For wicked Cleon and his wife when fame
Had spread their cursed deed and honourd name
Of Pericles to rage the city turn
That him and his they in his palace burn
The gods for murder seemed so content
To punish them although not done but meant
So on your patience evermore attending
New joy wait on you Here our play has ending
Exit
Enter KING RICHARD II JOHN OF GAUNT with other Nobles and Attendants
Old John of Gaunt timehonourd Lancaster
Hast thou according to thy oath and band
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal
Which then our leisure would not let us hear
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
I have my liege
Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice
Or worthily as a good subject should
On some known ground of treachery in him
As near as I could sift him on that argument
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aimd at your highness no inveterate malice
Then call them to our presence face to face
And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak
Highstomachd are they both and full of ire
In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY
Many years of happy days befal
My gracious sovereign my most loving liege
Each day still better others happiness
Until the heavens envying earths good hap
Add an immortal title to your crown
We thank you both yet one but flatters us
As well appeareth by the cause you come
Namely to appeal each other of high treason
Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
First heaven be the record to my speech
In the devotion of a subjects love
Tendering the precious safety of my prince
And free from other misbegotten hate
Come I appellant to this princely presence
Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee
And mark my greeting well for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant
Too good to be so and too bad to live
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
Once more the more to aggravate the note
With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat
And wish so please my sovereign ere I move
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
Tis not the trial of a womans war
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
The blood is hot that must be coold for this
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hushd and nought at all to say
First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech
Which else would post until it had returnd
These terms of treason doubled down his throat
Setting aside his high bloods royalty
And let him be no kinsman to my liege
I do defy him and I spit at him
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain
Which to maintain I would allow him odds
And meet him were I tied to run afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps
Or any other ground inhabitable
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot
Mean time let this defend my loyalty
By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king
And lay aside my high bloods royalty
Which fear not reverence makes thee to except
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop
By that and all the rites of knighthood else
Will I make good against thee arm to arm
What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise
I take it up and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
Ill answer thee in any fair degree
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial
And when I mount alive may I not light
If I be traitor or unjustly fight
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays charge
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him
Look what I speak my life shall prove it true
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your highness soldiers
The which he hath detaind for lewd employments
Like a false traitor and injurious villain
Besides I say and will in battle prove
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That ever was surveyd by English eye
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death
Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries
And consequently like a traitor coward
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood
Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
To me for justice and rough chastisement
And by the glorious worth of my descent
This arm shall do it or this life be spent
How high a pitch his resolution soars
Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this
O let my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf
Till I have told this slander of his blood
How God and good men hate so foul a liar
Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
Were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir
As he is but my fathers brothers son
Now by my sceptres awe I make a vow
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul
He is our subject Mowbray so art thou
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow
Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness soldiers
The other part reserved I by consent
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen
Now swallow down that lie For Gloucesters death
I slew him not but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case
For you my noble Lord of Lancaster
The honourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received the sacrament
Your graces pardon and I hope I had it
This is my fault as for the rest appealld
It issues from the rancour of a villain
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitors foot
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom
In haste whereof most heartily I pray
Your highness to assign our trial day
Wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me
Lets purge this choler without letting blood
This we prescribe though no physician
Deep malice makes too deep incision
Forget forgive conclude and be agreed
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed
Good uncle let this end where it begun
Well calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son
To be a makepeace shall become my age
Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolks gage
And Norfolk throw down his
When Harry when
Obedience bids I should not bid again
Norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot
Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot
My life thou shalt command but not my shame
The one my duty owes but my fair name
Despite of death that lives upon my grave
To dark dishonours use thou shalt not have
I am disgraced impeachd and baffled here
Pierced to the soul with slanders venomd spear
The which no balm can cure but his heartblood
Which breathed this poison
Rage must be withstood
Give me his gage lions make leopards tame
Yea but not change his spots take but my shame
And I resign my gage My dear dear lord
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation that away
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay
A jewel in a tentimesbarrdup chest
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
Mine honour is my life both grow in one
Take honour from me and my life is done
Then dear my liege mine honour let me try
In that I live and for that will I die
Cousin throw up your gage do you begin
O God defend my soul from such deep sin
Shall I seem crestfalln in my fathers sight
Or with pale beggarfear impeach my height
Before this outdared dastard Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbrays face
Exit JOHN OF GAUNT
We were not born to sue but to command
Which since we cannot do to make you friends
Be ready as your lives shall answer it
At Coventry upon Saint Lamberts day
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate
Since we can not atone you we shall see
Justice design the victors chivalry
Lord marshal command our officers at arms
Be ready to direct these home alarms
Exeunt
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS
Alas the part I had in Woodstocks blood
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims
To stir against the butchers of his life
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that we cannot correct
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
Who when they see the hours ripe on earth
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire
Edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood
Or seven fair branches springing from one root
Some of those seven are dried by natures course
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut
But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester
One vial full of Edwards sacred blood
One flourishing branch of his most royal root
Is crackd and all the precious liquor spilt
Is hackd down and his summer leaves all faded
By envys hand and murders bloody axe
Ah Gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
That metal that selfmould that fashiond thee
Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
Yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy fathers death
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die
Who was the model of thy fathers life
Call it not patience Gaunt it is despair
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughterd
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
What shall I say to safeguard thine own life
The best way is to venge my Gloucesters death
Gods is the quarrel for Gods substitute
His deputy anointed in His sight
Hath caused his death the which if wrongfully
Let heaven revenge for I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister
Where then alas may I complain myself
To God the widows champion and defence
Why then I will Farewell old Gaunt
Thou goest to Coventry there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight
O sit my husbands wrongs on Herefords spear
That it may enter butcher Mowbrays breast
Or if misfortune miss the first career
Be Mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom
They may break his foaming coursers back
And throw the rider headlong in the lists
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford
Farewell old Gaunt thy sometimes brothers wife
With her companion grief must end her life
Sister farewell I must to Coventry
As much good stay with thee as go with me
Yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls
Not with the empty hollowness but weight
I take my leave before I have begun
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
Commend me to thy brother Edmund York
Lo this is allnay yet depart not so
Though this be all do not so quickly go
I shall remember more Bid himah what
With all good speed at Plashy visit me
Alack and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnishd walls
Unpeopled offices untrodden stones
And what hear there for welcome but my groans
Therefore commend me let him not come there
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where
Desolate desolate will I hence and die
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye
Exeunt
Enter the Lord Marshal and the DUKE OF AUMERLE
My Lord Aumerle is Harry Hereford armd
Yea at all points and longs to enter in
The Duke of Norfolk sprightfully and bold
Stays but the summons of the appellants trumpet
Why then the champions are prepared and stay
For nothing but his majestys approach
The trumpets sound and KING RICHARD enters with  his nobles JOHN OF GAUNT BUSHY BAGOT GREEN and  others When they are set enter THOMAS MOWBRAY in arms defendant with a Herald
Marshal demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause
In Gods name and the kings say who thou art
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms
Against what man thou comest and what thy quarrel
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour
My name is Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
Who hither come engaged by my oath
Which God defend a knight should violate
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God my king and my succeeding issue
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
And by the grace of God and this mine arm
To prove him in defending of myself
A traitor to my God my king and me
And as I truly fight defend me heaven
The trumpets sound Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE appellant in armour with a Herald
Marshal ask yonder knight in arms
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war
And formally according to our law

Before King Richard in his royal lists
Against whom comest thou and whats thy quarrel
Speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven
Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
Am I who ready here do stand in arms
To prove by Gods grace and my bodys valour
In lists on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
That he is a traitor foul and dangerous
To God of heaven King Richard and to me
And as I truly fight defend me heaven
On pain of death no person be so bold
Or daringhardy as to touch the lists
Except the marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs
Lord marshal let me kiss my sovereigns hand
And bow my knee before his majesty
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends
The appellant in all duty greets your highness
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave
We will descend and fold him in our arms
Cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right
So be thy fortune in this royal fight
Farewell my blood which if today thou shed
Lament we may but not revenge thee dead
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me if I be gored with Mowbrays spear
As confident as is the falcons flight
Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight
My loving lord I take my leave of you
Of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle
Not sick although I have to do with death
But lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
Lo as at English feasts so I regreet
The daintiest last to make the end most sweet
O thou the earthly author of my blood
Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
To reach at victory above my head
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
And with thy blessings steel my lances point
That it may enter Mowbrays waxen coat
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt
Even in the lusty havior of his son
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous
Be swift like lightning in the execution
And let thy blows doubly redoubled
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy
Rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive
However God or fortune cast my lot
There lives or dies true to King Richards throne
A loyal just and upright gentleman
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontrolld enfranchisement
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
This feast of battle with mine adversary
Most mighty liege and my companion peers
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight truth hath a quiet breast
Farewell my lord securely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye
Order the trial marshal and begin
Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
Receive thy lance and God defend the right
Strong as a tower in hope I cry amen
Go bear this lance to Thomas Duke of Norfolk
Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
Stands here for God his sovereign and himself
On pain to be found false and recreant
To prove the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
A traitor to his God his king and him
And dares him to set forward to the fight
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
On pain to be found false and recreant
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
To God his sovereign and to him disloyal
Courageously and with a free desire
Attending but the signal to begin
Sound trumpets and set forward combatants
A charge sounded
Stay the king hath thrown his warder down
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears
And both return back to their chairs again
Withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree
A long flourish
Draw near
And list what with our council we have done
For that our kingdoms earth should not be soild
With that dear blood which it hath fostered
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds ploughd up with neighbours sword
And for we think the eaglewinged pride
Of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts
With rivalhating envy set on you
To wake our peace which in our countrys cradle
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums
With harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
And make us wade even in our kindreds blood
Therefore we banish you our territories
You cousin Hereford upon pain of life
Till twice five summers have enrichd our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions
But tread the stranger paths of banishment
Your will be done this must my comfort be
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me
And those his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment
Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile
The hopeless word of never to return
Breathe I against thee upon pain of life
A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
And all unlookd for from your highness mouth
A dearer merit not so deep a maim
As to be cast forth in the common air
Have I deserved at your highness hands
The language I have learnd these forty years
My native English now I must forego
And now my tongues use is to me no more
Than an unstringed viol or a harp
Or like a cunning instrument cased up
Or being open put into his hands
That knows no touch to tune the harmony
Within my mouth you have engaold my tongue
Doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse
Too far in years to be a pupil now
What is thy sentence then but speechless death
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
It boots thee not to be compassionate
After our sentence plaining comes too late
Then thus I turn me from my countrys light
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night
Return again and take an oath with thee
Lay on our royal sword your banishd hands
Swear by the duty that you owe to God
Our part therein we banish with yourselves
To keep the oath that we administer
You never shall so help you truth and God
Embrace each others love in banishment
Nor never look upon each others face
Nor never write regreet nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your homebred hate
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot contrive or complot any ill
Gainst us our state our subjects or our land
I swear
And I to keep all this
Norfolk so far as to mine enemy
By this time had the king permitted us
One of our souls had wanderd in the air
Banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
As now our flesh is banishd from this land
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
Since thou hast far to go bear not along
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul
No Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor
My name be blotted from the book of life
And I from heaven banishd as from hence
But what thou art God thou and I do know
And all too soon I fear the king shall rue
Farewell my liege Now no way can I stray
Save back to England all the worlds my way
Exit
Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect
Hath from the number of his banishd years
Pluckd four away
To HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Six frozen winter spent
Return with welcome home from banishment
How long a time lies in one little word
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word such is the breath of kings
I thank my liege that in regard of me
He shortens four years of my sons exile
But little vantage shall I reap thereby
For ere the six years that he hath to spend
Can change their moons and bring their times about
My oildried lamp and timebewasted light
Shall be extinct with age and endless night
My inch of taper will be burnt and done
And blindfold death not let me see my son
Why uncle thou hast many years to live
But not a minute king that thou canst give
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
Thy word is current with him for my death
But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
Thy son is banishd upon good advice
Whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave
Why at our justice seemst thou then to lour
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
You urged me as a judge but I had rather
You would have bid me argue like a father
O had it been a stranger not my child
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild
A partial slander sought I to avoid
And in the sentence my own life destroyd
Alas I lookd when some of you should say
I was too strict to make mine own away
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong
Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
Six years we banish him and he shall go
Flourish Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train
Cousin farewell what presence must not know
From where you do remain let paper show
My lord no leave take I for I will ride
As far as land will let me by your side
O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends
I have too few to take my leave of you
When the tongues office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time
Joy absent grief is present for that time
What is six winters they are quickly gone
To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
The precious jewel of thy home return
Nay rather every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages and in the end
Having my freedom boast of nothing else
But that I was a journeyman to grief
All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens
Teach thy necessity to reason thus
There is no virtue like necessity
Think not the king did banish thee
But thou the king Woe doth the heavier sit
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne
Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
And not the king exiled thee or suppose
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art flying to a fresher clime
Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
To lie that way thou gost not whence thou comest
Suppose the singing birds musicians
The grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd
The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it light
O who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summers heat
O no the apprehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse
Fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more
Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore
Come come my son Ill bring thee on thy way
Had I thy youth and cause I would not stay
Then Englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu
My mother and my nurse that bears me yet
Whereer I wander boast of this I can
Though banishd yet a trueborn Englishman
Exeunt
Enter KING RICHARD II with BAGOT and GREEN at one door and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another
We did observe Cousin Aumerle
How far brought you high Hereford on his way
I brought high Hereford if you call him so
But to the next highway and there I left him
And say what store of parting tears were shed
Faith none for me except the northeast wind
Which then blew bitterly against our faces
Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear
What said our cousin when you parted with him
Farewell
And for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seemd buried in my sorrows grave
Marry would the word farewell have lengthend hours
And added years to his short banishment
He should have had a volume of farewells
But since it would not he had none of me
He is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
When time shall call him home from banishment
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends
Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship to the common people
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy
What reverence he did throw away on slaves
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune
As twere to banish their affects with him
Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee
With Thanks my countrymen my loving friends
As were our England in reversion his
And he our subjects next degree in hope
Well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland
Expedient manage must be made my liege
Ere further leisure yield them further means
For their advantage and your highness loss
We will ourself in person to this war
And for our coffers with too great a court
And liberal largess are grown somewhat light
We are inforced to farm our royal realm
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand if that come short
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
Whereto when they shall know what men are rich
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them after to supply our wants
For we will make for Ireland presently
Enter BUSHY
Bushy what news
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord
Suddenly taken and hath sent post haste
To entreat your majesty to visit him
Where lies he
At Ely House
Now put it God in the physicians mind
To help him to his grave immediately
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars
Come gentlemen lets all go visit him
Pray God we may make haste and come too late
Amen
Exeunt
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick with the DUKE OF YORK and c
Will the king come that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear
O but they say the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony
Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
He that no more must say is listend more
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
More are mens ends markd than their lives before
The setting sun and music at the close
As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
Writ in remembrance more than things long past
Though Richard my lifes counsel would not hear
My deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear
No it is stoppd with other flattering sounds
As praises of whose taste the wise are fond
Lascivious metres to whose venom sound
The open ear of youth doth always listen
Report of fashions in proud Italy
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
So it be new theres no respect how vile
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard
Where will doth mutiny with wits regard
Direct not him whose way himself will choose
Tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do foretell of him
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
For violent fires soon burn out themselves
Small showers last long but sudden storms are short
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
Light vanity insatiate cormorant
Consuming means soon preys upon itself
This royal throne of kings this scepterd isle
This earth of majesty this seat of Mars
This other Eden demiparadise
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war
This happy breed of men this little world
This precious stone set in the silver sea
Which serves it in the office of a wall
Or as a moat defensive to a house
Against the envy of less happier lands
This blessed plot this earth this realm this England
This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
Feard by their breed and famous by their birth
Renowned for their deeds as far from home
For Christian service and true chivalry
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
Of the worlds ransom blessed Marys Son
This land of such dear souls this dear dear land
Dear for her reputation through the world
Is now leased out I die pronouncing it
Like to a tenement or pelting farm
England bound in with the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Of watery Neptune is now bound in with shame
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
That England that was wont to conquer others
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself
Ah would the scandal vanish with my life
How happy then were my ensuing death
Enter KING RICHARD II and QUEEN DUKE OF AUMERLE  BUSHY GREEN BAGOT LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY
The king is come deal mildly with his youth
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more
How fares our noble uncle Lancaster
What comfort man how ist with aged Gaunt
O how that name befits my composition
Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
For sleeping England long time have I watchd
Watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon
Is my strict fast I mean my childrens looks
And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
Can sick men play so nicely with their names
No misery makes sport to mock itself
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
I mock my name great king to flatter thee
Should dying men flatter with those that live
No no men living flatter those that die
Thou now adying sayst thou flatterest me
O no thou diest though I the sicker be
I am in health I breathe and see thee ill
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill
Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick
And thou too careless patient as thou art
Commitst thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians that first wounded thee
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head
And yet incaged in so small a verge
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land
O had thy grandsire with a prophets eye
Seen how his sons son should destroy his sons
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
Deposing thee before thou wert possessd
Which art possessd now to depose thyself
Why cousin wert thou regent of the world
It were a shame to let this land by lease
But for thy world enjoying but this land
Is it not more than shame to shame it so
Landlord of England art thou now not king
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law And thou
A lunatic leanwitted fool
Presuming on an agues privilege
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
With fury from his native residence
Now by my seats right royal majesty
Wert thou not brother to great Edwards son
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
O spare me not my brother Edwards son
For that I was his father Edwards son
That blood already like the pelican
Hast thou tappd out and drunkenly caroused
My brother Gloucester plain wellmeaning soul
Whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls
May be a precedent and witness good
That thou respectst not spilling Edwards blood
Join with the present sickness that I have
And thy unkindness be like crooked age
To crop at once a too long witherd flower
Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
These words hereafter thy tormentors be
Convey me to my bed then to my grave
Love they to live that love and honour have
Exit borne off by his Attendants
And let them die that age and sullens have
For both hast thou and both become the grave
I do beseech your majesty impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him
He loves you on my life and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford were he here
Right you say true as Herefords love so his
As theirs so mine and all be as it is
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
My liege old Gaunt commends him to your majesty
What says he
Nay nothing all is said
His tongue is now a stringless instrument
Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so
Though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
His time is spent our pilgrimage must be
So much for that Now for our Irish wars
We must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns
Which live like venom where no venom else
But only they have privilege to live
And for these great affairs do ask some charge
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate corn revenues and moveables
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessd
How long shall I be patient ah how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
Not Gloucesters death nor Herefords banishment
Not Gaunts rebukes nor Englands private wrongs
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage nor my own disgrace
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face
I am the last of noble Edwards sons
Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first
In war was never lion raged more fierce
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild
Than was that young and princely gentleman
His face thou hast for even so lookd he
Accomplishd with the number of thy hours
But when he frownd it was against the French
And not against his friends his noble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant fathers hand had won
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood
But bloody with the enemies of his kin
O Richard York is too far gone with grief
Or else he never would compare between
Why uncle whats the matter
O my liege
Pardon me if you please if n ot I pleased
Not to be pardond am content withal
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banishd Hereford
Is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live
Was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true
Did not the one deserve to have an heir
Is not his heir a welldeserving son
Take Herefords rights away and take from Time
His charters and his customary rights
Let not tomorrow then ensue today
Be not thyself for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession
Now afore GodGod forbid I say true
If you do wrongfully seize Herefords rights
Call in the letters patent that he hath
By his attorneysgeneral to sue
His livery and deny his offerd homage
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head
You lose a thousand welldisposed hearts
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think
Think what you will we seize into our hands
His plate his goods his money and his lands
Ill not be by the while my liege farewell
What will ensue hereof theres none can tell
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good
Exit
Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
To see this business Tomorrow next
We will for Ireland and tis time I trow
And we create in absence of ourself
Our uncle York lord governor of England
For he is just and always loved us well
Come on our queen tomorrow must we part
Be merry for our time of stay is short
Flourish Exeunt KING RICHARD II QUEEN DUKE OF AUMERLE BUSHY GREEN and BAGOT
Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead
And living too for now his son is duke
Barely in title not in revenue
Richly in both if justice had her right
My heart is great but it must break with silence
Eret be disburdend with a liberal tongue
Nay speak thy mind and let him neer speak more
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford
If it be so out with it boldly man
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
No good at all that I can do for him
Unless you call it good to pity him
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony
Now afore God tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him a royal prince and many moe
Of noble blood in this declining land
The king is not himself but basely led
By flatterers and what they will inform
Merely in hate gainst any of us all
That will the king severely prosecute
Gainst us our lives our children and our heirs
The commons hath he pilld with grievous taxes
And quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined
For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
As blanks benevolences and I wot not what
But what o Gods name doth become of this
Wars have not wasted it for warrd he hath not
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm
The kings grown bankrupt like a broken man
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
He hath not money for these Irish wars
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding
But by the robbing of the banishd duke
His noble kinsman most degenerate king
But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails
And yet we strike not but securely perish
We see the very wreck that we must suffer
And unavoided is the danger now
For suffering so the causes of our wreck
Not so even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering but I dare not say
How near the tidings of our comfort is
Nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
Be confident to speak Northumberland
We three are but thyself and speaking so
Thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold
Then thus I have from Port le Blanc a bay
In Brittany received intelligence
That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter
His brother Archbishop late of Canterbury
Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston
Sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint
All these well furnishd by the Duke of Bretagne
With eight tall ships three thousand men of war
Are making hither with all due expedience
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore
Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
The first departing of the king for Ireland
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
Imp out our drooping countrys broken wing
Redeem from broking pawn the blemishd crown
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptres gilt
And make high majesty look like itself
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh
But if you faint as fearing to do so
Stay and be secret and myself will go
To horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear
Hold out my horse and I will first be there
Exeunt
Enter QUEEN BUSHY and BAGOT
Madam your majesty is too much sad
You promised when you parted with the king
To lay aside lifeharming heaviness
And entertain a cheerful disposition
To please the king I did to please myself
I cannot do it yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard yet again methinks
Some unborn sorrow ripe in fortunes womb
Is coming towards me and my inward soul
With nothing trembles at some thing it grieves
More than with parting from my lord the king
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
Which shows like grief itself but is not so
For sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears
Divides one thing entire to many objects
Like perspectives which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but confusion eyed awry
Distinguish form so your sweet majesty
Looking awry upon your lords departure
Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
Which lookd on as it is is nought but shadows
Of what it is not Then thricegracious queen
More than your lords departure weep not mores not seen
Or if it be tis with false sorrows eye
Which for things true weeps things imaginary
It may be so but yet my inward soul
Persuades me it is otherwise howeer it be
I cannot but be sad so heavy sad
As though on thinking on no thought I think
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
Tis nothing less conceit is still derived
From some forefather grief mine is not so
For nothing had begot my something grief
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve
Tis in reversion that I do possess
But what it is that is not yet known what
I cannot name tis nameless woe I wot
Enter GREEN
God save your majesty and well met gentlemen
I hope the king is not yet shippd for Ireland
Why hopest thou so tis better hope he is
For his designs crave haste his haste good hope
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shippd
That he our hope might have retired his power
And driven into despair an enemys hope
Who strongly hath set footing in this land
The banishd Bolingbroke repeals himself
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
At Ravenspurgh
Now God in heaven forbid
Ah madam tis too true and that is worse
The Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy
The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby
With all their powerful friends are fled to him
Why have you not proclaimd Northumberland
We have whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staff resignd his stewardship
And all the household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke
So Green thou art the midwife to my woe
And Bolingbroke my sorrows dismal heir
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
And I a gasping newdeliverd mother
Have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joind
Despair not madam
Who shall hinder me
I will despair and be at enmity
With cozening hope he is a flatterer
A parasite a keeper back of death
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life
Which false hope lingers in extremity
Enter DUKE OF YORK
Here comes the Duke of York
With signs of war about his aged neck
O full of careful business are his looks
Uncle for Gods sake speak comfortable words
Should I do so I should belie my thoughts
Comforts in heaven and we are on the earth
Where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
Your husband he is gone to save far off
Whilst others come to make him lose at home
Here am I left to underprop his land
Who weak with age cannot support myself
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made
Now shall he try his friends that flatterd him
Enter a Servant
My lord your son was gone before I came
He was Why so go all which way it will
The nobles they are fled the commons they are cold
And will I fear revolt on Herefords side
Sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound
Hold take my ring
My lord I had forgot to tell your lordship
Today as I came by I called there
But I shall grieve you to report the rest
What ist knave
An hour before I came the duchess died
God for his mercy what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once
I know not what to do I would to God
So my untruth had not provoked him to it
The king had cut off my head with my brothers
What are there no posts dispatchd for Ireland
How shall we do for money for these wars
Come sistercousin I would saypray pardon me
Go fellow get thee home provide some carts
And bring away the armour that is there
Exit Servant
Gentlemen will you go muster men
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands
Never believe me Both are my kinsmen
The one is my sovereign whom both my oath
And duty bids defend the other again
Is my kinsman whom the king hath wrongd
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
Well somewhat we must do Come cousin Ill
Dispose of you
Gentlemen go muster up your men
And meet me presently at Berkeley
I should to Plashy too
But time will not permit all is uneven
And every thing is left at six and seven
Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland
But none returns For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible
Besides our nearness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king
And thats the wavering commons for their love
Lies in their purses and whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
Wherein the king stands generally condemnd
If judgement lie in them then so do we
Because we ever have been near the king
Well I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there
Thither will I with you for little office
The hateful commons will perform for us
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces
Will you go along with us
No I will to Ireland to his majesty
Farewell if hearts presages be not vain
We three here art that neer shall meet again
Thats as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke
Alas poor duke the task he undertakes
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry
Where one on his side fights thousands will fly
Farewell at once for once for all and ever
Well we may meet again
I fear me never
Exeunt
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND with Forces
How far is it my lord to Berkeley now
Believe me noble lord
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
Making the hard way sweet and delectable
But I bethink me what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company
Which I protest hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and process of my travel
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
The present benefit which I possess
And hope to joy is little less in joy
Than hope enjoyd by this the weary lords
Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
By sight of what I have your noble company
Of much less value is my company
Than your good words But who comes here
Enter HENRY PERCY
It is my son young Harry Percy
Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever
Harry how fares your uncle
I had thought my lord to have learnd his health of you
Why is he not with the queen
No my good Lord he hath forsook the court
Broken his staff of office and dispersed
The household of the king
What was his reason
He was not so resolved when last we spake together
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford
And sent me over by Berkeley to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy
No my good lord for that is not forgot
Which neer I did remember to my knowledge
I never in my life did look on him
Then learn to know him now this is the duke
My gracious lord I tender you my service
Such as it is being tender raw and young
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert
I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure
I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends
And as my fortune ripens with thy love
It shall be still thy true loves recompense
My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
How far is it to Berkeley and what stir
Keeps good old York there with his men of war
There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
Mannd with three hundred men as I have heard
And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour
None else of name and noble estimate
Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby
Bloody with spurring fieryred with haste
Welcome my lords I wot your love pursues
A banishd traitor all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrichd
Shall be your love and labours recompense
Your presence makes us rich most noble lord
And far surmounts our labour to attain it
Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
Which till my infant fortune comes to years
Stands for my bounty But who comes here
Enter LORD BERKELEY
It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess
My Lord of Hereford my message is to you
My lord my answer isto Lancaster
And I am come to seek that name in England
And I must find that title in your tongue
Before I make reply to aught you say
Mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
To raze one title of your honour out
To you my lord I come what lord you will
From the most gracious regent of this land
The Duke of York to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent time
And fright our native peace with selfborn arms
Enter DUKE OF YORK attended
I shall not need transport my words by you
Here comes his grace in person My noble uncle
Kneels
Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
Whose duty is deceiveable and false
My gracious uncle
Tut tut
Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
I am no traitors uncle and that word grace
In an ungracious mouth is but profane
Why have those banishd and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch a dust of Englands ground
But then more why why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom
Frighting her palefaced villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence
Why foolish boy the king is left behind
And in my loyal bosom lies his power
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself
Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men
From forth the ranks of many thousand French
O then how quickly should this arm of mine
Now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
And minister correction to thy fault
My gracious uncle let me know my fault
On what condition stands it and wherein
Even in condition of the worst degree
In gross rebellion and detested treason
Thou art a banishd man and here art come
Before the expiration of thy time
In braving arms against thy sovereign
As I was banishd I was banishd Hereford
But as I come I come for Lancaster
And noble uncle I beseech your grace
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
You are my father for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive O then my father
Will you permit that I shall stand condemnd
A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
Pluckd from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born
If that my cousin king be King of England
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster
You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin
Had you first died and he been thus trod down
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
I am denied to sue my livery here
And yet my letterspatents give me leave
My fathers goods are all distraind and sold
And these and all are all amiss employd
What would you have me do I am a subject
And I challenge law attorneys are denied me
And therefore personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent
The noble duke hath been too much abused
It stands your grace upon to do him right
Base men by his endowments are made great
My lords of England let me tell you this
I have had feeling of my cousins wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right
But in this kind to come in braving arms
Be his own carver and cut out his way
To find out right with wrong it may not be
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own and for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid
And let him neer see joy that breaks that oath
Well well I see the issue of these arms
I cannot mend it I must needs confess
Because my power is weak and all ill left
But if I could by Him that gave me life
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king
But since I cannot be it known to you
I do remain as neuter So fare you well
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night
An offer uncle that we will accept
But we must win your grace to go with us
To Bristol castle which they say is held
By Bushy Bagot and their complices
The caterpillars of the commonwealth
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away
It may be I will go with you but yet Ill pause
For I am loath to break our countrys laws
Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
Things past redress are now with me past care
Exeunt
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain
My lord of Salisbury we have stayd ten days
And hardly kept our countrymen together
And yet we hear no tidings from the king
Therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell
Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee
Tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
The baytrees in our country are all witherd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
The palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth
And leanlookd prophets whisper fearful change
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy
The other to enjoy by rage and war
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings
Farewell our countrymen are gone and fled
As well assured Richard their king is dead
Exit
Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base earth from the firmament
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes
Exit
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE DUKE OF YORK  NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ROSS HENRY PERCY LORD WILLOUGHBY with BUSHY and GREEN prisoners
Bring forth these men
Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls
Since presently your souls must part your bodies
With too much urging your pernicious lives
For twere no charity yet to wash your blood
From off my hands here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths
You have misled a prince a royal king
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
By you unhappied and disfigured clean
You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
Broke the possession of a royal bed
And staind the beauty of a fair queens cheeks
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
Myself a prince by fortune of my birth
Near to the king in blood and near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me
Have stoopd my neck under your injuries
And sighd my English breath in foreign clouds
Eating the bitter bread of banishment
Whilst you have fed upon my signories
Disparkd my parks and felld my forest woods
From my own windows torn my household coat
Razed out my imprese leaving me no sign
Save mens opinions and my living blood
To show the world I am a gentleman
This and much more much more than twice all this
Condemns you to the death See them deliverd over
To execution and the hand of death
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewell
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell
My Lord Northumberland see them dispatchd
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others with the prisoners
Uncle you say the queen is at your house
For Gods sake fairly let her be entreated
Tell her I send to her my kind commends
Take special care my greetings be deliverd
A gentleman of mine I have dispatchd
With letters of your love to her at large
Thank gentle uncle Come lords away
To fight with Glendower and his complices
Awhile to work and after holiday
Exeunt
Drums flourish and colours Enter KING RICHARD II the BISHOP OF CARLISLE DUKE OF AUMERLE and Soldiers
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand
Yea my lord How brooks your grace the air
After your late tossing on the breaking seas
Needs must I like it well I weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again
Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand
Though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs
As a longparted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
So weeping smiling greet I thee my earth
And do thee favours with my royal hands
Feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
And heavygaited toads lie in their way
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with usurping steps do trample thee
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies
Mock not my senseless conjuration lords
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellions arms
Fear not my lord that Power that made you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all
The means that heaven yields must be embraced
And not neglected else if heaven would
And we will not heavens offer we refuse
The profferd means of succor and redress
He means my lord that we are too remiss
Whilst Bolingbroke through our security
Grows strong and great in substance and in power
Discomfortable cousin knowst thou not
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
Behind the globe that lights the lower world
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage boldly here
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole
Then murders treasons and detested sins
The cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs
Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke
Who all this while hath revelld in the night
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes
Shall see us rising in our throne the east
His treasons will sit blushing in his face
Not able to endure the sight of day
But selfaffrighted tremble at his sin
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord
For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressd
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel then if angels fight
Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY
Welcome my lordhow far off lies your power
Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
Than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but despair
One day too late I fear me noble lord
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
O call back yesterday bid time return
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
Today today unhappy day too late
Oerthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state
For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead
Are gone to Bolingbroke dispersed and fled
Comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face and they are fled
And till so much blood thither come again
Have I not reason to look pale and dead
All souls that will be safe fly from my side
For time hath set a blot upon my pride
Comfort my liege remember who you are
I had forgot myself am I not king
Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
Is not the kings name twenty thousand names
Arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory Look not to the ground
Ye favourites of a king are we not high
High be our thoughts I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here
Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
More health and happiness betide my liege
Than can my caretuned tongue deliver him
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
Say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
And what loss is it to be rid of care
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we
Greater he shall not be if he serve God
Well serve Him too and be his fellow so
Revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
They break their faith to God as well as us
Cry woe destruction ruin and decay
The worst is death and death will have his day
Glad am I that your highness is so armd
To bear the tidings of calamity
Like an unseasonable stormy day
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
As if the world were all dissolved to tears
So high above his limits swells the rage
Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
Whitebeards have armd their thin and hairless scalps
Against thy majesty boys with womens voices
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of doublefatal yew against thy state
Yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills
Against thy seat both young and old rebel
And all goes worse than I have power to tell
Too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire where is Bagot
What is become of Bushy where is Green
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps
If we prevail their heads shall pay for it
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke
Peace have they made with him indeed my lord
O villains vipers damnd without redemption
Dogs easily won to fawn on any man
Snakes in my heartblood warmd that sting my heart
Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas
Would they make peace terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence
Sweet love I see changing his property
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
Again uncurse their souls their peace is made
With heads and not with hands those whom you curse
Have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound
And lie full low graved in the hollow ground
Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead
Ay all of them at Bristol lost their heads
Where is the duke my father with his power
No matter where of comfort no man speak
Lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
Lets choose executors and talk of wills
And yet not so for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground
Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbrokes
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones
For Gods sake let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings
How some have been deposed some slain in war
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed
Some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd
All murderd for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
To monarchize be feard and kill with looks
Infusing him with self and vain conceit
As if this flesh which walls about our life
Were brass impregnable and humourd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall and farewell king
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence throw away respect
Tradition form and ceremonious duty
For you have but mistook me all this while
I live with bread like you feel want
Taste grief need friends subjected thus
How can you say to me I am a king
My lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes
But presently prevent the ways to wail
To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
And so your follies fight against yourself
Fear and be slain no worse can come to fight
And fight and die is death destroying death
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath
My father hath a power inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb
Thou chidest me well proud Bolingbroke I come
To change blows with thee for our day of doom
This ague fit of fear is overblown
An easy task it is to win our own
Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power
Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
The state and inclination of the day
So may you by my dull and heavy eye
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
I play the torturer by small and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
Your uncle York is joind with Bolingbroke
And all your northern castles yielded up
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party
Thou hast said enough
Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
To DUKE OF AUMERLE
Of that sweet way I was in to despair
What say you now what comfort have we now
By heaven Ill hate him everlastingly
That bids me be of comfort any more
Go to Flint castle there Ill pine away
A king woes slave shall kingly woe obey
That power I have discharge and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow
For I have none let no man speak again
To alter this for counsel is but vain
My liege one word
He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
Discharge my followers let them hence away
From Richards night to Bolingbrokes fair day
Exeunt
Enter with drum and colours HENRY BOLINGBROKE DUKE OF YORK NORTHUMBERLAND Attendants and forces
So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast
The news is very fair and good my lord
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say King Richard alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head
Your grace mistakes only to be brief
Left I his title out
The time hath been
Would you have been so brief with him he would
Have been so brief with you to shorten you
For taking so the head your whole heads length
Mistake not uncle further than you should
Take not good cousin further than you should
Lest you mistake the heavens are oer our heads
I know it uncle and oppose not myself
Against their will But who comes here
Enter HENRY PERCY
Welcome Harry what will not this castle yield
The castle royally is mannd my lord
Against thy entrance
Royally
Why it contains no king
Yes my good lord
It doth contain a king King Richard lies
Within the limits of yon lime and stone
And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury
Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence who I cannot learn
O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle
Noble lords
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruind ears and thus deliver
Henry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Richards hand
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power
Provided that my banishment repeald
And lands restored again be freely granted
If not Ill use the advantage of my power
And lay the summers dust with showers of blood
Raind from the wounds of slaughterd Englishmen
The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
The fresh green lap of fair King Richards land
My stooping duty tenderly shall show
Go signify as much while here we march
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain
Lets march without the noise of threatening drum
That from this castles tatterd battlements
Our fair appointments may be well perused
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no less terror than the elements
Of fire and water when their thundering shock
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
Be he the fire Ill be the yielding water
The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain
My waters on the earth and not on him
March on and mark King Richard how he looks
Parle without and answer within Then a flourish  Enter on the walls KING RICHARD II the BISHOP OF  CARLISLE DUKE OF AUMERLE SIR STEPHEN SCROOP and EARL OF SALISBURY
See see King Richard doth himself appear
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From out the fiery portal of the east
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident
Yet looks he like a king behold his eye
As bright as is the eagles lightens forth
Controlling majesty alack alack for woe
That any harm should stain so fair a show
We are amazed and thus long have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee
To NORTHUMBERLAND
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king
And if we be how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our presence
If we be not show us the hand of God
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship
For well we know no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
Unless he do profane steal or usurp
And though you think that all as you have done
Have torn their souls by turning them from us
And we are barren and bereft of friends
Yet know my master God omnipotent
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot
That lift your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown
Tell Bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
Shall ill become the flower of Englands face
Change the complexion of her maidpale peace
To scarlet indignation and bedew
Her pastures grass with faithful English blood
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rushd upon Thy thrice noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
And by the honourable tomb he swears
That stands upon your royal grandsires bones
And by the royalties of both your bloods
Currents that spring from one most gracious head
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt
And by the worth and honour of himself
Comprising all that may be sworn or said
His coming hither hath no further scope
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees
Which on thy royal party granted once
His glittering arms he will commend to rust
His barbed steeds to stables and his heart
To faithful service of your majesty
This swears he as he is a prince is just
And as I am a gentleman I credit him
Northumberland say thus the king returns
His noble cousin is right welcome hither
And all the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplishd without contradiction
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
We do debase ourselves cousin do we not
To DUKE OF AUMERLE
To look so poorly and to speak so fair
Shall we call back Northumberland and send
Defiance to the traitor and so die
No good my lord lets fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
O God O God that eer this tongue of mine
That laid the sentence of dread banishment
On yon proud man should take it off again
With words of sooth O that I were as great
As is my grief or lesser than my name
Or that I could forget what I have been
Or not remember what I must be now
Swellst thou proud heart Ill give thee scope to beat
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke
What must the king do now must he submit
The king shall do it must he be deposed
The king shall be contented must he lose
The name of king o Gods name let it go
Ill give my jewels for a set of beads
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage
My gay apparel for an almsmans gown
My figured goblets for a dish of wood
My sceptre for a palmers walking staff
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
And my large kingdom for a little grave
A little little grave an obscure grave
Or Ill be buried in the kings highway
Some way of common trade where subjects feet
May hourly trample on their sovereigns head
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live
And buried once why not upon my head
Aumerle thou weepst my tenderhearted cousin
Well make foul weather with despised tears
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
And make a dearth in this revolting land
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes
And make some pretty match with shedding tears
As thus to drop them still upon one place
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth and therein laidthere lies
Two kinsmen diggd their graves with weeping eyes
Would not this ill do well Well well I see
I talk but idly and you laugh at me
Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland
What says King Bolingbroke will his majesty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die
You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay
My lord in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you may it please you to come down
Down down I come like glistering Phaethon
Wanting the manage of unruly jades
In the base court Base court where kings grow base
To come at traitors calls and do them grace
In the base court Come down Down court
down king
For nightowls shriek where mounting larks
should sing
Exeunt from above
What says his majesty
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
Yet he is come
Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below
Stand all apart
And show fair duty to his majesty
He kneels down
My gracious lord
Fair cousin you debase your princely knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy
Up cousin up your heart is up I know
Thus high at least although your knee be low
My gracious lord I come but for mine own
Your own is yours and I am yours and all
So far be mine my most redoubted lord
As my true service shall deserve your love
Well you deserve they well deserve to have
That know the strongst and surest way to get
Uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes
Tears show their love but want their remedies
Cousin I am too young to be your father
Though you are old enough to be my heir
What you will have Ill give and willing too
For do we must what force will have us do
Set on towards London cousin is it so
Yea my good lord
Then I must not say no
Flourish Exeunt
Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies
What sport shall we devise here in this garden
To drive away the heavy thought of care
Madam well play at bowls
Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
And that my fortune rubs against the bias
Madam well dance
My legs can keep no measure in delight
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
Therefore no dancing girl some other sport
Madam well tell tales
Of sorrow or of joy
Of either madam
Of neither girl
For of joy being altogether wanting
It doth remember me the more of sorrow
Or if of grief being altogether had
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy
For what I have I need not to repeat
And what I want it boots not to complain
Madam Ill sing
Tis well that thou hast cause
But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
I could weep madam would it do you good
And I could sing would weeping do me good
And never borrow any tear of thee
Enter a Gardener and two Servants
But stay here come the gardeners
Lets step into the shadow of these trees
My wretchedness unto a row of pins
Theyll talk of state for every one doth so
Against a change woe is forerun with woe
QUEEN and Ladies retire
Go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
Which like unruly children make their sire
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
Give some supportance to the bending twigs
Go thou and like an executioner
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
That look too lofty in our commonwealth
All must be even in our government
You thus employd I will go root away
The noisome weeds which without profit suck
The soils fertility from wholesome flowers
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion
Showing as in a model our firm estate
When our seawalled garden the whole land
Is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up
Her fruittrees all upturned her hedges ruind
Her knots disorderd and her wholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars
Hold thy peace
He that hath sufferd this disorderd spring
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
The weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter
That seemd in eating him to hold him up
Are pluckd up root and all by Bolingbroke
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green
What are they dead
They are and Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful king O what pity is it
That he had not so trimmd and dressd his land
As we this garden We at time of year
Do wound the bark the skin of our fruittrees
Lest being overproud in sap and blood
With too much riches it confound itself
Had he done so to great and growing men
They might have lived to bear and he to taste
Their fruits of duty superfluous branches
We lop away that bearing boughs may live
Had he done so himself had borne the crown
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
What think you then the king shall be deposed
Depressd he is already and deposed
Tis doubt he will be letters came last night
To a dear friend of the good Duke of Yorks
That tell black tidings
O I am pressd to death through want of speaking
Coming forward
Thou old Adams likeness set to dress this garden
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
What Eve what serpent hath suggested thee
To make a second fall of cursed man
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed
Darest thou thou little better thing than earth
Divine his downfall Say where when and how
Camest thou by this ill tidings speak thou wretch
Pardon me madam little joy have I
To breathe this news yet what I say is true
King Richard he is in the mighty hold
Of Bolingbroke their fortunes both are weighd
In your lords scale is nothing but himself
And some few vanities that make him light
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke
Besides himself are all the English peers
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down
Post you to London and you will find it so
I speak no more than every one doth know
Nimble mischance that art so light of foot
Doth not thy embassage belong to me
And am I last that knows it O thou thinkst
To serve me last that I may longest keep
Thy sorrow in my breast Come ladies go
To meet at London Londons king in woe
What was I born to this that my sad look
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke
Gardener for telling me these news of woe
Pray God the plants thou graftst may never grow
Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies
Poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
I would my skill were subject to thy curse
Here did she fall a tear here in this place
Ill set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
In the remembrance of a weeping queen
Exeunt
Enter as to the Parliament HENRY BOLINGBROKE  DUKE OF AUMERLE NORTHUMBERLAND HENRY PERCY LORD  FITZWATER DUKE OF SURREY the BISHOP OF CARLISLE  the Abbot Of Westminster and another Lord Herald Officers and BAGOT
Call forth Bagot
Now Bagot freely speak thy mind
What thou dost know of noble Gloucesters death
Who wrought it with the king and who performd
The bloody office of his timeless end
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle
Cousin stand forth and look upon that man
My Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliverd
In that dead time when Gloucesters death was plotted
I heard you say Is not my arm of length
That reacheth from the restful English court
As far as Calais to mine uncles head
Amongst much other talk that very time
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbrokes return to England
Adding withal how blest this land would be
In this your cousins death
Princes and noble lords
What answer shall I make to this base man
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars
On equal terms to give him chastisement
Either I must or have mine honour soild
With the attainder of his slanderous lips
There is my gage the manual seal of death
That marks thee out for hell I say thou liest
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heartblood though being all too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword
Bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up
Excepting one I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath moved me so
If that thy valour stand on sympathy
There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine
By that fair sun which shows me where thou standst
I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucesters death
If thou denyst it twenty times thou liest
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
Where it was forged with my rapiers point
Thou darest not coward live to see that day
Now by my soul I would it were this hour
Fitzwater thou art damnd to hell for this
Aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
In this appeal as thou art all unjust
And that thou art so there I throw my gage
To prove it on thee to the extremest point
Of mortal breathing seize it if thou darest
An if I do not may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe
I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle
And spur thee on with full as many lies
As may be holload in thy treacherous ear
From sun to sun there is my honours pawn
Engage it to the trial if thou darest
Who sets me else by heaven Ill throw at all
I have a thousand spirits in one breast
To answer twenty thousand such as you
My Lord Fitzwater I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk
Tis very true you were in presence then
And you can witness with me this is true
As false by heaven as heaven itself is true
Surrey thou liest
Dishonourable boy
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
Till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy fathers skull
In proof whereof there is my honours pawn
Engage it to the trial if thou darest
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness
And spit upon him whilst I say he lies
And lies and lies there is my bond of faith
To tie thee to my strong correction
As I intend to thrive in this new world
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
Besides I heard the banishd Norfolk say
That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men
To execute the noble duke at Calais
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies here do I throw down this
If he may be repeald to try his honour
These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeald repeald he shall be
And though mine enemy restored again
To all his lands and signories when hes returnd
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial
That honourable day shall neer be seen
Many a time hath banishd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans Turks and Saracens
And toild with works of war retired himself
To Italy and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant countrys earth
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ
Under whose colours he had fought so long
Why bishop is Norfolk dead
As surely as I live my lord
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham Lords appellants
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your days of trial
Enter DUKE OF YORK attended
Great Duke of Lancaster I come to thee
From plumepluckd Richard who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand
Ascend his throne descending now from him
And long live Henry fourth of that name
In Gods name Ill ascend the regal throne
Marry God forbid
Worst in this royal presence may I speak
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
What subject can give sentence on his king
And who sits here that is not Richards subject
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear
Although apparent guilt be seen in them
And shall the figure of Gods majesty
His captain steward deputyelect
Anointed crowned planted many years
Be judged by subject and inferior breath
And he himself not present O forfend it God
That in a Christian climate souls refined
I speak to subjects and a subject speaks
Stirrd up by God thus boldly for his king
My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king
Is a foul traitor to proud Herefords king
And if you crown him let me prophesy
The blood of English shall manure the ground
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
Disorder horror fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit and this land be calld
The field of Golgotha and dead mens skulls
O if you raise this house against this house
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth
Prevent it resist it let it not be so
Lest child childs children cry against you woe
Well have you argued sir and for your pains
Of capital treason we arrest you here
My Lord of Westminster be it your charge
To keep him safely till his day of trial
May it please you lords to grant the commons suit
Fetch hither Richard that in common view
He may surrender so we shall proceed
Without suspicion
I will be his conduct
Exit
Lords you that here are under our arrest
Procure your sureties for your days of answer
Little are we beholding to your love
And little lookd for at your helping hands
Reenter DUKE OF YORK with KING RICHARD II and Officers bearing the regalia
Alack why am I sent for to a king
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reignd I hardly yet have learnd
To insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission Yet I well remember
The favours of these men were they not mine
Did they not sometime cry all hail to me
So Judas did to Christ but he in twelve
Found truth in all but one I in twelve thousand none
God save the king Will no man say amen
Am I both priest and clerk well then amen
God save the king although I be not he
And yet amen if heaven do think him me
To do what service am I sent for hither
To do that office of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee offer
The resignation of thy state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke
Give me the crown Here cousin seize the crown
Here cousin
On this side my hand and on that side yours
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
That owes two buckets filling one another
The emptier ever dancing in the air
The other down unseen and full of water
That bucket down and full of tears am I
Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
I thought you had been willing to resign
My crown I am but still my griefs are mine
You may my glories and my state depose
But not my griefs still am I king of those
Part of your cares you give me with your crown
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
My care is loss of care by old care done
Your care is gain of care by new care won
The cares I give I have though given away
They tend the crown yet still with me they stay
Are you contented to resign the crown
Ay no no ay for I must nothing be
Therefore no no for I resign to thee
Now mark me how I will undo myself
I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart
With mine own tears I wash away my balm
With mine own hands I give away my crown
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state
With mine own breath release all dutys rites
All pomp and majesty I do forswear
My manors rents revenues I forego
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee
Make me that nothing have with nothing grieved
And thou with all pleased that hast all achieved
Long mayst thou live in Richards seat to sit
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit
God save King Harry unkingd Richard says
And send him many years of sunshine days
What more remains
No more but that you read
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Committed by your person and your followers
Against the state and profit of this land
That by confessing them the souls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposed
Must I do so and must I ravel out
My weavedup folly Gentle Northumberland
If thy offences were upon record
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst
There shouldst thou find one heinous article
Containing the deposing of a king
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath
Markd with a blot damnd in the book of heaven
Nay all of you that stand and look upon
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
Showing an outward pity yet you Pilates
Have here deliverd me to my sour cross
And water cannot wash away your sin
My lord dispatch read oer these articles
Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
But they can see a sort of traitors here
Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself
I find myself a traitor with the rest
For I have given here my souls consent
To undeck the pompous body of a king
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave
Proud majesty a subject state a peasant
My lord
No lord of thine thou haught insulting man
Nor no mans lord I have no name no title
No not that name was given me at the font
But tis usurpd alack the heavy day
That I have worn so many winters out
And know not now what name to call myself
O that I were a mockery king of snow
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke
To melt myself away in waterdrops
Good king great king and yet not greatly good
An if my word be sterling yet in England
Let it command a mirror hither straight
That it may show me what a face I have
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty
Go some of you and fetch a lookingglass
Exit an attendant
Read oer this paper while the glass doth come
Fiend thou tormentst me ere I come to hell
Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland
The commons will not then be satisfied
They shall be satisfied Ill read enough
When I do see the very book indeed
Where all my sins are writ and thats myself
Reenter Attendant with a glass
Give me the glass and therein will I read
No deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck
So many blows upon this face of mine
And made no deeper wounds O flattering glass
Like to my followers in prosperity
Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face
That every day under his household roof
Did keep ten thousand men was this the face
That like the sun did make beholders wink
Was this the face that faced so many follies
And was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke
A brittle glory shineth in this face
As brittle as the glory is the face
Dashes the glass against the ground
For there it is crackd in a hundred shivers
Mark silent king the moral of this sport
How soon my sorrow hath destroyd my face
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyd
The shadow or your face
Say that again
The shadow of my sorrow ha lets see
Tis very true my grief lies all within
And these external manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That swells with silence in the tortured soul
There lies the substance and I thank thee king
For thy great bounty that not only givest
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the cause Ill beg one boon
And then be gone and trouble you no more
Shall I obtain it
Name it fair cousin
Fair cousin I am greater than a king
For when I was a king my flatterers
Were then but subjects being now a subject
I have a king here to my flatterer
Being so great I have no need to beg
Yet ask
And shall I have
You shall
Then give me leave to go
Whither
Whither you will so I were from your sights
Go some of you convey him to the Tower
O good convey conveyers are you all
That rise thus nimbly by a true kings fall
Exeunt KING RICHARD II some Lords and a Guard
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation lords prepare yourselves
Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE the Abbot of Westminster and DUKE OF AUMERLE
A woeful pageant have we here beheld
The woes to come the children yet unborn
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
You holy clergymen is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot
My lord
Before I freely speak my mind herein
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise
I see your brows are full of discontent
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
Come home with me to supper and Ill lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day
Exeunt
Enter QUEEN and Ladies
This way the king will come this is the way
To Julius Caesars illerected tower
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
Is doomd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke
Here let us rest if this rebellious earth
Have any resting for her true kings queen
Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard
But soft but see or rather do not see
My fair rose wither yet look up behold
That you in pity may dissolve to dew
And wash him fresh again with truelove tears
Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand
Thou map of honour thou King Richards tomb
And not King Richard thou most beauteous inn
Why should hardfavourd grief be lodged in thee
When triumph is become an alehouse guest
Join not with grief fair woman do not so
To make my end too sudden learn good soul
To think our former state a happy dream
From which awaked the truth of what we are
Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet
To grim Necessity and he and I
Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house
Our holy lives must win a new worlds crown
Which our profane hours here have stricken down
What is my Richard both in shape and mind
Transformd and weakend hath Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect hath he been in thy heart
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
To be oerpowerd and wilt thou pupillike
Take thy correction mildly kiss the rod
And fawn on rage with base humility
Which art a lion and a king of beasts
A king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
I had been still a happy king of men
Good sometime queen prepare thee hence for France
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest
As from my deathbed thy last living leave
In winters tedious nights sit by the fire
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid
And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
And send the hearers weeping to their beds
For why the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out
And some will mourn in ashes some coalblack
For the deposing of a rightful king
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others
My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changed
You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower
And madam there is order taen for you
With all swift speed you must away to France
Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
Shalt break into corruption thou shalt think
Though he divide the realm and give thee half
It is too little helping him to all
And he shall think that thou which knowst the way
To plant unrightful kings wilt know again
Being neer so little urged another way
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
The love of wicked men converts to fear
That fear to hate and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and deserved death
My guilt be on my head and there an end
Take leave and part for you must part forthwith
Doubly divorced Bad men you violate
A twofold marriage twixt my crown and me
And then betwixt me and my married wife
Let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
And yet not so for with a kiss twas made
Part us Northumberland I toward the north
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp
She came adorned hither like sweet May
Sent back like Hallowmas or shortst of day
And must we be divided must we part
Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
Banish us both and send the king with me
That were some love but little policy
Then whither he goes thither let me go
So two together weeping make one woe
Weep thou for me in France I for thee here
Better far off than near be neer the near
Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans
So longest way shall have the longest moans
Twice for one step Ill groan the way being short
And piece the way out with a heavy heart
Come come in wooing sorrow lets be brief
Since wedding it there is such length in grief
One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart
Give me mine own again twere no good part
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart
So now I have mine own again be gone
That I might strive to kill it with a groan
We make woe wanton with this fond delay
Once more adieu the rest let sorrow say
Exeunt
Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK
My lord you told me you would tell the rest
When weeping made you break the story off
of our two cousins coming into London
Where did I leave
At that sad stop my lord
Where rude misgovernd hands from windows tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head
Then as I said the duke great Bolingbroke
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspiring rider seemd to know
With slow but stately pace kept on his course
Whilst all tongues cried God save thee
Bolingbroke
You would have thought the very windows spake
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
Jesu preserve thee welcome Bolingbroke
Whilst he from the one side to the other turning
Bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck
Bespake them thus I thank you countrymen
And thus still doing thus he passd along
Alack poor Richard where rode he the whilst
As in a theatre the eyes of men
Are idly bent on him that enters next
Thinking his prattle to be tedious
Even so or with much more contempt mens eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard no man cried God save him
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
His face still combating with tears and smiles
The badges of his grief and patience
That had not God for some strong purpose steeld
The hearts of men they must perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have pitied him
But heaven hath a hand in these events
To whose high will we bound our calm contents
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
Whose state and honour I for aye allow
Here comes my son Aumerle
Aumerle that was
But that is lost for being Richards friend
And madam you must call him Rutland now
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the newmade king
Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE
Welcome my son who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring
Madam I know not nor I greatly care not
God knows I had as lief be none as one
Well bear you well in this new spring of time
Lest you be croppd before you come to prime
What news from Oxford hold those justs and triumphs
For aught I know my lord they do
You will be there I know
If God prevent not I purpose so
What seal is that that hangs without thy bosom
Yea lookst thou pale let me see the writing
My lord tis nothing
No matter then who see it
I will be satisfied let me see the writing
I do beseech your grace to pardon me
It is a matter of small consequence
Which for some reasons I would not have seen
Which for some reasons sir I mean to see
I fear I fear
What should you fear
Tis nothing but some bond that he is enterd into
For gay apparel gainst the triumph day
Bound to himself what doth he with a bond
That he is bound to Wife thou art a fool
Boy let me see the writing
I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it
I will be satisfied let me see it I say
He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it
Treason foul treason Villain traitor slave
What is the matter my lord
Ho who is within there
Enter a Servant
Saddle my horse
God for his mercy what treachery is here
Why what is it my lord
Give me my boots I say saddle my horse
Now by mine honour by my life by my troth
I will appeach the villain
What is the matter
Peace foolish woman
I will not peace What is the matter Aumerle
Good mother be content it is no more
Than my poor life must answer
Thy life answer
Bring me my boots I will unto the king
Reenter Servant with boots
Strike him Aumerle Poor boy thou art amazed
Hence villain never more come in my sight
Give me my boots I say
Why York what wilt thou do
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
Have we more sons or are we like to have
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
And rob me of a happy mothers name
Is he not like thee is he not thine own
Thou fond mad woman
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
A dozen of them here have taen the sacrament
And interchangeably set down their hands
To kill the king at Oxford
He shall be none
Well keep him here then what is that to him
Away fond woman were he twenty times my son
I would appeach him
Hadst thou groand for him
As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed
And that he is a bastard not thy son
Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind
He is as like thee as a man may be
Not like to me or any of my kin
And yet I love him
Make way unruly woman
Exit
After Aumerle mount thee upon his horse
Spur post and get before him to the king
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
Ill not be long behind though I be old
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York
And never will I rise up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke have pardond thee Away be gone
Exeunt
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE HENRY PERCY and other Lords
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
Tis full three months since I did see him last
If any plague hang over us tis he
I would to God my lords he might be found
Inquire at London mongst the taverns there
For there they say he daily doth frequent
With unrestrained loose companions
Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
And beat our watch and rob our passengers
Which he young wanton and effeminate boy
Takes on the point of honour to support
So dissolute a crew
My lord some two days since I saw the prince
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford
And what said the gallant
His answer was he would unto the stews
And from the commonst creature pluck a glove
And wear it as a favour and with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger
As dissolute as desperate yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope which elder years
May happily bring forth But who comes here
Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE
Where is the king
What means our cousin that he stares and looks
So wildly
God save your grace I do beseech your majesty
To have some conference with your grace alone
Withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
Exeunt HENRY PERCY and Lords
What is the matter with our cousin now
For ever may my knees grow to the earth
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak
Intended or committed was this fault
If on the first how heinous eer it be
To win thy afterlove I pardon thee
Then give me leave that I may turn the key
That no man enter till my tale be done
Have thy desire
Within  My liege beware look to thyself
Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there
Villain Ill make thee safe
Drawing
Stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear
Within  Open the door secure foolhardy king
Shall I for love speak treason to thy face
Open the door or I will break it open
Enter DUKE OF YORK
What is the matter uncle speak
Recover breath tell us how near is danger
That we may arm us to encounter it
Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
The treason that my haste forbids me show
Remember as thou readst thy promise passd
I do repent me read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand
It was villain ere thy hand did set it down
I tore it from the traitors bosom king
Fear and not love begets his penitence
Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart
O heinous strong and bold conspiracy
O loyal father of a treacherous son
Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself
Thy overflow of good converts to bad
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
This deadly blot in thy digressing son
So shall my virtue be his vices bawd
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies
Thou killst me in his life giving him breath
The traitor lives the true mans put to death
Within  What ho my liege for Gods sake
let me in
What shrillvoiced suppliant makes this eager cry
A woman and thy aunt great king tis I
Speak with me pity me open the door
A beggar begs that never beggd before
And now changed to The Beggar and the King
My dangerous cousin let your mother in
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin
If thou do pardon whosoever pray
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may
This festerd joint cut off the rest rest sound
This let alone will all the rest confound
Enter DUCHESS OF YORK
O king believe not this hardhearted man
Love loving not itself none other can
Thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
Sweet York be patient Hear me gentle liege
Kneels
Rise up good aunt
Not yet I thee beseech
For ever will I walk upon my knees
And never see day that the happy sees
Till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
By pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy
Unto my mothers prayers I bend my knee
Against them both my true joints bended be
Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
Pleads he in earnest look upon his face
His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
His words come from his mouth ours from our breast
He prays but faintly and would be denied
We pray with heart and soul and all beside
His weary joints would gladly rise I know
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity
Our prayers do outpray his then let them have
That mercy which true prayer ought to have
Good aunt stand up
Nay do not say stand up
Say pardon first and afterwards stand up
And if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
Pardon should be the first word of thy speech
I never longd to hear a word till now
Say pardon king let pity teach thee how
The word is short but not so short as sweet
No word like pardon for kings mouths so meet
Speak it in French king say pardonne moi
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
Ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord
That setst the word itself against the word
Speak pardon as tis current in our land
The chopping French we do not understand
Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
Pity may move thee pardon to rehearse
Good aunt stand up
I do not sue to stand
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand
I pardon him as God shall pardon me
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee
Yet am I sick for fear speak it again
Twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain
But makes one pardon strong
With all my heart
I pardon him
A god on earth thou art
But for our trusty brotherinlaw and the abbot
With all the rest of that consorted crew
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
Good uncle help to order several powers
To Oxford or whereer these traitors are
They shall not live within this world I swear
But I will have them if I once know where
Uncle farewell and cousin too adieu
Your mother well hath prayd and prove you true
Come my old son I pray God make thee new
Exeunt
Enter EXTON and Servant
Didst thou not mark the king what words he spake
Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear
Was it not so
These were his very words
Have I no friend quoth he he spake it twice
And urged it twice together did he not
He did
And speaking it he wistly lookd on me
And who should say I would thou wert the man
That would divorce this terror from my heart
Meaning the king at Pomfret Come lets go
I am the kings friend and will rid his foe
Exeunt
Enter KING RICHARD
I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world
And for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself
I cannot do it yet Ill hammer it out
My brain Ill prove the female to my soul
My soul the father and these two beget
A generation of stillbreeding thoughts
And these same thoughts people this little world
In humours like the people of this world
For no thought is contented The better sort
As thoughts of things divine are intermixd
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word
As thus Come little ones and then again
It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the postern of a small needles eye
Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world my ragged prison walls
And for they cannot die in their own pride
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
That they are not the first of fortunes slaves
Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
That many have and others must sit there
And in this thought they find a kind of ease
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Of such as have before endured the like
Thus play I in one person many people
And none contented sometimes am I king
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
And so I am then crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king
Then am I kingd again and by and by
Think that I am unkingd by Bolingbroke
And straight am nothing but whateer I be
Nor I nor any man that but man is
With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
With being nothing Music do I hear
Music
Ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is
When time is broke and no proportion kept
So is it in the music of mens lives
And here have I the daintiness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorderd string
But for the concord of my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke
I wasted time and now doth time waste me
For now hath time made me his numbering clock
My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
Whereto my finger like a dials point
Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
Which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes times and hours but my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy
While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock
This music mads me let it sound no more
For though it have holp madmen to their wits
In me it seems it will make wise men mad
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
For tis a sign of love and love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this allhating world
Enter a Groom of the Stable
Hail royal prince
Thanks noble peer
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
What art thou and how comest thou hither
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
That brings me food to make misfortune live
I was a poor groom of thy stable king
When thou wert king who travelling towards York
With much ado at length have gotten leave
To look upon my sometimes royal masters face
O how it yearnd my heart when I beheld
In London streets that coronationday
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid
That horse that I so carefully have dressd
Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend
How went he under him
So proudly as if he disdaind the ground
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him
Would he not stumble would he not fall down
Since pride must have a fall and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back
Forgiveness horse why do I rail on thee
Since thou created to be awed by man
Wast born to bear I was not made a horse
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass
Spurrd galld and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke
Enter Keeper with a dish
Fellow give place here is no longer stay
If thou love me tis time thou wert away
What my tongue dares not that my heart shall say
Exit
My lord willt please you to fall to
Taste of it first as thou art wont to do
My lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton who
lately came from the king commands the contrary
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee
Patience is stale and I am weary of it
Beats the keeper
Help help help
Enter EXTON and Servants armed
How now what means death in this rude assault
Villain thy own hand yields thy deaths instrument
Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him
Go thou and fill another room in hell
He kills another Then Exton strikes him down
That hand shall burn in neverquenching fire
That staggers thus my person Exton thy fierce hand
Hath with the kings blood staind the kings own land
Mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
Dies
As full of valour as of royal blood
Both have I spilld O would the deed were good
For now the devil that told me I did well
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell
This dead king to the living king Ill bear
Take hence the rest and give them burial here
Exeunt
Flourish Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE DUKE OF YORK with other Lords and Attendants
Kind uncle York the latest news we hear
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire
But whether they be taen or slain we hear not
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
Welcome my lordwhat is the news
First to thy sacred state wish I all happiness
The next news is I have to London sent
The heads of Oxford Salisbury Blunt and Kent
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here
We thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains
Enter LORD FITZWATER
My lord I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow
Thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot
Right noble is thy merit well I wot
Enter HENRY PERCY and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE
The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
Hath yielded up his body to the grave
But here is Carlisle living to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride
Carlisle this is your doom
Choose out some secret place some reverend room
More than thou hast and with it joy thy life
So as thou livest in peace die free from strife
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen
Enter EXTON with persons bearing a coffin
Great king within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies
Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought
Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land
From your own mouth my lord did I this deed
They love not poison that do poison need
Nor do I thee though I did wish him dead
I hate the murderer love him murdered
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
But neither my good word nor princely favour
With Cain go wander through shades of night
And never show thy head by day nor light
Lords I protest my soul is full of woe
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
Come mourn with me for that I do lament
And put on sullen black incontinent
Ill make a voyage to the Holy Land
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand
March sadly after grace my mournings here
In weeping after this untimely bier
Exeunt
Enter GLOUCESTER solus
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that lourd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
Grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
And now instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
I that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph
I that am curtaild of this fair proportion
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature
Deformed unfinishd sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them
Why I in this weak piping time of peace
Have no delight to pass away the time
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity
And therefore since I cannot prove a lover
To entertain these fair wellspoken days
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days
Plots have I laid inductions dangerous
By drunken prophecies libels and dreams
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle false and treacherous
This day should Clarence closely be mewd up
About a prophecy which says that G
Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be
Dive thoughts down to my soul here
Clarence comes
Enter CLARENCE guarded and BRAKENBURY
Brother good day what means this armed guard
That waits upon your grace
His majesty
Tendering my persons safety hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower
Upon what cause
Because my name is George
Alack my lord that fault is none of yours
He should for that commit your godfathers
O belike his majesty hath some intent
That you shall be newchristend in the Tower
But whats the matter Clarence  may I know
Yea Richard when I know for I protest
As yet I do not but as I can learn
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams
And from the crossrow plucks the letter G
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be
And for my name of George begins with G
It follows in his thought that I am he
These as I learn and such like toys as these
Have moved his highness to commit me now
Why this it is when men are ruled by women
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower
My Lady Grey his wife Clarence tis she
That tempers him to this extremity
Was it not she and that good man of worship
Anthony Woodville her brother there
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower
From whence this present day he is deliverd
We are not safe Clarence we are not safe
By heaven I think theres no man is secure
But the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty
Ill tell you what I think it is our way
If we will keep in favour with the king
To be her men and wear her livery
The jealous oerworn widow and herself
Since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy
I beseech your graces both to pardon me
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference
Of what degree soever with his brother
Even so ant please your worship Brakenbury
You may partake of any thing we say
We speak no treason man we say the king
Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
Well struck in years fair and not jealous
We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot
A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
And that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks
How say you sir Can you deny all this
With this my lord myself have nought to do
Naught to do with mistress Shore I tell thee fellow
He that doth naught with her excepting one
Were best he do it secretly alone
What one my lord
Her husband knave wouldst thou betray me
I beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke
We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey
We are the queens abjects and must obey
Brother farewell I will unto the king
And whatsoever you will employ me in
Were it to call King Edwards widow sister
I will perform it to enfranchise you
Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine
I know it pleaseth neither of us well
Well your imprisonment shall not be long
Meantime have patience
I must perforce Farewell
Exeunt CLARENCE BRAKENBURY and Guard
Go tread the path that thou shalt neer return
Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven
If heaven will take the present at our hands
But who comes here the newdeliverd Hastings
Enter HASTINGS
Good time of day unto my gracious lord
As much unto my good lord chamberlain
Well are you welcome to the open air
How hath your lordship brookd imprisonment
With patience noble lord as prisoners must
But I shall live my lord to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment
No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too
For they that were your enemies are his
And have prevaild as much on him as you
More pity that the eagle should be mewd
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty
What news abroad
No news so bad abroad as this at home
The King is sickly weak and melancholy
And his physicians fear him mightily
Now by Saint Paul this news is bad indeed
O he hath kept an evil diet long
And overmuch consumed his royal person
Tis very grievous to be thought upon
What is he in his bed
He is
Go you before and I will follow you
Exit HASTINGS
He cannot live I hope and must not die
Till George be packd with posthorse up to heaven
Ill in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
With lies well steeld with weighty arguments
And if I fall not in my deep intent
Clarence hath not another day to live
Which done God take King Edward to his mercy
And leave the world for me to bustle in
For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter
What though I killd her husband and her father
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father
The which will I not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent
By marrying her which I must reach unto
But yet I run before my horse to market
Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns
When they are gone then must I count my gains
Exit
Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth Gentlemen with halberds to guard it LADY ANNE being the mourner
Set down set down your honourable load
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster
Poor keycold figure of a holy king
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne
Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughterd son
Stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
Lo in these windows that let forth thy life
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
More direful hap betide that hated wretch
That makes us wretched by the death of thee
Than I can wish to adders spiders toads
Or any creeping venomd thing that lives
If ever he have child abortive be it
Prodigious and untimely brought to light
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view
And that be heir to his unhappiness
If ever he have wife let her he made
A miserable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee
Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load
Taken from Pauls to be interred there
And still as you are weary of the weight
Rest you whiles I lament King Henrys corse
Enter GLOUCESTER
Stay you that bear the corse and set it down
What black magician conjures up this fiend
To stop devoted charitable deeds
Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul
Ill make a corse of him that disobeys
My lord stand back and let the coffin pass
Unmannerd dog stand thou when I command
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast
Or by Saint Paul Ill strike thee to my foot
And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
What do you tremble are you all afraid
Alas I blame you not for you are mortal
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body
His soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
Sweet saint for charity be not so curst
Foul devil for Gods sake hence and trouble us not
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
Filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries
O gentlemen see see dead Henrys wounds
Open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh
Blush Blush thou lump of foul deformity
For tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
Thy deed inhuman and unnatural
Provokes this deluge most unnatural
O God which this blood madest revenge his death
O earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death
Either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead
Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
As thou dost swallow up this good kings blood
Which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered
Lady you know no rules of charity
Which renders good for bad blessings for curses
Villain thou knowst no law of God nor man
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
But I know none and therefore am no beast
O wonderful when devils tell the truth
More wonderful when angels are so angry
Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
Of these supposedevils to give me leave
By circumstance but to acquit myself
Vouchsafe defused infection of a man
For these known evils but to give me leave
By circumstance to curse thy cursed self
Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself
Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
No excuse current but to hang thyself
By such despair I should accuse myself
And by despairing shouldst thou stand excused
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others
Say that I slew them not
Why then they are not dead
But dead they are and devilish slave by thee
I did not kill your husband
Why then he is alive
Nay he is dead and slain by Edwards hand
In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
The which thou once didst bend against her breast
But that thy brothers beat aside the point
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries
Didst thou not kill this king
I grant ye
Dost grant me hedgehog then God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
O he was gentle mild and virtuous
The fitter for the King of heaven that hath him
He is in heaven where thou shalt never come
Let him thank me that holp to send him thither
For he was fitter for that place than earth
And thou unfit for any place but hell
Yes one place else if you will hear me name it
Some dungeon
Your bedchamber
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
So will it madam till I lie with you
I hope so
I know so But gentle Lady Anne
To leave this keen encounter of our wits
And fall somewhat into a slower method
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward
As blameful as the executioner
Thou art the cause and most accursed effect
Your beauty was the cause of that effect
Your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom
If I thought that I tell thee homicide
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
These eyes could never endure sweet beautys wreck
You should not blemish it if I stood by
As all the world is cheered by the sun
So I by that it is my day my life
Black night oershade thy day and death thy life
Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
I would I were to be revenged on thee
It is a quarrel most unnatural
To be revenged on him that loveth you
It is a quarrel just and reasonable
To be revenged on him that slew my husband
He that bereft thee lady of thy husband
Did it to help thee to a better husband
His better doth not breathe upon the earth
He lives that loves thee better than he could
Name him
Plantagenet
Why that was he
The selfsame name but one of better nature
Where is he
Here
She spitteth at him
Why dost thou spit at me
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake
Never came poison from so sweet a place
Never hung poison on a fouler toad
Out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes
Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
I would they were that I might die at once
For now they kill me with a living death
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear
No when my father York and Edward wept
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When blackfaced Clifford shook his sword at him
Nor when thy warlike father like a child
Told the sad story of my fathers death
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
That all the standersby had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedashd with rain in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
I never sued to friend nor enemy
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee
My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
She looks scornfully at him
Teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made
For kissing lady not for such contempt
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
Lo here I lend thee this sharppointed sword
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke
And humbly beg the death upon my knee
He lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword
Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry
But twas thy beauty that provoked me
Nay now dispatch twas I that stabbd young Edward
But twas thy heavenly face that set me on
Here she lets fall the sword
Take up the sword again or take up me
Arise dissembler though I wish thy death
I will not be the executioner
Then bid me kill myself and I will do it
I have already
Tush that was in thy rage
Speak it again and even with the word
That hand which for thy love did kill thy love
Shall for thy love kill a far truer love
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary
I would I knew thy heart
Tis figured in my tongue
I fear me both are false
Then never man was true
Well well put up your sword
Say then my peace is made
That shall you know hereafter
But shall I live in hope
All men I hope live so
Vouchsafe to wear this ring
To take is not to give
Look how this ring encompasseth finger
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
Wear both of them for both of them are thine
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
What is it
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner
And presently repair to Crosby Place
Where after I have solemnly interrd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king
And wet his grave with my repentant tears
I will with all expedient duty see you
For divers unknown reasons I beseech you
Grant me this boon
With all my heart and much it joys me too
To see you are become so penitent
Tressel and Berkeley go along with me
Bid me farewell
Tis more than you deserve
But since you teach me how to flatter you
Imagine I have said farewell already
Exeunt LADY ANNE TRESSEL and BERKELEY
Sirs take up the corse
Towards Chertsey noble lord
No to WhiteFriars there attend my coining
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Was ever woman in this humour wood
Was ever woman in this humour won
Ill have her but I will not keep her long
What I that killd her husband and his father
To take her in her hearts extremest hate
With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
The bleeding witness of her hatred by
Having God her conscience and these bars
against me
And I nothing to back my suit at all
But the plain devil and dissembling looks
And yet to win her all the world to nothing
Ha
Hath she forgot already that brave prince
Edward her lord whom I some three months since
Stabbd in my angry mood at Tewksbury
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
Framed in the prodigality of nature
Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me
That croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince
And made her widow to a woful bed
On me whose all not equals Edwards moiety
On me that halt and am unshapen thus
My dukedom to a beggarly denier
I do mistake my person all this while
Upon my life she finds although I cannot
Myself to be a marvellous proper man
Ill be at charges for a lookingglass
And entertain some score or two of tailors
To study fashions to adorn my body
Since I am crept in favour with myself
Will maintain it with some little cost
But first Ill turn yon fellow in his grave
And then return lamenting to my love
Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass
That I may see my shadow as I pass
Exit
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH RIVERS and GREY
Have patience madam theres no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustomd health
In that you brook it in it makes him worse
Therefore for Gods sake entertain good comfort
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words
If he were dead what would betide of me
No other harm but loss of such a lord
The loss of such a lord includes all harm
The heavens have blessd you with a goodly son
To be your comforter when he is gone
Oh he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester
A man that loves not me nor none of you
Is it concluded that he shall be protector
It is determined not concluded yet
But so it must be if the king miscarry
Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby
Good time of day unto your royal grace
God make your majesty joyful as you have been
The Countess Richmond good my Lord of Derby
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen
Yet Derby notwithstanding shes your wife
And loves not me be you good lord assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance
I do beseech you either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers
Or if she be accused in true report
Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds
From wayward sickness and no grounded malice
Saw you the king today my Lord of Derby
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty
What likelihood of his amendment lords
Madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully
God grant him health Did you confer with him
Madam we did he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain
And sent to warn them to his royal presence
Would all were well but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest
Enter GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and DORSET
They do me wrong and I will not endure it
Who are they that complain unto the king
That I forsooth am stern and love them not
By holy Paul they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair
Smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy
I must be held a rancorous enemy
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken sly insinuating Jacks
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace
To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
When have I injured thee when done thee wrong
A plague upon you all His royal person
Whom God preserve better than you would wish
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints
Brother of Gloucester you mistake the matter
The king of his own royal disposition
And not provoked by any suitor else
Aiming belike at your interior hatred
Against my kindred brothers and myself
Makes him to send that thereby he may gather
The ground of your illwill and so remove it
I cannot tell the world is grown so bad
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
Since every Jack became a gentleman
Theres many a gentle person made a Jack
Come come we know your meaning brother
Gloucester
You envy my advancement and my friends
God grant we never may have need of you
Meantime God grants that we have need of you
Your brother is imprisond by your means
Myself disgraced and the nobility
Held in contempt whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce some two days since were worth a noble
By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoyd
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him
My lord you do me shameful injury
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings late imprisonment
She may my lord for
She may Lord Rivers why who knows not so
She may do more sir than denying that
She may help you to many fair preferments
And then deny her aiding hand therein
And lay those honours on your high deserts
What may she not She may yea marry may she
What marry may she
What marry may she marry with a king
A bachelor a handsome stripling too
I wis your grandam had a worser match
My Lord of Gloucester I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
By heaven I will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured
I had rather be a country servantmaid
Than a great queen with this condition
To be thus taunted scornd and baited at
Enter QUEEN MARGARET behind
Small joy have I in being Englands queen
And lessend be that small God I beseech thee
Thy honour state and seat is due to me
What threat you me with telling of the king
Tell him and spare not look what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower
Tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
Out devil I remember them too well
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower
And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury
Ere you were queen yea or your husband king
I was a packhorse in his great affairs
A weederout of his proud adversaries
A liberal rewarder of his friends
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own
Yea and much better blood than his or thine
In all which time you and your husband Grey
And Rivers so were you Was not your husband
In Margarets battle at Saint Albans slain
Let me put in your minds if you forget
What you have been ere now and what you are
Withal what I have been and what I am
A murderous villain and so still thou art
Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick
Yea and forswore himselfwhich Jesu pardon
Which God revenge
To fight on Edwards party for the crown
And for his meed poor lord he is mewd up
I would to God my heart were flint like Edwards
Or Edwards soft and pitiful like mine
I am too childishfoolish for this world
Hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world
Thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
My Lord of Gloucester in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies
We followd then our lord our lawful king
So should we you if you should be our king
If I should be I had rather be a pedlar
Far be it from my heart the thought of it
As little joy my lord as you suppose
You should enjoy were you this countrys king
As little joy may you suppose in me
That I enjoy being the queen thereof
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof
For I am she and altogether joyless
I can no longer hold me patient
Advancing
Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
In sharing that which you have pilld from me
Which of you trembles not that looks on me
If not that I being queen you bow like subjects
Yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels
O gentle villain do not turn away
Foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight
But repetition of what thou hast marrd
That will I make before I let thee go
Wert thou not banished on pain of death
I was but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode
A husband and a son thou owest to me
And thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
The sorrow that I have by right is yours
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine
The curse my noble father laid on thee
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes
And then to dry them gavest the duke a clout
Steepd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland
His curses then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee are all falln upon thee
And God not we hath plagued thy bloody deed
So just is God to right the innocent
O twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
And the most merciless that eer was heard of
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
No man but prophesied revenge for it
Northumberland then present wept to see it
What were you snarling all before I came
Ready to catch each other by the throat
And turn you all your hatred now on me
Did Yorks dread curse prevail so much with heaven
That Henrys death my lovely Edwards death
Their kingdoms loss my woful banishment
Could all but answer for that peevish brat
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
Why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
If not by war by surfeit die your king
As ours by murder to make him a king
Edward thy son which now is Prince of Wales
For Edward my son which was Prince of Wales
Die in his youth by like untimely violence
Thyself a queen for me that was a queen
Outlive thy glory like my wretched self
Long mayst thou live to wail thy childrens loss
And see another as I see thee now
Deckd in thy rights as thou art stalld in mine
Long die thy happy days before thy death
And after many lengthend hours of grief
Die neither mother wife nor Englands queen
Rivers and Dorset you were standers by
And so wast thou Lord Hastings when my son
Was stabbd with bloody daggers God I pray him
That none of you may live your natural age
But by some unlookd accident cut off
Have done thy charm thou hateful witherd hag
And leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee
O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee the troubler of the poor worlds peace
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
Thou elvishmarkd abortive rooting hog
Thou that wast seald in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell
Thou slander of thy mothers heavy womb
Thou loathed issue of thy fathers loins
Thou rag of honour thou detested
Margaret
Richard
Ha
I call thee not
I cry thee mercy then for I had thought
That thou hadst calld me all these bitter names
Why so I did but lookd for no reply
O let me make the period to my curse
Tis done by me and ends in Margaret
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
Poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
Why strewst thou sugar on that bottled spider
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
Fool fool thou whetst a knife to kill thyself
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchbackd toad
Falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience
Foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
Were you well served you would be taught your duty
To serve me well you all should do me duty
Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
Dispute not with her she is lunatic
Peace master marquess you are malapert
Your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
O that your young nobility could judge
What twere to lose it and be miserable
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them
And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
Good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess
It toucheth you my lord as much as me
Yea and much more but I was born so high
Our aery buildeth in the cedars top
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
And turns the sun to shade alas alas
Witness my son now in the shade of death
Whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up
Your aery buildeth in our aerys nest
O God that seest it do not suffer it
As it was won with blood lost be it so
Have done for shame if not for charity
Urge neither charity nor shame to me
Uncharitably with me have you dealt
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcherd
My charity is outrage life my shame
And in that shame still live my sorrows rage
Have done have done
O princely Buckingham Ill kiss thy hand
In sign of league and amity with thee
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood
Nor thou within the compass of my curse
Nor no one here for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air
Ill not believe but they ascend the sky
And there awake Gods gentlesleeping peace
O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog
Look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
His venom tooth will rankle to the death
Have not to do with him beware of him
Sin death and hell have set their marks on him
And all their ministers attend on him
What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham
Nothing that I respect my gracious lord
What dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from
O but remember this another day
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess
Live each of you the subjects to his hate
And he to yours and all of you to Gods
Exit
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses
And so doth mine I muse why shes at liberty
I cannot blame her by Gods holy mother
She hath had too much wrong and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her
I never did her any to my knowledge
But you have all the vantage of her wrong
I was too hot to do somebody good
That is too cold in thinking of it now
Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid
He is frankd up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause of it
A virtuous and a Christianlike conclusion
To pray for them that have done scathe to us
So do I ever
Aside
being welladvised
For had I cursed now I had cursed myself
Enter CATESBY
Madam his majesty doth call for you
And for your grace and you my noble lords
Catesby we come Lords will you go with us
Madam we will attend your grace
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others
Clarence whom I indeed have laid in darkness
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely to Hastings Derby Buckingham
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother
Now they believe it and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers Vaughan Grey
But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ
And seem a saint when most I play the devil
Enter two Murderers
But soft here come my executioners
How now my hardy stout resolved mates
Are you now going to dispatch this deed
We are my lord and come to have the warrant
That we may be admitted where he is
Well thought upon I have it here about me
Gives the warrant
When you have done repair to Crosby Place
But sirs be sudden in the execution
Withal obdurate do not hear him plead
For Clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him
Tush
Fear not my lord we will not stand to prate
Talkers are no good doers be assured
We come to use our hands and not our tongues
Your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears
I like you lads about your business straight
Go go dispatch
We will my noble lord
Exeunt
Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY
Why looks your grace so heavily today
O I have passd a miserable night
So full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams
That as I am a Christian faithful man
I would not spend another such a night
Though twere to buy a world of happy days
So full of dismal terror was the time
What was your dream I long to hear you tell it
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
And was embarkd to cross to Burgundy
And in my company my brother Gloucester
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches thence we looked toward England
And cited up a thousand fearful times
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befalln us As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches
Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling
Struck me that thought to stay him overboard
Into the tumbling billows of the main
Lord Lord methought what pain it was to drown
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks
Ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon
Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
Inestimable stones unvalued jewels
All scatterd in the bottom of the sea
Some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
As twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
Which wood the slimy bottom of the deep
And mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep
Methought I had and often did I strive
To yield the ghost but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul and would not let it forth
To seek the empty vast and wandering air
But smotherd it within my panting bulk
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea
Awaked you not with this sore agony
O no my dream was lengthend after life
O then began the tempest to my soul
Who passd methought the melancholy flood
With that grim ferryman which poets write of
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night
The first that there did greet my stranger soul
Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick
Who cried aloud What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence
And so he vanishd then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel with bright hair
Dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud
Clarence is come false fleeting perjured Clarence
That stabbd me in the field by Tewksbury
Seize on him Furies take him to your torments
With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
Environd me about and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries that with the very noise
I trembling waked and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell
Such terrible impression made the dream
No marvel my lord though it affrighted you
I promise I am afraid to hear you tell it
O Brakenbury I have done those things
Which now bear evidence against my soul
For Edwards sake and see how he requites me
O God if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
I pray thee gentle keeper stay by me
My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep
I will my lord God give your grace good rest
CLARENCE sleeps
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
Makes the night morning and the noontide night
Princes have but their tides for their glories
An outward honour for an inward toil
And for unfelt imagination
They often feel a world of restless cares
So that betwixt their tides and low names
Theres nothing differs but the outward fame
Enter the two Murderers
Ho whos here
In Gods name what are you and how came you hither
I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs
Yea are you so brief
O sir it is better to be brief than tedious Show
him our commission talk no more
BRAKENBURY reads it
I am in this commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands
I will not reason what is meant hereby
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning
Here are the keys there sits the duke asleep
Ill to the king and signify to him
That thus I have resignd my charge to you
Do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well
Exit BRAKENBURY
What shall we stab him as he sleeps
No then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes
When he wakes why fool he shall never wake till
the judgmentday
Why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping
The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind
of remorse in me
What art thou afraid
Not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be
damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us
I thought thou hadst been resolute
So I am to let him live
Back to the Duke of Gloucester tell him so
I pray thee stay a while I hope my holy humour
will change twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty
How dost thou feel thyself now
Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me
Remember our reward when the deed is done
Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward
Where is thy conscience now
In the Duke of Gloucesters purse
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward
thy conscience flies out
Let it go theres few or none will entertain it
How if it come to thee again
Ill not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it
makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it
accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him
he cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it
detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of
obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found it beggars any man that keeps it it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it
Zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me
not to kill the duke
Take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh
Tut I am strongframed he cannot prevail with me
I warrant thee
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation Come shall we to this gear
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt
in the next room
O excellent devise make a sop of him
Hark he stirs shall I strike
No first lets reason with him
Where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine
You shall have wine enough my lord anon
In Gods name what art thou
A man as you are
But not as I am royal
Nor you as we are loyal
Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
My voice is now the kings my looks mine own
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
Your eyes do menace me why look you pale
Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come
To to to
To murder me
Ay ay
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
Wherein my friends have I offended you
Offended us you have not but the king
I shall be reconciled to him again
Never my lord therefore prepare to die
Are you calld forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent What is my offence
Where are the evidence that do accuse me
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death
Before I be convict by course of law
To threaten me with death is most unlawful
I charge you as you hope to have redemption
By Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable
What we will do we do upon command
And he that hath commanded is the king
Erroneous vassal the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans
Take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands
To hurl upon their heads that break his law
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
For false forswearing and for murder too
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster
And like a traitor to the name of God
Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
Unripdst the bowels of thy sovereigns son
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend
How canst thou urge Gods dreadful law to us
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree
Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed
For Edward for my brother for his sake Why sirs
He sends ye not to murder me for this
For in this sin he is as deep as I
If God will be revenged for this deed
O know you yet he doth it publicly
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him
Who made thee then a bloody minister
When gallantspringing brave Plantagenet
That princely novice was struck dead by thee
My brothers love the devil and my rage
Thy brothers love our duty and thy fault
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
Oh if you love my brother hate not me
I am his brother and I love him well
If you be hired for meed go back again
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death
You are deceived your brother Gloucester hates you
O no he loves me and he holds me dear
Go you to him from me
Ay so we will
Tell him when that our princely father York
Blessd his three sons with his victorious arm
And charged us from his soul to love each other
He little thought of this divided friendship
Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep
Ay millstones as be lessond us to weep
O do not slander him for he is kind
Right
As snow in harvest Thou deceivest thyself
Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee
It cannot be for when I parted with him
He huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs
That he would labour my delivery
Why so he doth now he delivers thee
From this worlds thraldom to the joys of heaven
Make peace with God for you must die my lord
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
To counsel me to make my peace with God
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me
Ah sirs consider he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed
What shall we do
Relent and save your souls
Relent tis cowardly and womanish
Not to relent is beastly savage devilish
Which of you if you were a princes son
Being pent from liberty as I am now
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you
Would not entreat for life
My friend I spy some pity in thy looks
O if thine eye be not a flatterer
Come thou on my side and entreat for me
As you would beg were you in my distress
A begging prince what beggar pities not
Look behind you my lord
Take that and that if all this will not do
Stabs him
Ill drown you in the malmseybutt within
Exit with the body
A bloody deed and desperately dispatchd
How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous guilty murder done
Reenter First Murderer
How now what meanst thou that thou helpst me not
By heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art
I would he knew that I had saved his brother
Take thou the fee and tell him what I say
For I repent me that the duke is slain
Exit
So do not I go coward as thou art
Now must I hide his body in some hole
Until the duke take order for his burial
And when I have my meed I must away
For this will out and here I must not stay
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV sick QUEEN  ELIZABETH DORSET RIVERS HASTINGS BUCKINGHAM GREY and others
Why so now have I done a good days work
You peers continue this united league
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth
Rivers and Hastings take each others hand
Dissemble not your hatred swear your love
By heaven my heart is purged from grudging hate
And with my hand I seal my true hearts love
So thrive I as I truly swear the like
Take heed you dally not before your king
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood and award
Either of you to be the others end
So prosper I as I swear perfect love
And I as I love Hastings with my heart
Madam yourself are not exempt in this
Nor your son Dorset Buckingham nor you
Wife love Lord Hastings let him kiss your hand
And what you do do it unfeignedly
Here Hastings I will never more remember
Our former hatred so thrive I and mine
Dorset embrace him Hastings love lord marquess
This interchange of love I here protest
Upon my part shall be unviolable
And so swear I my lord
They embrace
Now princely Buckingham seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wifes allies
And make me happy in your unity
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours
To the Queen
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love
When I have most need to employ a friend
And most assured that he is a friend
Deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
Be he unto me this do I beg of God
When I am cold in zeal to yours
A pleasing cordial princely Buckingham
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
To make the perfect period of this peace
And in good time here comes the noble duke
Enter GLOUCESTER
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
And princely peers a happy time of day
Happy indeed as we have spent the day
Brother we done deeds of charity
Made peace enmity fair love of hate
Between these swelling wrongincensed peers
A blessed labour my most sovereign liege
Amongst this princely heap if any here
By false intelligence or wrong surmise
Hold me a foe
If I unwittingly or in my rage
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
By any in this presence I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace
Tis death to me to be at enmity
I hate it and desire all good mens love
First madam I entreat true peace of you
Which I will purchase with my duteous service
Of you my noble cousin Buckingham
If ever any grudge were lodged between us
Of you Lord Rivers and Lord Grey of you
That without desert have frownd on me
Dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born tonight
I thank my God for my humility
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter
I would to God all strifes were well compounded
My sovereign liege I do beseech your majesty
To take our brother Clarence to your grace
Why madam have I offerd love for this
To be so bouted in this royal presence
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead
They all start
You do him injury to scorn his corse
Who knows not he is dead who knows he is
All seeing heaven what a world is this
Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest
Ay my good lord and no one in this presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
Is Clarence dead the order was reversed
But he poor soul by your first order died
And that a winged Mercury did bear
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand
That came too lag to see him buried
God grant that some less noble and less loyal
Nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did
And yet go current from suspicion
Enter DERBY
A boon my sovereign for my service done
I pray thee peace my soul is full of sorrow
I will not rise unless your highness grant
Then speak at once what is it thou demandst
The forfeit sovereign of my servants life
Who slew today a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk
Have a tongue to doom my brothers death
And shall the same give pardon to a slave
My brother slew no man his fault was thought
And yet his punishment was cruel death
Who sued to me for him who in my rage
Kneeld at my feet and bade me be advised
Who spake of brotherhood who spake of love
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me
Who told me in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down he rescued me
And said Dear brother live and be a king
Who told me when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death how he did lap me
Even in his own garments and gave himself
All thin and naked to the numb cold night
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluckd and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind
But when your carters or your waitingvassals
Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer
You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
And I unjustly too must grant it you
But for my brother not a man would speak
Nor I ungracious speak unto myself
For him poor soul The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life
Yet none of you would once plead for his life
O God I fear thy justice will take hold
On me and you and mine and yours for this
Come Hastings help me to my closet
Oh poor Clarence
Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET
This is the fruit of rashness Markd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Lookd pale when they did hear of Clarence death
O they did urge it still unto the king
God will revenge it But come let us in
To comfort Edward with our company
We wait upon your grace
Exeunt
Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK with the two children of CLARENCE
Tell me good grandam is our father dead
No boy
Why do you wring your hands and beat your breast
And cry O Clarence my unhappy son
Why do you look on us and shake your head
And call us wretches orphans castaways
If that our noble father be alive
My pretty cousins you mistake me much
I do lament the sickness of the king
As loath to lose him not your fathers death
It were lost sorrow to wail one thats lost
Then grandam you conclude that he is dead
The king my uncle is to blame for this
God will revenge it whom I will importune
With daily prayers all to that effect
And so will I
Peace children peace the king doth love you well
Incapable and shallow innocents
You cannot guess who caused your fathers death
Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me the king provoked by the queen
Devised impeachments to imprison him 
And when my uncle told me so he wept
And huggd me in his arm and kindly kissd my cheek
Bade me rely on him as on my father
And he would love me dearly as his child
Oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile
He is my son yea and therein my shame
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
Ay boy
I cannot think it Hark what noise is this
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH with her hair about her ears RIVERS and DORSET after her
Oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
To chide my fortune and torment myself
Ill join with black despair against my soul
And to myself become an enemy
Edward my lord your son our king is dead
Why grow the branches now the root is witherd
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone
If you will live lament if die be brief
That our swiftwinged souls may catch the kings
Or like obedient subjects follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest
Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband
I have bewept a worthy husbands death
And lived by looking on his images
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crackd in pieces by malignant death
And I for comfort have but one false glass
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him
Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee
But death hath snatchd my husband from mine arms
And pluckd two crutches from my feeble limbs
Edward and Clarence O what cause have I
Thine being but a moiety of my grief
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries
Good aunt you wept not for our fathers death
How can we aid you with our kindred tears
Our fatherless distress was left unmoand
Your widowdolour likewise be unwept
Give me no help in lamentation
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
That I being governd by the watery moon
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
Oh for my husband for my dear lord Edward
Oh for our father for our dear lord Clarence
Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence
What stay had I but Edward and hes gone
What stay had we but Clarence and hes gone
What stays had I but they and they are gone
Was never widow had so dear a loss
Were never orphans had so dear a loss
Was never mother had so dear a loss
Alas I am the mother of these moans
Their woes are parcelld mine are general
She for an Edward weeps and so do I
I for a Clarence weep so doth not she
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I
I for an Edward weep so do not they
Alas you three on me threefold distressd
Pour all your tears I am your sorrows nurse
And I will pamper it with lamentations
Comfort dear mother God is much displeased
That you take with unthankfulness his doing
In common worldly things tis calld ungrateful
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven
For it requires the royal debt it lent you
Madam bethink you like a careful mother
Of the young prince your son send straight for him
Let him be crownd in him your comfort lives
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edwards grave
And plant your joys in living Edwards throne
Enter GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM DERBY HASTINGS and RATCLIFF
Madam have comfort all of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star
But none can cure their harms by wailing them
Madam my mother I do cry you mercy
I did not see your grace humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing
God bless thee and put meekness in thy mind
Love charity obedience and true duty
Aside  Amen and make me die a good old man
That is the buttend of a mothers blessing
I marvel why her grace did leave it out
You cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan
Now cheer each other in each others love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king
We are to reap the harvest of his son
The broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
But lately splinterd knit and joind together
Must gently be preserved cherishd and kept
Me seemeth good that with some little train
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetchd
Hither to London to be crownd our king
Why with some little train my Lord of Buckingham
Marry my lord lest by a multitude
The newheald wound of malice should break out
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd
Where every horse bears his commanding rein
And may direct his course as please himself
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent
In my opinion ought to be prevented
I hope the king made peace with all of us
And so in me and so I think in all
Yet since it is but green it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach
Which haply by much company might be urged
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince
And so say I
Then be it so and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow
Madam and you my mother will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business
With all our harts
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
My lord whoever journeys to the Prince
For Gods sake let not us two be behind
For by the way Ill sort occasion
As index to the story we late talkd of
To part the queens proud kindred from the king
My other self my counsels consistory
My oracle my prophet My dear cousin
I like a child will go by thy direction
Towards Ludlow then for well not stay behind
Exeunt
Enter two Citizens meeting
Neighbour well met whither away so fast
I promise you I scarcely know myself
Hear you the news abroad
Ay that the king is dead
Bad news byr lady seldom comes the better
I fear I fear twill prove a troublous world
Enter another Citizen
Neighbours God speed
Give you good morrow sir
Doth this news hold of good King Edwards death
Ay sir it is too true God help the while
Then masters look to see a troublous world
No no by Gods good grace his son shall reign
Woe to the land thats governd by a child
In him there is a hope of government
That in his nonage council under him
And in his full and ripend years himself
No doubt shall then and till then govern well
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crownd in Paris but at nine months old
Stood the state so No no good friends God wot
For then this land was famously enrichd
With politic grave counsel then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
Why so hath this both by the father and mother
Better it were they all came by the father
Or by the father there were none at all
For emulation now who shall be nearest
Will touch us all too near if God prevent not
O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester
And the queens sons and brothers haught and proud
And were they to be ruled and not to rule
This sickly land might solace as before
Come come we fear the worst all shall be well
When clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks
When great leaves fall the winter is at hand
When the sun sets who doth not look for night
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth
All may be well but if God sort it so
Tis more than we deserve or I expect
Truly the souls of men are full of dread
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of fear
Before the times of change still is it so
By a divine instinct mens minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers as by proof we see
The waters swell before a boisterous storm
But leave it all to God whither away
Marry we were sent for to the justices
And so was I Ill bear you company
Exeunt
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK young YORK QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
Last night I hear they lay at Northampton
At StonyStratford will they be tonight
Tomorrow or next day they will be here
I long with all my heart to see the prince
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him
But I hear no they say my son of York
Hath almost overtaen him in his growth
Ay mother but I would not have it so
Why my young cousin it is good to grow
Grandam one night as we did sit at supper
My uncle Rivers talkd how I did grow
More than my brother Ay quoth my uncle
Gloucester
Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace
And since methinks I would not grow so fast
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
Good faith good faith the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee
He was the wretchedst thing when he was young
So long agrowing and so leisurely
That if this rule were true he should be gracious
Why madam so no doubt he is
I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
Now by my troth if I had been rememberd
I could have given my uncles grace a flout
To touch his growth nearer than he touchd mine
How my pretty York I pray thee let me hear it
Marry they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth
Grandam this would have been a biting jest
I pray thee pretty York who told thee this
Grandam his nurse
His nurse why she was dead ere thou wert born
If twere not she I cannot tell who told me
A parlous boy go to you are too shrewd
Good madam be not angry with the child
Pitchers have ears
Enter a Messenger
Here comes a messenger What news
Such news my lord as grieves me to unfold
How fares the prince
Well madam and in health
What is thy news then
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisoners
Who hath committed them
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham
For what offence
The sum of all I can I have disclosed
Why or for what these nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me my gracious lady
Ay me I see the downfall of our house
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne
Welcome destruction death and massacre
I see as in a map the end of all
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days
How many of you have mine eyes beheld
My husband lost his life to get the crown
And often up and down my sons were tossd
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss
And being seated and domestic broils
Clean overblown themselves the conquerors
Make war upon themselves blood against blood
Self against self O preposterous
And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
Or let me die to look on death no more
Come come my boy we will to sanctuary
Madam farewell
Ill go along with you
You have no cause
My gracious lady go
And thither bear your treasure and your goods
For my part Ill resign unto your grace
The seal I keep and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours
Come Ill conduct you to the sanctuary
Exeunt
The trumpets sound Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM CARDINAL CATESBY and others
Welcome sweet prince to London to your chamber
Welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
The weary way hath made you melancholy
No uncle but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me
Sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the worlds deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show which God he knows
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
Those uncles which you want were dangerous
Your grace attended to their sugard words
But lookd not on the poison of their hearts 
God keep you from them and from such false friends
God keep me from false friends but they were none
My lord the mayor of London comes to greet you
Enter the Lord Mayor and his train
God bless your grace with health and happy days
I thank you good my lord and thank you all
I thought my mother and my brother York
Would long ere this have met us on the way
Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not
To tell us whether they will come or no
Enter HASTINGS
And in good time here comes the sweating lord
Welcome my lord what will our mother come
On what occasion God he knows not I
The queen your mother and your brother York
Have taken sanctuary the tender prince
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace
But by his mother was perforce withheld
Fie what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers Lord cardinal will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently
If she deny Lord Hastings go with him
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
My Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York
Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin
You are too senselessobstinate my lord
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age
You break not sanctuary in seizing him
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place
And those who have the wit to claim the place
This prince hath neither claimd it nor deserved it
And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
Then taking him from thence that is not there
You break no privilege nor charter there
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men
But sanctuary children neer till now
My lord you shall oerrule my mind for once
Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me
I go my lord
Good lords make all the speedy haste you may
Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
Say uncle Gloucester if our brother come
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation
Where it seems best unto your royal self
If I may counsel you some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower
Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation
I do not like the Tower of any place
Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord
He did my gracious lord begin that place
Which since succeeding ages have reedified
Is it upon record or else reported
Successively from age to age he built it
Upon record my gracious lord
But say my lord it were not registerd
Methinks the truth should live from age to age
As twere retaild to all posterity
Even to the general allending day
Aside  So wise so young they say do never
live long
What say you uncle
Aside
Thus like the formal vice Iniquity
I moralize two meanings in one word
That Julius Caesar was a famous man
With what his valour did enrich his wit
His wit set down to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror
For now he lives in fame though not in life
Ill tell you what my cousin Buckingham
What my gracious lord
An if I live until I be a man
Ill win our ancient right in France again
Or die a soldier as I lived a king
Aside  Short summers lightly have a forward spring
Enter young YORK HASTINGS and the CARDINAL
Now in good time here comes the Duke of York
Richard of York how fares our loving brother
Well my dread lord so must I call you now
Ay brother to our grief as it is yours
Too late he died that might have kept that title
Which by his death hath lost much majesty
How fares our cousin noble Lord of York
I thank you gentle uncle O my lord
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far
He hath my lord
And therefore is he idle
O my fair cousin I must not say so
Then is he more beholding to you than I
He may command me as my sovereign
But you have power in me as in a kinsman
I pray you uncle give me this dagger
My dagger little cousin with all my heart
A beggar brother
Of my kind uncle that I know will give
And being but a toy which is no grief to give
A greater gift than that Ill give my cousin
A greater gift O thats the sword to it
A gentle cousin were it light enough
O then I see you will part but with light gifts
In weightier things youll say a beggar nay
It is too heavy for your grace to wear
I weigh it lightly were it heavier
What would you have my weapon little lord
I would that I might thank you as you call me
How
Little
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk
Uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
You mean to bear me not to bear with me
Uncle my brother mocks both you and me
Because that I am little like an ape
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
With what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
He prettily and aptly taunts himself
So cunning and so young is wonderful
My lord willt please you pass along
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you
What will you go unto the Tower my lord
My lord protector needs will have it so
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower
Why what should you fear
Marry my uncle Clarence angry ghost
My grandam told me he was murdered there
I fear no uncles dead
Nor none that live I hope
An if they live I hope I need not fear
But come my lord and with a heavy heart
Thinking on them go I unto the Tower
A Sennet Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY
Think you my lord this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
No doubt no doubt O tis a parlous boy
Bold quick ingenious forward capable
He is all the mothers from the top to toe
Well let them rest Come hither Catesby
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart
Thou knowst our reasons urged upon the way
What thinkst thou is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind
For the instalment of this noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle
He for his fathers sake so loves the prince
That he will not be won to aught against him
What thinkst thou then of Stanley what will he
He will do all in all as Hastings doth
Well then no more but this go gentle Catesby
And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings
How doth he stand affected to our purpose
And summon him tomorrow to the Tower
To sit about the coronation
Encourage him and show him all our reasons
If he be leaden icycold unwilling
Be thou so too and so break off your talk
And give us notice of his inclination
For we tomorrow hold divided councils
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employd
Commend me to Lord William tell him Catesby
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfretcastle
And bid my friend for joy of this good news
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more
Good Catesby go effect this business soundly
My good lords both with all the heed I may
Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep
You shall my lord
At Crosby Place there shall you find us both
Exit CATESBY
Now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots
Chop off his head man somewhat we will do
And look when I am king claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
Whereof the king my brother stood possessd
Ill claim that promise at your graces hands
And look to have it yielded with all willingness
Come let us sup betimes that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form
Exeunt
Enter a Messenger
What ho my lord
Within  Who knocks at the door
A messenger from the Lord Stanley
Enter HASTINGS
What ist oclock
Upon the stroke of four
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights
So it should seem by that I have to say
First he commends him to your noble lordship
And then
And then he sends you word
He dreamt tonight the boar had razed his helm
Besides he says there are two councils held
And that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other
Therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure
If presently you will take horse with him
And with all speed post with him toward the north
To shun the danger that his soul divines
Go fellow go return unto thy lord
Bid him not fear the separated councils
His honour and myself are at the one
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence
Tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance
And for his dreams I wonder he is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase
Go bid thy master rise and come to me
And we will both together to the Tower
Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
My gracious lord Ill tell him what you say
Exit
Enter CATESBY
Many good morrows to my noble lord
Good morrow Catesby you are early stirring
What news what news in this our tottering state
It is a reeling world indeed my lord
And I believe twill never stand upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm
How wear the garland dost thou mean the crown
Ay my good lord
Ill have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
Ay on my life and hopes to find forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof
And thereupon he sends you this good news
That this same very day your enemies
The kindred of the queen must die at Pomfret
Indeed I am no mourner for that news
Because they have been still mine enemies
But that Ill give my voice on Richards side
To bar my masters heirs in true descent
God knows I will not do it to the death
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind
But I shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence
That they who brought me in my masters hate
I live to look upon their tragedy
I tell thee Catesby
What my lord
Ere a fortnight make me elder
Ill send some packing that yet think not on it
Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
When men are unprepared and look not for it
O monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
With Rivers Vaughan Grey and so twill do
With some men else who think themselves as safe
As thou and I who as thou knowst are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham
The princes both make high account of you
Aside
For they account his head upon the bridge
I know they do and I have well deserved it
Enter STANLEY
Come on come on where is your boarspear man
Fear you the boar and go so unprovided
My lord good morrow good morrow Catesby
You may jest on but by the holy rood
I do not like these several councils I
My lord
I hold my life as dear as you do yours
And never in my life I do protest
Was it more precious to me than tis now
Think you but that I know our state secure
I would be so triumphant as I am
The lords at Pomfret when they rode from London
Were jocund and supposed their state was sure
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust
But yet you see how soon the day oercast
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt
Pray God I say I prove a needless coward
What shall we toward the Tower the day is spent
Come come have with you Wot you what my lord
Today the lords you talk of are beheaded
They for their truth might better wear their heads
Than some that have accused them wear their hats
But come my lord let us away
Enter a Pursuivant
Go on before Ill talk with this good fellow
Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
How now sirrah how goes the world with thee
The better that your lordship please to ask
I tell thee man tis better with me now
Than when I met thee last where now we meet
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
By the suggestion of the queens allies
But now I tell theekeep it to thyself
This day those enemies are put to death
And I in better state than eer I was
God hold it to your honours good content
Gramercy fellow there drink that for me
Throws him his purse
God save your lordship
Exit
Enter a Priest
Well met my lord I am glad to see your honour
I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart
I am in your debt for your last exercise
Come the next Sabbath and I will content you
He whispers in his ear
Enter BUCKINGHAM
What talking with a priest lord chamberlain
Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand
Good faith and when I met this holy man
Those men you talk of came into my mind
What go you toward the Tower
I do my lord but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence
Tis like enough for I stay dinner there
Aside  And supper too although thou knowst it not
Come will you go
Ill wait upon your lordship
Exeunt
Enter RATCLIFF with halberds carrying RIVERS GREY and VAUGHAN to death
Come bring forth the prisoners
Sir Richard Ratcliff let me tell thee this
Today shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth for duty and for loyalty
God keep the prince from all the pack of you
A knot you are of damned bloodsuckers
You live that shall cry woe for this after
Dispatch the limit of your lives is out
O Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison
Fatal and ominous to noble peers
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hackd to death
And for more slander to thy dismal seat
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink
Now Margarets curse is falln upon our heads
For standing by when Richard stabbd her son
Then cursed she Hastings then cursed she Buckingham
Then cursed she Richard O remember God
To hear her prayers for them as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons
Be satisfied dear God with our true blood
Which as thou knowst unjustly must be spilt
Make haste the hour of death is expiate
Come Grey come Vaughan let us all embrace
And take our leave until we meet in heaven
Exeunt
Enter BUCKINGHAM DERBY HASTINGS the BISHOP OF  ELY RATCLIFF LOVEL with others and take their seats at a table
My lords at once the cause why we are met
Is to determine of the coronation
In Gods name speak when is the royal day
Are all things fitting for that royal time
It is and wants but nomination
Tomorrow then I judge a happy day
Who knows the lord protectors mind herein
Who is most inward with the royal duke
Your grace we think should soonest know his mind
Who I my lord I we know each others faces
But for our hearts he knows no more of mine
Than I of yours
Nor I no more of his than you of mine
Lord Hastings you and he are near in love
I thank his grace I know he loves me well
But for his purpose in the coronation
I have not sounded him nor he deliverd
His gracious pleasure any way therein
But you my noble lords may name the time
And in the dukes behalf Ill give my voice
Which I presume hell take in gentle part
Enter GLOUCESTER
Now in good time here comes the duke himself
My noble lords and cousins all good morrow
I have been long a sleeper but I hope
My absence doth neglect no great designs
Which by my presence might have been concluded
Had not you come upon your cue my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part
I mean your voicefor crowning of the king
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder
His lordship knows me well and loves me well
I thank your grace
My lord of Ely
My lord
When I was last in Holborn
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them
Marry and will my lord with all my heart
Exit
Cousin of Buckingham a word with you
Drawing him aside
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
And finds the testy gentleman so hot
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His masters son as worshipful as he terms it
Shall lose the royalty of Englands throne
Withdraw you hence my lord Ill follow you
Exit GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM following
We have not yet set down this day of triumph
Tomorrow in mine opinion is too sudden
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be were the day prolongd
Reenter BISHOP OF ELY
Where is my lord protector I have sent for these
strawberries
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth today
Theres some conceit or other likes him well
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit
I think theres never a man in Christendom
That can less hide his love or hate than he
For by his face straight shall you know his heart
What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he showd today
Marry that with no man here he is offended
For were he he had shown it in his looks
I pray God he be not I say
Reenter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
I pray you all tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft and that have prevaild
Upon my body with their hellish charms
The tender love I bear your grace my lord
Makes me most forward in this noble presence
To doom the offenders whatsoever they be
I say my lord they have deserved death
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill
See how I am bewitchd behold mine arm
Is like a blasted sapling witherd up
And this is Edwards wife that monstrous witch
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me
If they have done this thing my gracious lord
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet
Tellest thou me of ifs  Thou art a traitor
Off with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear
I will not dine until I see the same
Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done
The rest that love me rise and follow me
Exeunt all but HASTINGS RATCLIFF and LOVEL
Woe woe for England not a whit for me
For I too fond might have prevented this
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
But I disdaind it and did scorn to fly
Three times today my footcloth horse did stumble
And startled when he lookd upon the Tower
As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
O now I want the priest that spake to me
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As twere triumphing at mine enemies
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcherd
And I myself secure in grace and favour
O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings wretched head
Dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner
Make a short shrift he longs to see your head
O momentary grace of mortal men
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
Ready with every nod to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep
Come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim
O bloody Richard miserable England
I prophesy the fearfulst time to thee
That ever wretched age hath lookd upon
Come lead me to the block bear him my head
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead
Exeunt
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour marvellous illfavoured
Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word
And then begin again and stop again
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror
Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian
Speak and look back and pry on every side
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw
Intending deep suspicion ghastly looks
Are at my service like enforced smiles
And both are ready in their offices
At any time to grace my stratagems
But what is Catesby gone
He is and see he brings the mayor along
Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY
Lord mayor
Look to the drawbridge there
Hark a drum
Catesby oerlook the walls
Lord mayor the reason we have sent
Look back defend thee here are enemies
God and our innocency defend and guard us
Be patient they are friends Ratcliff and Lovel
Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF with HASTINGS head
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings
So dear I loved the man that I must weep
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christian
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts
So smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue
That his apparent open guilt omitted
I mean his conversation with Shores wife
He lived from all attainder of suspect
Well well he was the covertst shelterd traitor
That ever lived
Would you imagine or almost believe
Weret not that by great preservation
We live to tell it you the subtle traitor
This day had plotted in the councilhouse
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester
What had he so
What think You we are Turks or infidels
Or that we would against the form of law
Proceed thus rashly to the villains death
But that the extreme peril of the case
The peace of England and our persons safety
Enforced us to this execution
Now fair befall you he deserved his death
And you my good lords both have well proceeded
To warn false traitors from the like attempts
I never lookd for better at his hands
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore
Yet had not we determined he should die
Until your lordship came to see his death
Which now the loving haste of these our friends
Somewhat against our meaning have prevented
Because my lord we would have had you heard
The traitor speak and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death
But my good lord your graces word shall serve
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
And doubt you not right noble princes both
But Ill acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings in this cause
And to that end we wishd your lordship here
To avoid the carping censures of the world
But since you come too late of our intents
Yet witness what you hear we did intend
And so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
Exit Lord Mayor
Go after after cousin Buckingham
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post
There at your meetst advantage of the time
Infer the bastardy of Edwards children
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
Which by the sign thereof was termed so
Moreover urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust
Which stretched to their servants daughters wives
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart
Without control listed to make his prey
Nay for a need thus far come near my person
Tell them when that my mother went with child
Of that unsatiate Edward noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And by just computation of the time
Found that the issue was not his begot
Which well appeared in his lineaments
Being nothing like the noble duke my father
But touch this sparingly as twere far off
Because you know my lord my mother lives
Fear not my lord Ill play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself and so my lord adieu
If you thrive well bring them to Baynards Castle
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and welllearned bishops
I go and towards three or four oclock
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords
Exit BUCKINGHAM
Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw
To CATESBY
Go thou to Friar Penker bid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynards Castle
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Now will I in to take some privy order
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight
And to give notice that no manner of person
At any time have recourse unto the princes
Exit
Enter a Scrivener with a paper in his hand
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings
Which in a set hand fairly is engrossd
That it may be this day read over in Pauls
And mark how well the sequel hangs together
Eleven hours I spent to write it over
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me
The precedent was full as long adoing
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings
Untainted unexamined free at liberty
Heres a good world the while Why whos so gross
That seeth not this palpable device
Yet whos so blind but says he sees it not
Bad is the world and all will come to nought
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought
Exit
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM at several doors
How now my lord what say the citizens
Now by the holy mother of our Lord
The citizens are mum and speak not a word
Touchd you the bastardy of Edwards children
The insatiate greediness of his desires
And his enforcement of the city wives
His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
As being got your father then in France
His resemblance being not like the duke
Withal I did infer your lineaments
Being the right idea of your father
Both in your form and nobleness of mind
Laid open all your victories in Scotland
Your dicipline in war wisdom in peace
Your bounty virtue fair humility
Indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouchd or slightly handled in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their countrys good
Cry God save Richard Englands royal king
Ah and did they so
No so God help me they spake not a word
But like dumb statues or breathing stones
Gazed each on other and lookd deadly pale
Which when I saw I reprehended them
And askd the mayor what meant this wilful silence
His answer was the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder
Then he was urged to tell my tale again
Thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd
But nothing spake in warrant from himself
When he had done some followers of mine own
At the lower end of the hall hurld up their caps
And some ten voices cried God save King Richard
And thus I took the vantage of those few
Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I
This general applause and loving shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard
And even here brake off and came away
What tongueless blocks were they would not they speak
No by my troth my lord
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come
The mayor is here at hand intend some fear
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
And look you get a prayerbook in your hand
And stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord
For on that ground Ill build a holy descant
And be not easily won to our request
Play the maids part still answer nay and take it
I go and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue
Go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks
Exit GLOUCESTER
Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens
Welcome my lord I dance attendance here
I think the duke will not be spoke withal
Enter CATESBY
Here comes his servant how now Catesby
What says he
My lord he doth entreat your grace
To visit him tomorrow or next day
He is within with two right reverend fathers
Divinely bent to meditation
And no worldly suit would he be moved
To draw him from his holy exercise
Return good Catesby to thy lord again
Tell him myself the mayor and citizens
In deep designs and matters of great moment
No less importing than our general good
Are come to have some conference with his grace
Ill tell him what you say my lord
Exit
Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward
He is not lolling on a lewd daybed
But on his knees at meditation
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans
But meditating with two deep divines
Not sleeping to engross his idle body
But praying to enrich his watchful soul
Happy were England would this gracious prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof
But sure I fear we shall neer win him to it
Marry God forbid his grace should say us nay
I fear he will
Reenter CATESBY
How now Catesby what says your lord
My lord
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak with him
His grace not being warnd thereof before
My lord he fears you mean no good to him
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me that I mean no good to him
By heaven I come in perfect love to him
And so once more return and tell his grace
Exit CATESBY
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence
So sweet is zealous contemplation
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft between two Bishops CATESBY returns
See where he stands between two clergymen
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince
To stay him from the fall of vanity
And see a book of prayer in his hand
True ornaments to know a holy man
Famous Plantagenet most gracious prince
Lend favourable ears to our request
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal
My lord there needs no such apology
I rather do beseech you pardon me
Who earnest in the service of my God
Neglect the visitation of my friends
But leaving this what is your graces pleasure
Even that I hope which pleaseth God above
And all good men of this ungovernd isle
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the citys eyes
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance
You have my lord would it might please your grace
At our entreaties to amend that fault
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land
Then know it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat the throne majestical
The scepterd office of your ancestors
Your state of fortune and your due of birth
The lineal glory of your royal house
To the corruption of a blemished stock
Whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
Which here we waken to our countrys good
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs
Her face defaced with scars of infamy
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
And almost shoulderd in the swallowing gulf
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion
Which to recure we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land
Not as protector steward substitute
But as successively from blood to blood
Your right of birth your empery your own
For this consorted with the citizens
Your very worshipful and loving friends
And by their vehement instigation
In this just suit come I to move your grace
I know not whether to depart in silence
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer you might haply think
Tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
Which fondly you would here impose on me
If to reprove you for this suit of yours
So seasond with your faithful love to me
Then on the other side I chequed my friends
Therefore to speak and to avoid the first
And then in speaking not to incur the last
Definitively thus I answer you
Your love deserves my thanks but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request
First if all obstacles were cut away
And that my path were even to the crown
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit
So mighty and so many my defects
As I had rather hide me from my greatness
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea
Than in my greatness covet to be hid
And in the vapour of my glory smotherd
But God be thankd theres no need of me
And much I need to help you if need were
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
Which mellowd by the stealing hours of time
Will well become the seat of majesty
And make no doubt us happy by his reign
On him I lay what you would lay on me
The right and fortune of his happy stars
Which God defend that I should wring from him
My lord this argues conscience in your grace
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial
All circumstances well considered
You say that Edward is your brothers son
So say we too but not by Edwards wife
Your mother lives a witness to that vow
And afterward by substitute betrothd
To Bona sister to the King of France
These both put by a poor petitioner
A carecrazed mother of a many children
A beautywaning and distressed widow
Even in the afternoon of her best days
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her in his unlawful bed he got
This Edward whom our manners term the prince
More bitterly could I expostulate
Save that for reverence to some alive
I give a sparing limit to my tongue
Then good my lord take to your royal self
This profferd benefit of dignity
If non to bless us and the land withal
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times
Unto a lineal truederived course
Do good my lord your citizens entreat you
Refuse not mighty lord this profferd love
O make them joyful grant their lawful suit
Alas why would you heap these cares on me
I am unfit for state and majesty
I do beseech you take it not amiss
I cannot nor I will not yield to you
If you refuse itas in love and zeal
Loath to depose the child Your brothers son
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle kind effeminate remorse
Which we have noted in you to your kin
And egally indeed to all estates
Yet whether you accept our suit or no
Your brothers son shall never reign our king
But we will plant some other in the throne
To the disgrace and downfall of your house
And in this resolution here we leave you
Come citizens zounds Ill entreat no more
O do not swear my lord of Buckingham
Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens
Call them again my lord and accept their suit
Do good my lord lest all the land do rue it
Would you enforce me to a world of care
Well call them again I am not made of stone
But penetrable to your kind entreats
Albeit against my conscience and my soul
Reenter BUCKINGHAM and the rest
Cousin of Buckingham and you sage grave men
Since you will buckle fortune on my back
To bear her burthen whether I will or no
I must have patience to endure the load
But if black scandal or foulfaced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof
For God he knows and you may partly see
How far I am from the desire thereof
God bless your grace we see it and will say it
In saying so you shall but say the truth
Then I salute you with this kingly title
Long live Richard Englands royal king
Amen
Tomorrow will it please you to be crownd
Even when you please since you will have it so
Tomorrow then we will attend your grace
And so most joyfully we take our leave
Come let us to our holy task again
Farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends

Who m eets us here  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester
Now for my life shes wandering to the Tower
On pure hearts love to greet the tender princes
Daughter well met

Kind sister thanks well enter all together
Enter BRAKENBURY
And in good time here the lieutenant comes
Master lieutenant pray you by your leave
How doth the prince and my young son of York
Right well dear madam By your patience
I may not suffer you to visit them
The king hath straitly charged the contrary
The king why whos that
I cry you mercy I mean the lord protector
The Lord protect him from that kingly title
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me
I am their mother who should keep me from them
I am their fathers mother I will see them
Their aunt I am in law in love their mother
Then bring me to their sights Ill bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee on my peril
No madam no I may not leave it so
I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me
Exit
Enter LORD STANLEY
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence
And Ill salute your grace of York as mother
And reverend looker on of two fair queens
To LADY ANNE
Come madam you must straight to Westminster
There to be crowned Richards royal queen
O cut my lace in sunder that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat or else I swoon
With this deadkilling news
Despiteful tidings O unpleasing news
Be of good cheer mother how fares your grace
O Dorset speak not to me get thee hence
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels
Thy mothers name is ominous to children
If thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas
And live with Richmond from the reach of hell
Go hie thee hie thee from this slaughterhouse
Lest thou increase the number of the dead
And make me die the thrall of Margarets curse
Nor mother wife nor Englands counted queen
Full of wise care is this your counsel madam
Take all the swift advantage of the hours
You shall have letters from me to my son
To meet you on the way and welcome you
Be not taen tardy by unwise delay
O illdispersing wind of misery
O my accursed womb the bed of death
A cockatrice hast thou hatchd to the world
Whose unavoided eye is murderous
Come madam come I in all haste was sent
And I in all unwillingness will go
I would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were redhot steel to sear me to the brain
Anointed let me be with deadly venom
And die ere men can say God save the queen
Go go poor soul I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour wish thyself no harm
No why  When he that is my husband now
Came to me as I followd Henrys corse
When scarce the blood was well washd from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping followd
O when I say I lookd on Richards face
This was my wish Be thou quoth I  accursed
For making me so young so old a widow
And when thou wedst let sorrow haunt thy bed
And be thy wifeif any be so mad
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lords death
Lo ere I can repeat this curse again
Even in so short a space my womans heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own souls curse
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoyd the golden dew of sleep
But have been waked by his timorous dreams
Besides he hates me for my father Warwick
And will no doubt shortly be rid of me
Poor heart adieu I pity thy complaining
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours
Farewell thou woful welcomer of glory
Adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it
To DORSET
Go thou to Richmond and good fortune guide thee
To LADY ANNE
Go thou to Richard and good angels guard thee
To QUEEN ELIZABETH
Go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee
I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen
And each hours joy wrecked with a week of teen
Stay yet look back with me unto the Tower
Pity you ancient stones those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your walls
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones
Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
For tender princes use my babies well
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell
Exeunt
Sennet Enter KING RICHARD III in pomp crowned BUCKINGHAM CATESBY a page and others
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham
My gracious sovereign
Give me thy hand
Here he ascendeth his throne
Thus high by thy advice
And thy assistance is King Richard seated
But shall we wear these honours for a day
Or shall they last and we rejoice in them
Still live they and for ever may they last
O Buckingham now do I play the touch
To try if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward lives think now what I would say
Say on my loving lord
Why Buckingham I say I would be king
Why so you are my thrice renowned liege
Ha am I king tis so but Edward lives
True noble prince
O bitter consequence
That Edward still should live True noble prince
Cousin thou wert not wont to be so dull
Shall I be plain I wish the bastards dead
And I would have it suddenly performd
What sayest thou speak suddenly be brief
Your grace may do your pleasure
Tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezeth
Say have I thy consent that they shall die
Give me some breath some little pause my lord
Before I positively herein
I will resolve your grace immediately
Exit
Aside to a stander by
The king is angry see he bites the lip
I will converse with ironwitted fools
And unrespective boys none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes
Highreaching Buckingham grows circumspect
Boy
My lord
Knowst thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death
My lord I know a discontented gentleman
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind
Gold were as good as twenty orators
And will no doubt tempt him to any thing
What is his name
His name my lord is Tyrrel
I partly know the man go call him hither
Exit Page
The deeprevolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel
Hath he so long held out with me untired
And stops he now for breath
Enter STANLEY
How now what news with you
My lord I hear the Marquis Dorsets fled
To Richmond in those parts beyond the sea
Where he abides
Stands apart
Catesby
My lord
Rumour it abroad
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die
I will take order for her keeping close
Inquire me out some meanborn gentleman
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence daughter
The boy is foolish and I fear not him
Look how thou dreamst I say again give out
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die
About it for it stands me much upon
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me
Exit CATESBY
I must be married to my brothers daughter
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass
Murder her brothers and then marry her
Uncertain way of gain But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin
Tearfalling pity dwells not in this eye
Reenter Page with TYRREL
Is thy name Tyrrel
James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject
Art thou indeed
Prove me my gracious sovereign
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine
Ay my lord
But I had rather kill two enemies
Why there thou hast it two deep enemies
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleeps disturbers
Are they that I would have thee deal upon
Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower
Let me have open means to come to them
And soon Ill rid you from the fear of them
Thou singst sweet music Hark come hither Tyrrel
Go by this token rise and lend thine ear
Whispers
There is no more but so say it is done
And I will love thee and prefer thee too
Tis done my gracious lord
Shall we hear from thee Tyrrel ere we sleep
Ye shall my Lord
Exit
Reenter BUCKINGHAM
My Lord I have considerd in my mind
The late demand that you did sound me in
Well let that pass Dorset is fled to Richmond
I hear that news my lord
Stanley he is your wifes son well look to it
My lord I claim your gift my due by promise
For which your honour and your faith is pawnd
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promised I should possess
Stanley look to your wife if she convey
Letters to Richmond you shall answer it
What says your highness to my just demand
As I remember Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king
When Richmond was a little peevish boy
A king perhaps perhaps
My lord
How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me I being by that I should kill him
My lord your promise for the earldom
Richmond When last I was at Exeter
The mayor in courtesy showd me the castle
And calld it Rougemont at which name I started
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw Richmond
My Lord
Ay whats oclock
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me
Well but whats oclock
Upon the stroke of ten
Well let it strike
Why let it strike
Because that like a Jack thou keepst the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation
I am not in the giving vein today
Why then resolve me whether you will or no
Tut tut
Thou troublest me am not in the vein
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM
Is it even so rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt made I him king for this
O let me think on Hastings and be gone
To Brecknock while my fearful head is on
Exit
Enter TYRREL
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done
The most arch of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of
Dighton and Forrest whom I did suborn
To do this ruthless piece of butchery
Although they were fleshd villains bloody dogs
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
Wept like two children in their deaths sad stories
Lo thus quoth Dighton lay those tender babes
Thus thus quoth Forrest girdling one another
Within their innocent alabaster arms
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk
Which in their summer beauty kissd each other
A book of prayers on their pillow lay
Which once quoth Forrest almost changed my mind
But O the devilthere the villain stoppd
Whilst Dighton thus told on We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature
That from the prime creation eer she framed
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse
They could not speak and so I left them both
To bring this tidings to the bloody king
And here he comes
Enter KING RICHARD III
All hail my sovereign liege
Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness be happy then
For it is done my lord
But didst thou see them dead
I did my lord
And buried gentle Tyrrel
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them
But how or in what place I do not know
Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper
And thou shalt tell the process of their death
Meantime but think how I may do thee good
And be inheritor of thy desire
Farewell till soon
Exit TYRREL
The son of Clarence have I pent up close
His daughter meanly have I matchd in marriage
The sons of Edward sleep in Abrahams bosom
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night
Now for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth my brothers daughter
And by that knot looks proudly oer the crown
To her I go a jolly thriving wooer
Enter CATESBY
My lord
Good news or bad that thou comest in so bluntly
Bad news my lord Ely is fled to Richmond
And Buckingham backd with the hardy Welshmen
Is in the field and still his power increaseth
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rashlevied army
Come I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay
Delay leads impotent and snailpaced beggary
Then fiery expedition be my wing
Joves Mercury and herald for a king
Come muster men my counsel is my shield
We must be brief when traitors brave the field
Exeunt
Enter QUEEN MARGARET
So now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death
Here in these confines slily have I lurkd
To watch the waning of mine adversaries
A dire induction am I witness to
And will to France hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter black and tragical
Withdraw thee wretched Margaret who comes here
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
Ah my young princes ah my tender babes
My unblown flowers newappearing sweets
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fixd in doom perpetual
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mothers lamentation
Hover about her say that right for right
Hath dimmd your infant morn to aged night
So many miseries have crazed my voice
That my woewearied tongue is mute and dumb
Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt
Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambs
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
When holy Harry died and my sweet son
Blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost
Rest thy unrest on Englands lawful earth
Sitting down
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents blood
O that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat
Then would I hide my bones not rest them here
O who hath any cause to mourn but I
Sitting down by her
If ancient sorrow be most reverend
Give mine the benefit of seniory
And let my woes frown on the upper hand
If sorrow can admit society
Sitting down with them
Tell oer your woes again by viewing mine
I had an Edward till a Richard killd him
I had a Harry till a Richard killd him
Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killd him
Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him
I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him
I had a Rutland too thou holpst to kill him
Thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard killd him
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
That dog that had his teeth before his eyes
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
That foul defacer of Gods handiwork
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
O upright just and truedisposing God
How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mothers body
And makes her pewfellow with others moan
O Harrys wife triumph not in my woes
God witness with me I have wept for thine
Bear with me I am hungry for revenge
And now I cloy me with beholding it
Thy Edward he is dead that stabbd my Edward
Thy other Edward dead to quit my Edward
Young York he is but boot because both they
Match not the high perfection of my loss
Thy Clarence he is dead that killd my Edward
And the beholders of this tragic play
The adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey
Untimely smotherd in their dusky graves
Richard yet lives hells black intelligencer
And send them thither but at hand at hand
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end
Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
To have him suddenly conveyd away
Cancel his bond of life dear God I prey
That I may live to say The dog is dead
O thou didst prophesy the time would come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider that foul bunchbackd toad
I calld thee then vain flourish of my fortune
I calld thee then poor shadow painted queen
The presentation of but what I was
The flattering index of a direful pageant
One heaved ahigh to be hurld down below
A mother only mockd with two sweet babes
A dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble
A sign of dignity a garish flag
To be the aim of every dangerous shot
Where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
Where are thy children wherein dost thou joy
Who sues to thee and cries God save the queen
Where be the bending peers that flatterd thee
Where be the thronging troops that followd thee
Decline all this and see what now thou art
For happy wife a most distressed widow
For joyful mother one that wails the name
For queen a very caitiff crownd with care
For one being sued to one that humbly sues
For one that scornd at me now scornd of me
For one being feard of all now fearing one
For one commanding all obeyd of none
Thus hath the course of justice wheeld about
And left thee but a very prey to time
Having no more but thought of what thou wert
To torture thee the more being what thou art
Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthend yoke
From which even here I slip my weary neck
And leave the burthen of it all on thee
Farewell Yorks wife and queen of sad mischance
These English woes will make me smile in France
O thou well skilld in curses stay awhile
And teach me how to curse mine enemies
Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days
Compare dead happiness with living woe
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were
And he that slew them fouler than he is
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse
My words are dull O quicken them with thine
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
Exit
Why should calamity be full of words
Windy attorneys to their client woes
Airy succeeders of intestate joys
Poor breathing orators of miseries
Let them have scope though what they do impart
Help not all yet do they ease the heart
If so then be not tonguetied go with me
And in the breath of bitter words lets smother
My damned son which thy two sweet sons smotherd
I hear his drum be copious in exclaims
Enter KING RICHARD III marching with drums and trumpets
Who intercepts my expedition
O she that might have intercepted thee
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown
Where should be graven if that right were right
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers
Tell me thou villain slave where are my children
Thou toad thou toad where is thy brother Clarence
And little Ned Plantagenet his son
Where is kind Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey
A flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women
Rail on the Lords enointed strike I say
Flourish Alarums
Either be patient and entreat me fair
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations
Art thou my son
Ay I thank God my father and yourself
Then patiently hear my impatience
Madam I have a touch of your condition
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof
O let me speak
Do then but Ill not hear
I will be mild and gentle in my speech
And brief good mother for I am in haste
Art thou so hasty I have stayd for thee
God knows in anguish pain and agony
And came I not at last to comfort you
No by the holy rood thou knowst it well
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
Thy schooldays frightful desperate wild and furious
Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
Thy age confirmd proud subdued bloody
treacherous
More mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
What comfortable hour canst thou name
That ever graced me in thy company
Faith none but Humphrey Hour that calld
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company
If I be so disgracious in your sight
Let me march on and not offend your grace
Strike the drum
I prithee hear me speak
You speak too bitterly
Hear me a word
For I shall never speak to thee again
So
Either thou wilt die by Gods just ordinance
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse
Which in the day of battle tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that thou wearst
My prayers on the adverse party fight
And there the little souls of Edwards children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory
Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
Exit
Though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me I say amen to all
Stay madam I must speak a word with you
I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to murder for my daughters Richard
They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
And therefore level not to hit their lives
You have a daughter calld Elizabeth
Virtuous and fair royal and gracious
And must she die for this O let her live
And Ill corrupt her manners stain her beauty
Slander myself as false to Edwards bed
Throw over her the veil of infamy
So she may live unscarrd of bleeding slaughter
I will confess she was not Edwards daughter
Wrong not her birth she is of royal blood
To save her life Ill say she is not so
Her life is only safest in her birth
And only in that safety died her brothers
Lo at their births good stars were opposite
No to their lives bad friends were contrary
All unavoided is the doom of destiny
True when avoided grace makes destiny
My babes were destined to a fairer death
If grace had blessd thee with a fairer life
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins
Cousins indeed and by their uncle cozend
Of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts
Thy head all indirectly gave direction
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
To revel in the entrails of my lambs
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes
And I in such a desperate bay of death
Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
Madam so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars
As I intend more good to you and yours
Than ever you or yours were by me wrongd
What good is coverd with the face of heaven
To be discoverd that can do me good
The advancement of your children gentle lady
Up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
No to the dignity and height of honour
The high imperial type of this earths glory
Flatter my sorrows with report of it
Tell me what state what dignity what honour
Canst thou demise to any child of mine
Even all I have yea and myself and all
Will I withal endow a child of thine
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee
Be brief lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness date
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter
My daughters mother thinks it with her soul
What do you think
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
So from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers
And from my hearts love I do thank thee for it
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
And mean to make her queen of England
Say then who dost thou mean shall be her king
Even he that makes her queen who should be else
What thou
I even I what think you of it madam
How canst thou woo her
That would I learn of you
As one that are best acquainted with her humour
And wilt thou learn of me
Madam with all my heart
Send to her by the man that slew her brothers
A pair of bleedinghearts thereon engrave
Edward and York then haply she will weep
Therefore present to heras sometime Margaret
Did to thy father steepd in Rutlands blood
A handkerchief which say to her did drain
The purple sap from her sweet brothers body
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith
If this inducement force her not to love
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence
Her uncle Rivers yea and for her sake
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne
Come come you mock me this is not the way
To win our daughter
There is no other way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
And not be Richard that hath done all this
Say that I did all this for love of her
Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil
Look what is done cannot be now amended
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
Which after hours give leisure to repent
If I did take the kingdom from your sons
To make amends Ill give it to your daughter
If I have killd the issue of your womb
To quicken your increase I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandams name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother
They are as children but one step below
Even of your mettle of your very blood
Of an one pain save for a night of groans
Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow
Your children were vexation to your youth
But mine shall be a comfort to your age
The loss you have is but a son being king
And by that loss your daughter is made queen
I cannot make you what amends I would
Therefore accept such kindness as I can
Dorset your son that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity
The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother
Again shall you be mother to a king
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repaird with double riches of content
What we have many goodly days to see
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again transformd to orient pearl
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness
Go then my mother to thy daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with your experience
Prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel dullbraind Buckingham
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed
To whom I will retail my conquest won
And she shall be sole victress Caesars Caesar
What were I best to say her fathers brother
Would be her lord or shall I say her uncle
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
Under what title shall I woo for thee
That God the law my honour and her love
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years
Infer fair Englands peace by this alliance
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war
Say that the king which may command entreats
That at her hands which the kings King forbids
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen
To wail the tide as her mother doth
Say I will love her everlastingly
But how long shall that title ever last
Sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it
So long as hell and Richard likes of it
Say I her sovereign am her subject love
But she your subject loathes such sovereignty
Be eloquent in my behalf to her
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick
O no my reasons are too deep and dead
Too deep and dead poor infants in their grave
Harp not on that string madam that is past
Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break
Now by my George my garter and my crown
Profaned dishonourd and the third usurpd
I swear
By nothing for this is no oath
The George profaned hath lost his holy honour
The garter blemishd pawnd his knightly virtue
The crown usurpd disgraced his kingly glory
if something thou wilt swear to be believed
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrongd
Now by the world
Tis full of thy foul wrongs
My fathers death
Thy life hath that dishonourd
Then by myself
Thyself thyself misusest
Why then by God
Gods wrong is most of all
If thou hadst feard to break an oath by Him
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken nor my brother slain
If thou hadst feard to break an oath by Him
The imperial metal circling now thy brow
Had graced the tender temples of my child
And both the princes had been breathing here
Which now two tender playfellows to dust
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
What canst thou swear by now
The time to come
That thou hast wronged in the time oerpast
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time for time past wrongd by thee
The children live whose parents thou hast
slaughterd
Ungovernd youth to wail it in their age
The parents live whose children thou hast butcherd
Old witherd plants to wail it with their age
Swear not by time to come for that thou hast
Misused ere used by time misused oerpast
As I intend to prosper and repent
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms myself myself confound
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
Day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings if with pure hearts love
Immaculate devotion holy thoughts
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
In her consists my happiness and thine
Without her follows to this land and me
To thee herself and many a Christian soul
Death desolation ruin and decay
It cannot be avoided but by this
It will not be avoided but by this
Therefore good motherI must can you so
Be the attorney of my love to her
Plead what I will be not what I have been
Not my deserts but what I will deserve
Urge the necessity and state of times
And be not peevishfond in great designs
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus
Ay if the devil tempt thee to do good
Shall I forget myself to be myself
Ay if yourselfs remembrance wrong yourself
But thou didst kill my children
But in your daughters womb I bury them
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves to your recomforture
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will
And be a happy mother by the deed
I go Write to me very shortly
And you shall understand from me her mind
Bear her my true loves kiss and so farewell
Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
Relenting fool and shallow changing woman
Enter RATCLIFF CATESBY following
How now what news
My gracious sovereign on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy to the shore
Throng many doubtful hollowhearted friends
Unarmd and unresolved to beat them back
Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral
And there they hull expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore
Some lightfoot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk
Ratcliff thyself or Catesby where is he
Here my lord
Fly to the duke
To RATCLIFF
Post thou to Salisbury
When thou comest thither
To CATESBY
Dull unmindful villain
Why standst thou still and gost not to the duke

The greatest strength and power he can make
And meet me presently at Salisbury

How now what news with you
None good my lord to please you with the hearing

Hoyday a riddle neither good nor bad
Why dost thou run so many mile about
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way
Once more what news
Richmond is on the seas
There let him sink and be the seas on him
Whiteliverd runagate what doth he there
I know not mighty sovereign but by guess
Well sir as you guess as you guess
Stirrd up by Dorset Buckingham and Ely
He makes for England there to claim the crown
Is the chair empty is the sword unswayd
Is the king dead the empire unpossessd
What heir of York is there alive but we
And who is Englands king but great Yorks heir
Then tell me what doth he upon the sea
Unless for that my liege I cannot guess
Unless for that he comes to be your liege
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear
No mighty liege therefore mistrust me not
Where is thy power then to beat him back
Where are thy tenants and thy followers
Are they not now upon the western shore
Safeconducting the rebels from their ships
No my good lord my friends are in the north
Cold friends to Richard what do they in the north
When they should serve their sovereign in the west
They have not been commanded mighty sovereign
Please it your majesty to give me leave
Ill muster up my friends and meet your grace
Where and what time your majesty shall please
Ay ay thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond
I will not trust you sir
Most mighty sovereign
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful
I never was nor never will be false
Well
Go muster men but hear you leave behind
Your son George Stanley look your faith be firm
Or else his heads assurance is but frail
So deal with him as I prove true to you

The news I have to tell your majesty
Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
Buckinghams army is dispersed and scatterd
And he himself wanderd away alone

Reward to him that brings the traitor in
Such proclamation hath been made my liege
Enter another Messenger
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset
Tis said my liege in Yorkshire are in arms
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest
Richmond in Yorkshire sent out a boat
Unto the shore to ask those on the banks
If they were his assistants yea or no
Who answerd him they came from Buckingham
Upon his party he mistrusting them
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany
March on march on since we are up in arms
If not to fight with foreign enemies
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home
Reenter CATESBY
My liege the Duke of Buckingham is taken
That is the best news that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
Is colder tidings yet they must be told

What men of name resort to him
Sir Walter Herbert a renowned soldier
Sir Gilbert Talbot Sir William Stanley

And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew
And many more of noble fame and worth

Do through the clouds behold this present hour
Even for revenge mock my destruction
This is AllSouls day fellows is it not
It is my lord
Why then AllSouls day is my bodys doomsday
This is the day that in King Edwards time
I wisht might fall on me when I was found
False to his children or his wifes allies
This is the day wherein I wishd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most
This this AllSouls day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs
That high AllSeer that I dallied with
Hath turnd my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I beggd in jest
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points on their masters bosoms
Now Margarets curse is fallen upon my head
When he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow
Remember Margaret was a prophetess
Come sirs convey me to the block of shame
Wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame

Lines of fair comfort and encouragement
The wretched bloody and usurping boar
That spoild your summer fields and fruitful vines
Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
In your embowelld bosoms this foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle
Near to the town of Leicester as we learn
From Tamworth thither is but one days march
In Gods name cheerly on courageous friends
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war
Every mans conscience is a thousand swords
To fight against that bloody homicide
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him
All for our vantage Then in Gods name march
True hope is swift and flies with swallows wings
Kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings

Who prays continually for Richmonds good

And flaky darkness breaks within the east
In brieffor so the season bids us be
Prepare thy battle early in the morning
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortalstaring war
I as I maythat which I would I cannot
With best advantage will deceive the time
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest being seen thy brother tender George
Be executed in his fathers sight
Farewell the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse
Which so long sunderd friends should dwell upon
God give us leisure for these rites of love
Once more adieu be valiant and speed well
Good lords conduct him to his regiment
Ill strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap
Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow
When I should mount with wings of victory
Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen
Exeunt all but RICHMOND
O Thou whose captain I account myself
Look on my forces with a gracious eye
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries
Make us thy ministers of chastisement
That we may praise thee in the victory
To thee I do commend my watchful soul
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes
Sleeping and waking O defend me still

KING RICHARD III starts out of his dream
Give me another horse bind up my wounds
Have mercy JesuSoft I did but dream
O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me
The lights burn blue It is now dead midnight
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh
What do I fear  myself  theres none else by
Richard loves Richard that is I am I
Is there a murderer here  No Yes I am
Then fly What from myself   Great reason why
Lest I revenge What myself upon myself
Alack I love myself Wherefore  for any good
That I myself have done unto myself
O no alas I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself
I am a villain yet I lie I am not
Fool of thyself speak well fool do not flatter
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues
And every tongue brings in a several tale
And every tale condemns me for a villain
Perjury perjury in the highst degree
Murder stem murder in the direst degree
All several sins all used in each degree
Throng to the bar crying all Guilty guilty
I shall despair There is no creature loves me
And if I die no soul shall pity me
Nay wherefore should they since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself
Methought the souls of all that I had murderd
Came to my tent and every one did threat
Tomorrows vengeance on the head of Richard
Enter RATCLIFF
My lord
Zounds who is there
Ratcliff my lord tis I The early villagecock
Hath twice done salutation to the morn
Your friends are up and buckle on their armour
O Ratcliff I have dreamd a fearful dream
What thinkest thou will our friends prove all true
No doubt my lord
O Ratcliff I fear I fear
Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows
By the apostle Paul shadows tonight
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond
It is not yet near day Come go with me
Under our tents Ill play the eavesdropper
To see if any mean to shrink from me
Exeunt
Enter the Lords to RICHMOND sitting in his tent
Good morrow Richmond
Cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen
That you have taen a tardy sluggard here
How have you slept my lord
The sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams
That ever enterd in a drowsy head
Have I since your departure had my lords
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murderd
Came to my tent and cried on victory
I promise you my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream
How far into the morning is it lords
Upon the stroke of four
Why then tis time to arm and give direction
His oration to his soldiers
More than I have said loving countrymen
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon yet remember this
God and our good cause fight upon our side
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
Like highreard bulwarks stand before our faces
Richard except those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow
For what is he they follow  truly gentlemen
A bloody tyrant and a homicide
One raised in blood and one in blood establishd
One that made means to come by what he hath
And slaughterd those that were the means to help him
Abase foul stone made precious by the foil
Of Englands chair where he is falsely set
One that hath ever been Gods enemy
Then if you fight against Gods enemy
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down
You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
If you do fight against your countrys foes
Your countrys fat shall pay your pains the hire
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
If you do free your children from the sword
Your childrens children quit it in your age
Then in the name of God and all these rights
Advance your standards draw your willing swords
For me the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earths cold face
But if I thrive the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully
God and Saint George Richmond and victory
Exeunt
Reenter KING RICHARD RATCLIFF Attendants and Forces
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond
That he was never trained up in arms
He said the truth and what said Surrey then
He smiled and said The better for our purpose
He was in the right and so indeed it is
Clock striketh
Ten the clock there Give me a calendar
Who saw the sun today
Not I my lord
Then he disdains to shine for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago
A black day will it be to somebody Ratcliff
My lord
The sun will not be seen today
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army
I would these dewy tears were from the ground
Not shine today Why what is that to me
More than to Richmond  for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him
Enter NORFOLK
Arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field
Come bustle bustle caparison my horse
Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
And thus my battle shall be ordered
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length
Consisting equally of horse and foot
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse
They thus directed we will follow
In the main battle whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
This and Saint George to boot What thinkst thou Norfolk
A good direction warlike sovereign
This found I on my tent this morning
He sheweth him a paper
Reads
Jockey of Norfolk be not too bold
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold
A thing devised by the enemy
Go gentleman every man unto his charge
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
Conscience is but a word that cowards use
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe
Our strong arms be our conscience swords our law
March on join bravely let us tot pellmell
If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell
His oration to his Army
What shall I say more than I have inferrd
Remember whom you are to cope withal
A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways
A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants
Whom their oercloyed country vomits forth
To desperate ventures and assured destruction
You sleeping safe they bring to you unrest
You having lands and blest with beauteous wives
They would restrain the one distain the other
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
Long kept in Bretagne at our mothers cost
A milksop one that never in his life
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
Lets whip these stragglers oer the seas again
Lash hence these overweening rags of France
These famishd beggars weary of their lives
Who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
For want of means poor rats had hangd themselves
If we be conquerd let men conquer us
And not these bastard Bretons whom our fathers
Have in their own land beaten bobbd and thumpd
And in record left them the heirs of shame
Shall these enjoy our lands  lie with our wives
Ravish our daughters
Drum afar off
Hark I hear their drum
Fight gentlemen of England fight bold yoemen
Draw archers draw your arrows to the head
Spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves
Enter a Messenger
What says Lord Stanley will he bring his power
My lord he doth deny to come
Off with his son Georges head
My lord the enemy is past the marsh
After the battle let George Stanley die

Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
Upon them victory sits on our helms
Exeunt

The day is ours the bloody dog is dead
Courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee
Lo here this longusurped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluckd off to grace thy brows withal
Wear it enjoy it and make much of it
Great God of heaven say Amen to all
But tell me is young George Stanley living
He is my lord and safe in Leicester town
Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us
What men of name are slain on either side
John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers
Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon
Inter their bodies as becomes their births
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us
And then as we have taen the sacrament
We will unite the white rose and the red
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
That long have frownd upon their enmity
What traitor hears me and says not amen
England hath long been mad and scarrd herself
The brother blindly shed the brothers blood
The father rashly slaughterd his own son
The son compelld been butcher to the sire
All this divided York and Lancaster
Divided in their dire division
O now let Richmond and Elizabeth
The true succeeders of each royal house
By Gods fair ordinance conjoin together
And let their heirs God if thy will be so
Enrich the time to come with smoothfaced peace
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord
That would reduce these bloody days again
And make poor England weep in streams of blood
Let them not live to taste this lands increase
That would with treason wound this fair lands peace
Now civil wounds are stoppd peace lives again
That she may long live here God say amen
Exeunt
PROLOGUE
Two households both alike in dignity
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of starcrossd lovers take their life
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents strife
The fearful passage of their deathmarkd love
And the continuance of their parents rage
Which but their childrens end nought could remove
Is now the two hours traffic of our stage
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY of the house of Capulet armed with swords and bucklers
Gregory o my word well not carry coals
No for then we should be colliers
I mean an we be in choler well draw
Ay while you live draw your neck out o the collar
I strike quickly being moved
But thou art not quickly moved to strike
A dog of the house of Montague moves me
To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand
therefore if thou art moved thou runnst away
A dog of that house shall move me to stand I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montagues
That shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes
to the wall
True and therefore women being the weaker vessels
are ever thrust to the wall therefore I will push
Montagues men from the wall and thrust his maids

have fought with the men I will be cruel with the
maids and cut off their heads
The heads of the maids

Thou villain CapuletHold me not let me go
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe
Enter PRINCE with Attendants
Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
Profaners of this neighbourstained steel
Will they not hear What ho you men you beasts
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins
On pain of torture from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
By thee old Capulet and Montague
Have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets
And made Veronas ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
To wield old partisans in hands as old
Cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate
If ever you disturb our streets again
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
For this time all the rest depart away
You Capulet shall go along with me
And Montague come you this afternoon
To know our further pleasure in this case
To old Freetown our common judgmentplace
Once more on pain of death all men depart
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE LADY MONTAGUE and BENVOLIO
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
Speak nephew were you by when it began
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours close fighting ere I did approach
I drew to part them in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared
Which as he breathed defiance to my ears
He swung about his head and cut the winds
Who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more and fought on part and part
Till the prince came who parted either part
O where is Romeo saw you him today
Right glad I am he was not at this fray
Madam an hour before the worshippd sun
Peerd forth the golden window of the east
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the citys side
So early walking did I see your son
Towards him I made but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood
I measuring his affections by my own
That most are busied when theyre most alone
Pursued my humour not pursuing his
And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me
Many a morning hath he there been seen
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
But all so soon as the allcheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Auroras bed
Away from the light steals home my heavy son
And private in his chamber pens himself
Shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night
Black and portentous must this humour prove
Unless good counsel may the cause remove
My noble uncle do you know the cause
I neither know it nor can learn of him
Have you importuned him by any means
Both by myself and many other friends
But he his own affections counsellor
Is to himselfI will not say how true
But to himself so secret and so close
So far from sounding and discovery
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
We would as willingly give cure as know
Enter ROMEO
See where he comes so please you step aside
Ill know his grievance or be much denied
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift Come madam lets away
Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
Goodmorrow cousin
Is the day so young
But new struck nine
Ay me sad hours seem long
Was that my father that went hence so fast
It was What sadness lengthens Romeos hours
Not having that which having makes them short
In love
Out
Of love
Out of her favour where I am in love
Alas that love so gentle in his view
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
Alas that love whose view is muffled still
Should without eyes see pathways to his will
Where shall we dine O me What fray was here
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
Heres much to do with hate but more with love
Why then O brawling love O loving hate
O any thing of nothing first create
O heavy lightness serious vanity
Misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire
sick health
Stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
This love feel I that feel no love in this
Dost thou not laugh
No coz I rather weep
Good heart at what
At thy good hearts oppression
Why such is loves transgression
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
Being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
Being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
What is it else a madness most discreet
A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz
Soft I will go along
An if you leave me so you do me wrong
Tut I have lost myself I am not here
This is not Romeo hes some other where
Tell me in sadness who is that you love
What shall I groan and tell thee
Groan why no
But sadly tell me who
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
Ah word ill urged to one that is so ill
In sadness cousin I do love a woman
I aimd so near when I supposed you loved
A right good markman And shes fair I love
A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
Well in that hit you miss shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow she hath Dians wit
And in strong proof of chastity well armd
From loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
Nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
O she is rich in beauty only poor
That when she dies with beauty dies her store
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair
To merit bliss by making me despair
She hath forsworn to love and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now
Be ruled by me forget to think of her
O teach me how I should forget to think
By giving liberty unto thine eyes
Examine other beauties
Tis the way
To call hers exquisite in question more
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
Show me a mistress that is passing fair
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who passd that passing fair
Farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
Ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt
Exeunt
Enter CAPULET PARIS and Servant
But Montague is bound as well as I
In penalty alike and tis not hard I think
For men so old as we to keep the peace
Of honourable reckoning are you both
And pity tis you lived at odds so long
But now my lord what say you to my suit
But saying oer what I have said before
My child is yet a stranger in the world
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
Younger than she are happy mothers made
And too soon marrd are those so early made
The earth hath swallowd all my hopes but she
She is the hopeful lady of my earth
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
My will to her consent is but a part
An she agree within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice
This night I hold an old accustomd feast
Whereto I have invited many a guest
Such as I love and you among the store
One more most welcome makes my number more
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When wellapparelld April on the heel
Of limping winter treads even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house hear all all see
And like her most whose merit most shall be
Which on more view of many mine being one
May stand in number though in reckoning none
Come go with me
To Servant giving a paper
Go sirrah trudge about
Through fair Verona find those persons out
Whose names are written there and to them say
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay
Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
Find them out whose names are written here It is
written that the shoemaker should meddle with his

Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
Tut man one fire burns out anothers burning
One pain is lessend by anothers anguish
Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
One desperate grief cures with anothers languish
Take thou some new infection to thy eye
And the rank poison of the old will die
Your plaintainleaf is excellent for that
For what I pray thee
For your broken shin
Why Romeo art thou mad
Not mad but bound more than a madman is
Shut up in prison kept without my food
Whippd and tormented andGodden good fellow

Exit
At this same ancient feast of Capulets
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest
With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires
And these who often drownd could never die
Transparent heretics be burnt for liars
One fairer than my love the allseeing sun
Neer saw her match since first the world begun
Tut you saw her fair none else being by
Herself poised with herself in either eye
But in that crystal scales let there be weighd
Your ladys love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast
And she shall scant show well that now shows best
Ill go along no such sight to be shown
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own
Exeunt

I have rememberd me thous hear our counsel
Thou knowst my daughters of a pretty age
Faith I can tell her age unto an hour
Shes not fourteen
Ill lay fourteen of my teeth
And yet to my teeth be it spoken I have but four
She is not fourteen How long is it now
To Lammastide
A fortnight and odd days
Even or odd of all days in the year
Come Lammaseve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and sheGod rest all Christian souls
Were of an age well Susan is with God
She was too good for me but as I said
On Lammaseve at night shall she be fourteen
That shall she marry I remember it well
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years
And she was weandI never shall forget it
Of all the days of the year upon that day
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
My lord and you were then at Mantua
Nay I do bear a brainbut as I said
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
Shake quoth the dovehouse twas no need I trow
To bid me trudge
And since that time it is eleven years
For then she could stand alone nay by the rood
She could have run and waddled all about
For even the day before she broke her brow
And then my husbandGod be with his soul
A was a merry mantook up the child
Yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit
Wilt thou not Jule and by my holidame
The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay
To see now how a jest shall come about
I warrant an I should live a thousand years
I never should forget it Wilt thou not Jule quoth he
And pretty fool it stinted and said Ay
Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace
Yes madam yet I cannot choose but laugh
To think it should leave crying and say Ay
And yet I warrant it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerels stone
A parlous knock and it cried bitterly
Yea quoth my husbandfallst upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
Wilt thou not Jule it stinted and said Ay
And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I
Peace I have done God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that eer I nursed
An I might live to see thee married once
I have my wish
Marry that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of Tell me daughter Juliet
How stands your disposition to be married
It is an honour that I dream not of
An honour were not I thine only nurse
I would say thou hadst suckd wisdom from thy teat
Well think of marriage now younger than you
Here in Verona ladies of esteem
Are made already mothers by my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid Thus then in brief
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
A man young lady lady such a man
As all the worldwhy hes a man of wax
Veronas summer hath not such a flower
Nay hes a flower in faith a very flower
What say you can you love the gentleman
This night you shall behold him at our feast
Read oer the volume of young Paris face
And find delight writ there with beautys pen
Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes
This precious book of love this unbound lover
To beautify him only lacks a cover
The fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide
That book in manys eyes doth share the glory
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story
So shall you share all that he doth possess
By having him making yourself no less
No less nay bigger women grow by men
Speak briefly can you like of Paris love
Ill look to like if looking liking move
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly
Enter a Servant
Madam the guests are come supper served up you

Exeunt
Enter ROMEO MERCUTIO BENVOLIO with five or six Maskers Torchbearers and others
What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without a apology
The date is out of such prolixity
Well have no Cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
Bearing a Tartars painted bow of lath
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
Nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
After the prompter for our entrance
But let them measure us by what they will
Well measure them a measure and be gone
Give me a torch I am not for this ambling
Being but heavy I will bear the light
Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance
Not I believe me you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move
You are a lover borrow Cupids wings
And soar with them above a common bound
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Under loves heavy burden do I sink
And to sink in it should you burden love
Too great oppression for a tender thing
Is love a tender thing it is too rough
Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
If love be rough with you be rough with love
Prick love for pricking and you beat love down
Give me a case to put my visage in
A visor for a visor what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
Come knock and enter and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs
A torch for me let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
For I am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
Ill be a candleholder and look on
The game was neer so fair and I am done
Tut duns the mouse the constables own word
If thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
Of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst
Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho
Nay thats not so
I mean sir in delay
We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits
And we mean well in going to this mask
But tis no wit to go
Why may one ask
I dreamd a dream tonight
And so did I
Well what was yours
That dreamers often lie
In bed asleep while they do dream things true
O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
She is the fairies midwife and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agatestone
On the forefinger of an alderman
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
Her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers
The traces of the smallest spiders web
The collars of the moonshines watery beams
Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
Her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
Not so big as a round little worm
Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers brains and then they dream of love
Oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight
Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
Oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
Then dreams he of another benefice
Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades
Of healths fivefathom deep and then anon
Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
This is the hag when maids lie on their backs
That presses them and learns them first to bear
Making them women of good carriage
This is she
Peace peace Mercutio peace
Thou talkst of nothing
True I talk of dreams
Which are the children of an idle brain
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north
And being angerd puffs away from thence
Turning his face to the dewdropping south
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late
I fear too early for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this nights revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death
But He that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my sail On lusty gentlemen
Strike drum
Exeunt
Musicians waiting Enter Servingmen with napkins
Wheres Potpan that he helps not to take away He
shift a trencher he scrape a trencher
When good manners shall lie all in one or two mens
hands and they unwashed too tis a foul thing

courtcupboard look to the plate Good thou save

the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell
Antony and Potpan

Enter CAPULET with JULIET and others of his house meeting the Guests and Maskers
Welcome gentlemen ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you
Ah ha my mistresses which of you all
Will now deny to dance she that makes dainty
She Ill swear hath corns am I come near ye now
Welcome gentlemen I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair ladys ear
Such as would please tis gone tis gone tis gone
You are welcome gentlemen come musicians play
A hall a hall give room and foot it girls
Music plays and they dance
More light you knaves and turn the tables up
And quench the fire the room is grown too hot
Ah sirrah this unlookdfor sport comes well
Nay sit nay sit good cousin Capulet
For you and I are past our dancing days
How long ist now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask
Byr lady thirty years
What man tis not so much tis not so much
Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio
Come pentecost as quickly as it will
Some five and twenty years and then we maskd
Tis more tis more his son is elder sir
His son is thirty
Will you tell me that
His son was but a ward two years ago
To a Servingman  What lady is that which doth
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight
I know not sir
O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiopes ear
Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady oer her fellows shows
The measure done Ill watch her place of stand
And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
Did my heart love till now forswear it sight
For I neer saw true beauty till this night
This by his voice should be a Montague
Fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave
Come hither coverd with an antic face
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Now by the stock and honour of my kin
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin
Why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so
Uncle this is a Montague our foe
A villain that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night
Young Romeo is it
Tis he that villain Romeo
Content thee gentle coz let him alone
He bears him like a portly gentleman
And to say truth Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and wellgovernd youth
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient take no note of him
It is my will the which if thou respect
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns
And illbeseeming semblance for a feast
It fits when such a villain is a guest
Ill not endure him
He shall be endured
What goodman boy I say he shall go to
Am I the master here or you go to
Youll not endure him God shall mend my soul
Youll make a mutiny among my guests
You will set cockahoop youll be the man
Why uncle tis a shame
Go to go to
You are a saucy boy ist so indeed
This trick may chance to scathe you I know what
You must contrary me marry tis time
Well said my hearts You are a princox go
Be quiet orMore light more light For shame
Ill make you quiet What cheerly my hearts
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
I will withdraw but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
Exit
To JULIET  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine the gentle fine is this
My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
Which mannerly devotion shows in this
For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
Saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
Then move not while my prayers effect I take
Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
Then have my lips the sin that they have took
Sin from thy lips O trespass sweetly urged
Give me my sin again
You kiss by the book
Madam your mother craves a word with you
What is her mother
Marry bachelor
Her mother is the lady of the house
And a good lady and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter that you talkd withal
I tell you he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks
Is she a Capulet
O dear account my life is my foes debt
Away begone the sport is at the best
Ay so I fear the more is my unrest
Nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards
Is it een so why then I thank you all
I thank you honest gentlemen good night
More torches here Come on then lets to bed
Ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late
Ill to my rest
Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
Come hither nurse What is yond gentleman
The son and heir of old Tiberio
Whats he that now is going out of door
Marry that I think be young Petrucio
Whats he that follows there that would not dance
I know not
Go ask his name if he be married
My grave is like to be my wedding bed
His name is Romeo and a Montague
The only son of your great enemy
My only love sprung from my only hate
Too early seen unknown and known too late
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
That I must love a loathed enemy
Whats this whats this
A rhyme I learnd even now
Of one I danced withal
One calls within Juliet
Anon anon
Come lets away the strangers all are gone
Exeunt
PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
And young affection gapes to be his heir
That fair for which love groand for and would die
With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks
But to his foe supposed he must complain
And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
Being held a foe he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
And she as much in love her means much less
To meet her newbeloved any where
But passion lends them power time means to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet
Exit
Enter ROMEO
Can I go forward when my heart is here
Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
He climbs the wall and leaps down within it
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
Romeo my cousin Romeo
He is wise
And on my lie hath stoln him home to bed
He ran this way and leapd this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio
Nay Ill conjure too
Romeo humours madman passion lover
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Cry but Ay me pronounce but love and dove
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
One nickname for her purblind son and heir
Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua loved the beggarmaid
He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
The ape is dead and I must conjure him
I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip
By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
That in thy likeness thou appear to us
And if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
This cannot anger him twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress circle
Of some strange nature letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down
That were some spite my invocation
Is fair and honest and in his mistres s name
I conjure only but to raise up him
Come he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night
Blind is his love and best befits the dark
If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
Now will he sit under a medlar tree
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
Romeo that she were O that she were
An open et caetera thou a poperin pear
Romeo good night Ill to my trucklebed
This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
Come shall we go
Go then for tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found
Exeunt
Enter ROMEO
He jests at scars that never felt a wound
JULIET appears above at a window
But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing what of that
Her eye discourses I will answer it
I am too bold tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
Having some business do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand
That I might touch that cheek
Ay me
She speaks
O speak again bright angel for thou art
As glorious to this night being oer my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air
O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet
Aside  Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this
Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Thou art thyself though not a Montague
Whats Montague it is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man O be some other name
Whats in a name that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet
So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title Romeo doff thy name
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself
I take thee at thy word
Call me but love and Ill be new baptized
Henceforth I never will be Romeo
What man art thou that thus bescreend in night
So stumblest on my counsel
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am
My name dear saint is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee
Had I it written I would tear the word
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongues utterance yet I know the sound
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague
Neither fair saint if either thee dislike
How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
And the place death considering who thou art
If any of my kinsmen find thee here
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls
For stony limits cannot hold love out
And what love can do that dares love attempt
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
If they do see thee they will murder thee
Alack there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity
I would not for the world they saw thee here
I have nights cloak to hide me from their sight
And but thou love me let them find me here
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued wanting of thy love
By whose direction foundst thou out this place
By love who first did prompt me to inquire
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washd with the farthest sea
I would adventure for such merchandise
Thou knowst the mask of night is on my face
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
What I have spoke but farewell compliment
Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay
And I will take thy word yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
Then say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
Or if thou thinkst I am too quickly won
Ill frown and be perverse an say thee nay
So thou wilt woo but else not for the world
In truth fair Montague I am too fond
And therefore thou mayst think my havior light
But trust me gentleman Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange
I should have been more strange I must confess
But that thou overheardst ere I was ware
My true loves passion therefore pardon me
And not impute this yielding to light love
Which the dark night hath so discovered
Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruittree tops
O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
That monthly changes in her circled orb
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable
What shall I swear by
Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
Which is the god of my idolatry
And Ill believe thee
If my hearts dear love
Well do not swear although I joy in thee
It is too rash too unadvised too sudden
Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens Sweet good night
This bud of love by summers ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
Good night good night as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
The exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
And yet I would it were to give again
Wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love
But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea
My love as deep the more I give to thee
The more I have for both are infinite
Nurse calls within
I hear some noise within dear love adieu
Anon good nurse Sweet Montague be true
Stay but a little I will come again
Exit above
O blessed blessed night I am afeard
Being in night all this is but a dream
Too flatteringsweet to be substantial
Reenter JULIET above
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
If that thy bent of love be honourable
Thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world
Within  Madam
I come anonBut if thou meanst not well
I do beseech thee
Within  Madam
By and by I come
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
Tomorrow will I send
So thrive my soul
A thousand times good night
Exit above
A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from
their books
But love from love toward school with heavy looks
Retiring
Reenter JULIET above
Hist Romeo hist O for a falconers voice
To lure this tasselgentle back again
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeos name
It is my soul that calls upon my name
How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
Like softest music to attending ears
Romeo
My dear
At what oclock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee
At the hour of nine
I will not fail tis twenty years till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back
Let me stand here till thou remember it
I shall forget to have thee still stand there
Remembering how I love thy company
And Ill still stay to have thee still forget
Forgetting any other home but this
Tis almost morning I would have thee gone
And yet no further than a wantons bird
Who lets it hop a little from her hand
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
And with a silk thread plucks it back again
So lovingjealous of his liberty
I would I were thy bird
Sweet so would I
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
Good night good night parting is such
sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow
Exit above
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
Hence will I to my ghostly fathers cell
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
Exit
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE with a basket
The greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth days path and Titans fiery wheels
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye
The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
The earth thats natures mother is her tomb
What is her burying grave that is her womb
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find
Many for many virtues excellent
None but for some and yet all different
O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs plants stones and their true qualities
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give
Nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power
For this being smelt with that part cheers each part
Being tasted slays all senses with the heart
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs grace and rude will
And where the worser is predominant
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
Enter ROMEO
Good morrow father
Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distemperd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
And where care lodges sleep will never lie
But where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uproused by some distemperature
Or if not so then here I hit it right
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight
That last is true the sweeter rest was mine
God pardon sin wast thou with Rosaline
With Rosaline my ghostly father no
I have forgot that name and that names woe
Thats my good son but where hast thou been then
Ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
I have been feasting with mine enemy
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Thats by me wounded both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
My intercession likewise steads my foe
Be plain good son and homely in thy drift
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
As mine on hers so hers is set on mine
And all combined save what thou must combine
By holy marriage when and where and how
We met we wood and made exchange of vow
Ill tell thee as we pass but this I pray
That thou consent to marry us today
Holy Saint Francis what a change is here
Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
So soon forsaken young mens love then lies
Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
Jesu Maria what a deal of brine
Hath washd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
How much salt water thrown away in waste
To season love that of it doth not taste
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not washd off yet
If eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
And art thou changed pronounce this sentence then
Women may fall when theres no strength in men
Thou chidst me oft for loving Rosaline
For doting not for loving pupil mine
And badst me bury love
Not in a grave
To lay one in another out to have
I pray thee chide not she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
The other did not so
O she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell
But come young waverer come go with me
In one respect Ill thy assistant be
For this alliance may so happy prove
To turn your households rancour to pure love
O let us hence I stand on sudden haste
Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
Exeunt
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
Where the devil should this Romeo be
Came he not home tonight
Not to his fathers I spoke with his man
Ah that same pale hardhearted wench that Rosaline
Torments him so that he will sure run mad
Tybalt the kinsman of old Capulet
Hath sent a letter to his fathers house
A challenge on my life
Romeo will answer it
Any man that can write may answer a letter
Nay he will answer the letters master how he
dares being dared
Alas poor Romeo he is already dead stabbed with a
white wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a
lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bowboys buttshaft and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt
Why what is Tybalt
More than prince of cats I can tell you O he is
the courageous captain of compliments He fights as
you sing pricksong keeps time distance and
proportion rests me his minim rest one two and

Romeo bon jour theres a French salutation
to your French slop You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night
Good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you
The ship sir the slip can you not conceive
Pardon good Mercutio my business was great and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
Thats as much as to say such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams
Meaning to courtsy
Thou hast most kindly hit it
A most courteous exposition
Nay I am the very pink of courtesy
Pink for flower
Right
Why then is my pump well flowered
Well said follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it
is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular
O singlesoled jest solely singular for the
singleness
Come between us good Benvolio my wits faint
Switch and spurs switch and spurs or Ill cry a match
Nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase I have
done for thou hast more of the wildgoose in one of
thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five
was I with you there for the goose
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest
Nay good goose bite not
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most
sharp sauce
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose
O heres a wit of cheveril that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad
I stretch it out for that word broad which added
to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
Why is not this better now than groaning for love
now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art
thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
for this drivelling love is like a great natural
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
Stop there stop there
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
O thou art deceived I would have made it short
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale and
meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer

good quarrel and the law on my side
Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about

out what she bade me say I will keep to myself
but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her into
a fools paradise as they say it were a very gross
kind of behavior as they say for the gentlewoman

with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing
Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress I

And there she shall at Friar Laurence cell
Be shrived and married Here is for thy pains

This afternoon sir well she shall be there
And stay good nurse behind the abbey wall
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair

Must be my convoy in the secret night
Farewell be trusty and Ill quit thy pains
Farewell commend me to thy mistress

The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse
In half an hour she promised to return
Perchance she cannot meet him thats not so
O she is lame loves heralds should be thoughts
Which ten times faster glide than the suns beams
Driving back shadows over louring hills
Therefore do nimblepiniond doves draw love
And therefore hath the windswift Cupid wings
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this days journey and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours yet she is not come
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball
My words would bandy her to my sweet love
And his to me
But old folks many feign as they were dead
Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
O God she comes
Enter Nurse and PETER
O honey nurse what news
Hast thou met with him Send thy man away

Exit PETER
Now good sweet nurseO Lord why lookst thou sad
Though news be sad yet tell them merrily
If good thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face
I am aweary give me leave awhile
Fie how my bones ache what a jaunt have I had
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
Nay come I pray thee speak good good nurse speak
Jesu what haste can you not stay awhile
Do you not see that I am out of breath
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
Is thy news good or bad answer to that
Say either and Ill stay the circumstance
Let me be satisfied ist good or bad
Well you have made a simple choice you know not
how to choose a man Romeo no not he though his
face be better than any mans yet his leg excels
all mens and for a hand and a foot and a body
though they be not to be talked on yet they are
past compare he is not the flower of courtesy
but Ill warrant him as gentle as a lamb Go thy
ways wench serve God What have you dined at home
No no but all this did I know before
What says he of our marriage what of that
Lord how my head aches what a head have I
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
My back o t other sideO my back my back
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jaunting up and down

Sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
Your love says like an honest gentleman and a
courteous and a kind and a handsome and I

Where is my mother why she is within
Where should she be How oddly thou repliest
Your love says like an honest gentleman

Is this the poultice for my aching bones
Henceforward do your messages yourself
Heres such a coil come what says Romeo
Have you got leave to go to shrift today

Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence cell
There stays a husband to make you a wife
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
Theyll be in scarlet straight at any news
Hie you to church I must another way
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
Must climb a birds nest soon when it is dark
I am the drudge and toil in your delight
But you shall bear the burden soon at night
Go Ill to dinner hie you to the cell
Hie to high fortune Honest nurse farewell

That after hours with sorrow chide us not
Amen amen but come what sorrow can
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight
Do thou but close our hands with holy words
Then lovedevouring death do what he dare
It is enough I may but call her mine
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die like fire and powder
Which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite
Therefore love moderately long love doth so
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

Here comes the lady O so light a foot
Will neer wear out the everlasting flint

As much to him else is his thanks too much
Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
Be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air and let rich musics tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter
Conceit more rich in matter than in words
Brags of his substance not of ornament
They are but beggars that can count their worth
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
Come come with me and we will make short work
For by your leaves you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one

enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says God send me no need of

other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter with another for
tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling

Which way ran he that killd Mercutio
Tybalt that murderer which way ran he
There lies that Tybalt
Up sir go with me
I charge thee in the princes name obey
Enter Prince attended MONTAGUE CAPULET their Wives and others
Where are the vile beginners of this fray
O noble prince I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
There lies the man slain by young Romeo
That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio
Tybalt my cousin O my brothers child
O prince O cousin husband O the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
O cousin cousin
Benvolio who began this bloody fray
Tybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did slay
Romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was and urged withal
Your high displeasure all this uttered
With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast
Who all as hot turns deadly point to point
And with a martial scorn with one hand beats
Cold death aside and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt whose dexterity
Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
Hold friends friends part and swifter than
his tongue
His agile arm beats down their fatal points
And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
But by and by comes back to Romeo
Who had but newly entertaind revenge
And to t they go like lightning for ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
This is the truth or let Benvolio die
He is a kinsman to the Montague
Affection makes him false he speaks not true
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
And all those twenty could but kill one life
I beg for justice which thou prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live
Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
Not Romeo prince he was Mercutios friend
His fault concludes but what the law should end
The life of Tybalt
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence
I have an interest in your hates proceeding
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
Therefore use none let Romeo hence in haste
Else when hes found that hour is his last
Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
Exeunt
Enter JULIET
Gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
Towards Phoebus lodging such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately
Spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
That runaways eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties or if love be blind
It best agrees with night Come civil night
Thou sobersuited matron all in black
And learn me how to lose a winning match
Playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
Hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks
With thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
Come night come Romeo come thou day in night
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a ravens back
Come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night
Give me my Romeo and when he shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love
But not possessd it and though I am sold
Not yet enjoyd so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them O here comes my nurse
And she brings news and every tongue that speaks
But Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence
Enter Nurse with cords
Now nurse what news What hast thou there the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch
Ay ay the cords
Throws them down
Ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands
Ah welladay hes dead hes dead hes dead
We are undone lady we are undone
Alack the day hes gone hes killd hes dead
Can heaven be so envious
Romeo can
Though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo
Who ever would have thought it Romeo
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
This torture should be roard in dismal hell
Hath Romeo slain himself say thou but I
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice
I am not I if there be such an I
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I
If he be slain say I or if not no
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes
God save the markhere on his manly breast
A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
Pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
All in goreblood I swounded at the sight
O break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
To prison eyes neer look on liberty
Vile earth to earth resign end motion here
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier
O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
That ever I should live to see thee dead
What storm is this that blows so contrary
Is Romeo slaughterd and is Tybalt dead
My dearloved cousin and my dearer lord
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
For who is living if those two are gone
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
Romeo that killd him he is banished
O God did Romeos hand shed Tybalts blood
It did it did alas the day it did
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
Beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
Dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
Despised substance of divinest show
Just opposite to what thou justly seemst
A damned saint an honourable villain
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace
Theres no trust
No faith no honesty in men all perjured
All forsworn all naught all dissemblers
Ah wheres my man give me some aqua vitae
These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
Shame come to Romeo
Blisterd be thy tongue
For such a wish he was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
For tis a throne where honour may be crownd
Sole monarch of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to chide at him
Will you speak well of him that killd your cousin
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
When I thy threehours wife have mangled it
But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have killd my husband
Back foolish tears back to your native spring
Your tributary drops belong to woe
Which you mistaking offer up to joy
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
And Tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
All this is comfort wherefore weep I then
Some word there was worser than Tybalts death
That murderd me I would forget it fain
But O it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeobanished
That banished that one word banished
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts death
Was woe enough if it had ended there
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rankd with other griefs
Why followd not when she said Tybalts dead
Thy father or thy mother nay or both
Which modern lamentations might have moved
But with a rearward following Tybalts death
Romeo is banished to speak that word
Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
All slain all dead Romeo is banished
There is no end no limit measure bound
In that words death no words can that woe sound
Where is my father and my mother nurse
Weeping and wailing over Tybalts corse
Will you go to them I will bring you thither
Wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent
When theirs are dry for Romeos banishment
Take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled
Both you and I for Romeo is exiled
He made you for a highway to my bed
But I a maid die maidenwidowed
Come cords come nurse Ill to my weddingbed
And death not Romeo take my maidenhead
Hie to your chamber Ill find Romeo
To comfort you I wot well where he is
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
Ill to him he is hid at Laurence cell
O find him give this ring to my true knight
And bid him come to take his last farewell
Exeunt
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
Affliction is enamourd of thy parts
And thou art wedded to calamity
Enter ROMEO
Father what news what is the princes doom
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
That I yet know not
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company
I bring thee tidings of the princes doom
What less than doomsday is the princes doom
A gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
Not bodys death but bodys banishment
Ha banishment be merciful say death
For exile hath more terror in his look
Much more than death do not say banishment
Hence from Verona art thou banished
Be patient for the world is broad and wide
There is no world without Verona walls
But purgatory torture hell itself
Hencebanished is banishd from the world
And worlds exile is death then banished
Is death mistermd calling death banishment
Thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me
O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness
Thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
Taking thy part hath rushd aside the law
And turnd that black word death to banishment
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not
Tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog
And little mouse every unworthy thing
Live here in heaven and may look on her
But Romeo may not more validity
More honourable state more courtship lives
In carrionflies than Romeo they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliets hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips
Who even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
But Romeo may not he is banished
Flies may do this but I from this must fly
They are free men but I am banished
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death
Hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
No sudden mean of death though neer so mean
But banished to kill mebanished
O friar the damned use that word in hell
Howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
Being a divine a ghostly confessor
A sinabsolver and my friend professd
To mangle me with that word banished
Thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word
O thou wilt speak again of banishment
Ill give thee armour to keep off that word
Adversitys sweet milk philosophy
To comfort thee though thou art banished
Yet banished Hang up philosophy
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet
Displant a town reverse a princes doom
It helps not it prevails not talk no more
O then I see that madmen have no ears
How should they when that wise men have no eyes
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love
An hour but married Tybalt murdered
Doting like me and like me banished
Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
And fall upon the ground as I do now
Taking the measure of an unmade grave
Knocking within
Arise one knocks good Romeo hide thyself
Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans
Mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
Knocking
Hark how they knock Whos there Romeo arise
Thou wilt be taken Stay awhile Stand up
Knocking
Run to my study By and by Gods will
What simpleness is this I come I come
Knocking
Who knocks so hard whence come you whats your will
Within  Let me come in and you shall know
my errand
I come from Lady Juliet
Welcome then
Enter Nurse
O holy friar O tell me holy friar
Where is my ladys lord wheres Romeo
There on the ground with his own tears made drunk
O he is even in my mistress case
Just in her case O woful sympathy
Piteous predicament Even so lies she
Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Stand up stand up stand and you be a man
For Juliets sake for her sake rise and stand
Why should you fall into so deep an O
Nurse
Ah sir ah sir Well deaths the end of all
Spakest thou of Juliet how is it with her
Doth she not think me an old murderer
Now I have staind the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own
Where is she and how doth she and what says
My conceald lady to our cancelld love
O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
And now falls on her bed and then starts up
And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
And then down falls again
As if that name
Shot from the deadly level of a gun
Did murder her as that names cursed hand
Murderd her kinsman O tell me friar tell me
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge tell me that I may sack
The hateful mansion
Drawing his sword
Hold thy desperate hand
Art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
The unreasonable fury of a beast
Unseemly woman in a seeming man
Or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
Thou hast amazed me by my holy order
I thought thy disposition better temperd
Hast thou slain Tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee
By doing damned hate upon thyself
Why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
Which like a usurer aboundst in all
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
Digressing from the valour of a man
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
Thy wit that ornament to shape and love
Misshapen in the conduct of them both
Like powder in a skitless soldiers flask
Is set afire by thine own ignorance
And thou dismemberd with thine own defence
What rouse thee man thy Juliet is alive
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
But thou slewst Tybalt there are thou happy too
The law that threatend death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile there art thou happy
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back
Happiness courts thee in her best array
But like a misbehaved and sullen wench
Thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
Take heed take heed for such die miserable
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
But look thou stay not till the watch be set
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
Beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou wentst forth in lamentation
Go before nurse commend me to thy lady
And bid her hasten all the house to bed
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could have stayd here all the night
To hear good counsel O what learning is
My lord Ill tell my lady you will come
Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late
Exit
How well my comfort is revived by this
Go hence good night and here stands all your state
Either be gone before the watch be set
Or by the break of day disguised from hence
Sojourn in Mantua Ill find out your man
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here
Give me thy hand tis late farewell good night
But that a joy past joy calls out on me
It were a grief so brief to part with thee Farewell
Exeunt

Good night
Exeunt
Enter ROMEO and JULIET above at the window
Wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
It was the nightingale and not the lark
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranatetree
Believe me love it was the nightingale
It was the lark the herald of the morn
No nightingale look love what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
Nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I must be gone and live or stay and die
Yon light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone
Let me be taen let me be put to death
I am content so thou wilt have it so
Ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye
Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthias brow
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
How ist my soul lets talk it is not day
It is it is hie hence be gone away
It is the lark that sings so out of tune
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division
This doth not so for she divideth us
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
O now I would they had changed voices too
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
Hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
O now be gone more light and light it grows
More light and light more dark and dark our woes
Enter Nurse to the chamber
Madam
Nurse
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
The day is broke be wary look about
Exit
Then window let day in and let life out
Farewell farewell one kiss and Ill descend
He goeth down
Art thou gone so love lord ay husband friend
I must hear from thee every day in the hour
For in a minute there are many days
O by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo
Farewell
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings love to thee
O thinkst thou we shall ever meet again
I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come
O God I have an illdivining soul
Methinks I see thee now thou art below
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight fails or thou lookst pale
And trust me love in my eye so do you
Dry sorrow drinks our blood Adieu adieu
Exit
O fortune fortune all men call thee fickle
If thou art fickle what dost thou with him
That is renownd for faith Be fickle fortune
For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back
Within         Ho daughter are you up
Who ist that calls is it my lady mother
Is she not down so late or up so early
What unaccustomd cause procures her hither
Enter LADY CAPULET
Why how now Juliet
Madam I am not well
Evermore weeping for your cousins death
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
Therefore have done some grief shows much of love
But much of grief shows still some want of wit
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
So shall you feel the loss but not the friend
Which you weep for
Feeling so the loss
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend
Well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughterd him
What villain madam
That same villain Romeo
Aside  Villain and he be many miles asunder
God Pardon him I do with all my heart
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
That is because the traitor murderer lives
Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Would none but I might venge my cousins death
We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
Then weep no more Ill send to one in Mantua
Where that same banishd runagate doth live
Shall give him such an unaccustomd dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold himdead
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexd
Madam if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison I would temper it
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof
Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
To hear him named and cannot come to him
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughterd him
Find thou the means and Ill find such a man
But now Ill tell thee joyful tidings girl
And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they I beseech your ladyship
Well well thou hast a careful father child
One who to put thee from thy heaviness
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
That thou expectst not nor I lookd not for
Madam in happy time what day is that
Marry my child early next Thursday morn
The gallant young and noble gentleman
The County Paris at Saint Peters Church
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
Now by Saint Peters Church and Peter too
He shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam
I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
Rather than Paris These are news indeed
Here comes your father tell him so yourself
And see how he will take it at your hands
Enter CAPULET and Nurse
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
But for the sunset of my brothers son
It rains downright
How now a conduit girl what still in tears
Evermore showering In one little body
Thou counterfeitst a bark a sea a wind
For still thy eyes which I may call the sea
Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
Who raging with thy tears and they with them
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempesttossed body How now wife
Have you deliverd to her our decree
Ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
I would the fool were married to her grave
Soft take me with you take me with you wife
How will she none doth she not give us thanks
Is she not proud doth she not count her blest
Unworthy as she is that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
Not proud you have but thankful that you have
Proud can I never be of what I hate
But thankful even for hate that is meant love
How now how now choplogic What is this
Proud and I thank you and I thank you not
And yet not proud mistress minion you
Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
But fettle your fine joints gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peters Church
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither
Out you greensickness carrion out you baggage
You tallowface
Fie fie what are you mad
Good father I beseech you on my knees
Hear me with patience but to speak a word
Hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
I tell thee what get thee to church o Thursday
Or never after look me in the face
Speak not reply not do not answer me
My fingers itch Wife we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child
But now I see this one is one too much
And that we have a curse in having her
Out on her hilding
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to rate her so
And why my lady wisdom hold your tongue
Good prudence smatter with your gossips go
I speak no treason
O God ye godden
May not one speak
Peace you mumbling fool
Utter your gravity oer a gossips bowl
For here we need it not
You are too hot
Gods bread it makes me mad
Day night hour tide time work play
Alone in company still my care hath been
To have her matchd and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage
Of fair demesnes youthful and nobly traind
Stuffd as they say with honourable parts
Proportiond as ones thought would wish a man
And then to have a wretched puling fool
A whining mammet in her fortunes tender
To answer Ill not wed I cannot love
I am too young I pray you pardon me
But as you will not wed Ill pardon you
Graze where you will you shall not house with me
Look tot think ont I do not use to jest
Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
An you be mine Ill give you to my friend
And you be not hang beg starve die in
the streets
For by my soul Ill neer acknowledge thee
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
Trust tot bethink you Ill not be forsworn
Exit
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
That sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother cast me not away
Delay this marriage for a month a week
Or if you do not make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
Talk not to me for Ill not speak a word
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee
Exit
O GodO nurse how shall this be prevented
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth comfort me counsel me
Upon so soft a subject as myself
What sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort nurse
Faith here it is
Romeo is banishd and all the world to nothing
That he dares neer come back to challenge you
Or if he do it needs must be by stealth
Then since the case so stands as now it doth
I think it best you married with the county
O hes a lovely gentleman
Romeos a dishclout to him an eagle madam
Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
As Paris hath Beshrew my very heart
I think you are happy in this second match
For it excels your first or if it did not
Your first is dead or twere as good he were
As living here and you no use of him
Speakest thou from thy heart
And from my soul too
Or else beshrew them both
Amen
What
Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone
Having displeased my father to Laurence cell
To make confession and to be absolved
Marry I will and this is wisely done
Exit
Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times Go counsellor
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
Ill to the friar to know his remedy
If all else fail myself have power to die
Exit
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
On Thursday sir the time is very short
My father Capulet will have it so
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste
You say you do not know the ladys mind
Uneven is the course I like it not
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death
And therefore have I little talkd of love
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
Now sir her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears
Which too much minded by herself alone
May be put from her by society
Now do you know the reason of this haste
Aside  I would I knew not why it should be slowd
Look sir here comes the lady towards my cell
Enter JULIET
Happily met my lady and my wife
That may be sir when I may be a wife
That may be must be love on Thursday next
What must be shall be
Thats a certain text
Come you to make confession to this father
To answer that I should confess to you
Do not deny to him that you love me
I will confess to you that I love him
So will ye I am sure that you love me
If I do so it will be of more price
Being spoke behind your back than to your face
Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
The tears have got small victory by that
For it was bad enough before their spite
Thou wrongst it more than tears with that report
That is no slander sir which is a truth
And what I spake I spake it to my face
Thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it
It may be so for it is not mine own
Are you at leisure holy father now
Or shall I come to you at evening mass
My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
My lord we must entreat the time alone
God shield I should disturb devotion
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
Exit
O shut the door and when thou hast done so
Come weep with me past hope past cure past help
Ah Juliet I already know thy grief
It strains me past the compass of my wits
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
On Thursday next be married to this county
Tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
Do thou but call my resolution wise
And with this knife Ill help it presently
God joind my heart and Romeos thou our hands
And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seald
Shall be the label to another deed
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another this shall slay them both
Therefore out of thy longexperienced time
Give me some present counsel or behold
Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring
Be not so long to speak I long to die
If what thou speakst speak not of remedy
Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent
If rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame
That copest with death himself to scape from it
And if thou darest Ill give thee remedy
O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
From off the battlements of yonder tower
Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
Or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse
Oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
Or bid me go into a newmade grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
Things that to hear them told have made me tremble
And I will do it without fear or doubt
To live an unstaind wife to my sweet love
Hold then go home be merry give consent
To marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
Take thou this vial being then in bed
And this distilled liquor drink thou off
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress but surcease
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
Like death when he shuts up the day of life
Each part deprived of supple government
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
And in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
Then as the manner of our country is
In thy best robes uncoverd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
In the mean time against thou shalt awake
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
And hither shall he come and he and I
Will watch thy waking and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
And this shall free thee from this present shame
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Give me give me O tell not me of fear
Hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
In this resolve Ill send a friar with speed
To Mantua with my letters to thy lord
Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear father
Exeunt

Enter JULIET
How now my headstrong where have you been gadding
Where I have learnd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests and am enjoind
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
And beg your pardon pardon I beseech you
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you
Send for the county go tell him of this
Ill have this knot knit up tomorrow morning
I met the youthful lord at Laurence cell
And gave him what becomed love I might
Not step oer the bounds of modesty
Why I am glad ont this is well stand up
This is ast should be Let me see the county
Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither
Now afore God this reverend holy friar

Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimd
Exeunt
Enter JULIET and Nurse
Ay those attires are best but gentle nurse

For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state
Which well thou knowst is cross and full of sin
Enter LADY CAPULET
What are you busy ho need you my help
No madam we have culld such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow
So please you let me now be left alone

For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business
Good night
Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life
Ill call them back again to comfort me
Nurse What should she do here
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
No no this shall forbid it lie thou there
Laying down her dagger
What if it be a poison which the friar
Subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
Because he married me before to Romeo
I fear it is and yet methinks it should not
For he hath still been tried a holy man
How if when I am laid into the tomb
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me theres a fearful point
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
Or if I live is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night
Together with the terror of the place
As in a vault an ancient receptacle
Where for these many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed
Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
Lies festering in his shroud where as they say
At some hours in the night spirits resort
Alack alack is it not like that I
So early waking what with loathsome smells
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
That living mortals hearing them run mad
O if I wake shall I not be distraught
Environed with all these hideous fears
And madly play with my forefathers joints
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
And in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
As with a club dash out my desperate brains
O look methinks I see my cousins ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapiers point stay Tybalt stay
Romeo I come this do I drink to thee
She falls upon her bed within the curtains
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry
Enter CAPULET

Enter CAPULET
For shame bring Juliet forth her lord is come
Shes dead deceased shes dead alack the day
Alack the day shes dead shes dead shes dead
Ha let me see her out alas shes cold
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
Life and these lips have long been separated
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field
O lamentable day
O woful time
Death that hath taen her hence to make me wail
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS with Musicians
Come is the bride ready to go to church
Ready to go but never to return
O son the night before thy weddingday
Hath Death lain with thy wife There she lies
Flower as she was deflowered by him
Death is my soninlaw Death is my heir
My daughter he hath wedded I will die
And leave him all life living all is Deaths
Have I thought long to see this mornings face
And doth it give me such a sight as this
Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
Most miserable hour that eer time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage
But one poor one one poor and loving child
But one thing to rejoice and solace in
And cruel death hath catchd it from my sight
O woe O woful woful woful day
Most lamentable day most woful day
That ever ever I did yet behold
O day O day O day O hateful day
Never was seen so black a day as this
O woful day O woful day
Beguiled divorced wronged spited slain
Most detestable death by thee beguild
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
O love O life not life but love in death
Despised distressed hated martyrd killd
Uncomfortable time why camest thou now
To murder murder our solemnity
O child O child my soul and not my child
Dead art thou Alack my child is dead
And with my child my joys are buried
Peace ho for shame confusions cure lives not
In these confusions Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
And all the better is it for the maid
Your part in her you could not keep from death
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
The most you sought was her promotion
For twas your heaven she should be advanced
And weep ye now seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
O in this love you love your child so ill
That you run mad seeing that she is well
Shes not well married that lives married long
But shes best married that dies married young
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse and as the custom is
In all her best array bear her to church
For though fond nature bids us an lament
Yet natures tears are reasons merriment
All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral
Our instruments to melancholy bells
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
And all things change them to the contrary
Sir go you in and madam go with him
And go Sir Paris every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill
Move them no more by crossing their high will
Exeunt CAPULET LADY CAPULET PARIS and FRIAR LAURENCE

Exit
What a pestilent knave is this same

mourners and stay dinner
Exeunt
Enter ROMEO
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
My bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
And all this day an unaccustomd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
Strange dream that gives a dead man leave
to think
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
That I revived and was an emperor
Ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
When but loves shadows are so rich in joy
Enter BALTHASAR booted
News from VeronaHow now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
How doth my lady Is my father well
How fares my Juliet that I ask again
For nothing can be ill if she be well
Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels monument
And her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news
Since you did leave it for my office sir
Is it even so then I defy you stars
Thou knowst my lodging get me ink and paper
And hire posthorses I will hence tonight
I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import
Some misadventure
Tush thou art deceived
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar
No my good lord
No matter get thee gone
And hire those horses Ill be with thee straight
Exit BALTHASAR
Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
Lets see for means O mischief thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember an apothecary
And hereabouts he dwellswhich late I noted
In tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows
Culling of simples meagre were his looks
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
An alligator stuffd and other skins
Of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes
Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scatterd to make up a show
Noting this penury to myself I said
An if a man did need a poison now
Whose sale is present death in Mantua
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
O this same thought did but forerun my need
And this same needy man must sell it me
As I remember this should be the house
Being holiday the beggars shop is shut
What ho apothecary
Enter Apothecary
Who calls so loud
Come hither man I see that thou art poor
Hold there is forty ducats let me have
A dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the lifeweary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb
Such mortal drugs I have but Mantuas law
Is death to any he that utters them
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
And fearst to die famine is in thy cheeks
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
The world affords no law to make thee rich
Then be not poor but break it and take this
My poverty but not my will consents
I pay thy poverty and not thy will
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off and if you had the strength
Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
There is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
Doing more murders in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
Farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
Come cordial and not poison go with me
To Juliets grave for there must I use thee
Exeunt
Enter FRIAR JOHN
Holy Franciscan friar brother ho
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua what says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter
Going to find a barefoot brother out
One of our order to associate me
Here in this city visiting the sick
And finding him the searchers of the town
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign
Seald up the doors and would not let us forth
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayd
Who bare my letter then to Romeo
I could not send ithere it is again
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
So fearful were they of infection
Unhappy fortune by my brotherhood
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import and the neglecting it
May do much danger Friar John go hence
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell
Brother Ill go and bring it thee
Exit
Now must I to the monument alone
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents
But I will write again to Mantua
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come
Poor living corse closed in a dead mans tomb
Exit
Enter PARIS and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
Give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof
Yet put it out for I would not be seen
Under yond yewtrees lay thee all along
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
But thou shalt hear it whistle then to me
As signal that thou hearst something approach
Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go
Aside  I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure
Retires
Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
O woe thy canopy is dust and stones
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
Or wanting that with tears distilld by moans
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
The Page whistles
The boy gives warning something doth approach
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight
To cross my obsequies and true loves rite
What with a torch muffle me night awhile
Retires
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR with a torch mattock  and c
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
Hold take this letter early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father
Give me the light upon thy life I charge thee
Whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my ladys face
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring a ring that I must use
In dear employment therefore hence be gone
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
The time and my intents are savagewild
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea
I will be gone sir and not trouble you
So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
Aside  For all this same Ill hide me hereabout
His looks I fear and his intents I doubt
Retires
Thou detestable maw thou womb of death
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open
And in despite Ill cram thee with more food
Opens the tomb
This is that banishd haughty Montague
That murderd my loves cousin with which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies I will apprehend him
Comes forward
Stop thy unhallowd toil vile Montague
Can vengeance be pursued further than death
Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
Obey and go with me for thou must die
I must indeed and therefore came I hither
Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
Fly hence and leave me think upon these gone
Let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury O be gone
By heaven I love thee better than myself
For I come hither armd against myself
Stay not be gone live and hereafter say
A madmans mercy bade thee run away
I do defy thy conjurations
And apprehend thee for a felon here
Wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy
They fight
O Lord they fight I will go call the watch
Exit
O I am slain
Falls
If thou be merciful
Open the tomb lay me with Juliet
Dies
In faith I will Let me peruse this face
Mercutios kinsman noble County Paris
What said my man when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet
Said he not so or did I dream it so
Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet
To think it was so O give me thy hand
One writ with me in sour misfortunes book
Ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
A grave O no a lantern slaughterd youth
For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light
Death lie thou there by a dead man interrd
Laying PARIS in the tomb
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry which their keepers call
A lightning before death O how may I
Call this a lightning O my love my wife
Death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Thou art not conquerd beautys ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
And deaths pale flag is not advanced there
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
O what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy
Forgive me cousin Ah dear Juliet
Why art thou yet so fair shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour
For fear of that I still will stay with thee
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again here here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids O here
Will I set up my everlasting rest
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this worldwearied flesh Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace and lips O you
The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death
Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
Thou desperate pilot now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
Heres to my love
Drinks
O true apothecary
Thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss I die
Dies
Enter at the other end of the churchyard FRIAR LAURENCE with a lantern crow and spade
Saint Francis be my speed how oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves Whos there
Heres one a friend and one that knows you well
Bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls as I discern
It burneth in the Capels monument
It doth so holy sir and theres my master
One that you love
Who is it
Romeo
How long hath he been there
Full half an hour
Go with me to the vault
I dare not sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents
Stay then Ill go alone Fear comes upon me
O much I fear some ill unlucky thing
As I did sleep under this yewtree here
I dreamt my master and another fought
And that my master slew him
Romeo
Advances
Alack alack what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolourd by this place of peace
Enters the tomb
Romeo O pale Who else what Paris too
And steepd in blood Ah what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance
The lady stirs
JULIET wakes
O comfortable friar where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be
And there I am Where is my Romeo
Noise within
I hear some noise Lady come from that nest
Of death contagion and unnatural sleep
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents Come come away
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead
And Paris too Come Ill dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
Stay not to question for the watch is coming
Come go good Juliet
Noise again
I dare no longer stay
Go get thee hence for I will not away
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
Whats here a cup closed in my true loves hand
Poison I see hath been his timeless end
O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop
To help me after I will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
To make die with a restorative
Kisses him
Thy lips are warm
Within  Lead boy which way
Yea noise then Ill be brief O happy dagger
Snatching ROMEOs dagger
This is thy sheath
Stabs herself
there rust and let me die
Falls on ROMEOs body and dies
Enter Watch with the Page of PARIS
This is the place there where the torch doth burn
The ground is bloody search about the churchyard
Go some of you whoeer you find attach
Pitiful sight here lies the county slain
And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
Who here hath lain these two days buried
Go tell the prince run to the Capulets
Raise up the Montagues some others search
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry
Reenter some of the Watch with BALTHASAR
Heres Romeos man we found him in the churchyard
Hold him in safety till the prince come hither
Reenter others of the Watch with FRIAR LAURENCE
Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side
A great suspicion stay the friar too
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
What misadventure is so early up
That calls our person from our mornings rest
Enter CAPULET LADY CAPULET and others
What should it be that they so shriek abroad
The people in the street cry Romeo
Some Juliet and some Paris and all run
With open outcry toward our monument
What fear is this which startles in our ears
Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain
And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before
Warm and new killd
Search seek and know how this foul murder comes
Here is a friar and slaughterd Romeos man
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead mens tombs
O heavens O wife look how our daughter bleeds
This dagger hath mistaenfor lo his house
Is empty on the back of Montague
And it missheathed in my daughters bosom
O me this sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre
Enter MONTAGUE and others
Come Montague for thou art early up
To see thy son and heir more early down
Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
Grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath
What further woe conspires against mine age
Look and thou shalt see
O thou untaught what manners is in this
To press before thy father to a grave
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
Till we can clear these ambiguities
And know their spring their head their
true descent
And then will I be general of your woes
And lead you even to death meantime forbear
And let mischance be slave to patience
Bring forth the parties of suspicion
I am the greatest able to do least
Yet most suspected as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder
And here I stand both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused
Then say at once what thou dost know in this
I will be brief for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
And she there dead that Romeos faithful wife
I married them and their stoln marriageday
Was Tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
Banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city
For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pined
You to remove that siege of grief from her
Betrothd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris then comes she to me
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage
Or in my cell there would she kill herself
Then gave I her so tutord by my art
A sleeping potion which so took effect
As I intended for it wrought on her
The form of death meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrowd grave
Being the time the potions force should cease
But he which bore my letter Friar John
Was stayd by accident and yesternight
Returnd my letter back Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindreds vault
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
But when I came some minute ere the time
Of her awaking here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
She wakes and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
And she too desperate would not go with me
But as it seems did violence on herself
All this I know and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy and if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault let my old life
Be sacrificed some hour before his time
Unto the rigour of severest law
We still have known thee for a holy man
Wheres Romeos man what can he say in this
I brought my master news of Juliets death
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place to this same monument
This letter he early bid me give his father
And threatened me with death going in the vault
I departed not and left him there
Give me the letter I will look on it
Where is the countys page that raised the watch
Sirrah what made your master in this place
He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
And bid me stand aloof and so I did
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
And by and by my master drew on him
And then I ran away to call the watch
This letter doth make good the friars words
Their course of love the tidings of her death
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor pothecary and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
Where be these enemies Capulet Montague
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd
O brother Montague give me thy hand
This is my daughters jointure for no more
Can I demand
But I can give thee more
For I will raise her statue in pure gold
That while Verona by that name is known
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet
As rich shall Romeos by his ladys lie
Poor sacrifices of our enmity
A glooming peace this morning with it brings
The sun for sorrow will not show his head
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things
Some shall be pardond and some punished
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
Exeunt
Enter Hostess and SLY
Ill pheeze you in faith
A pair of stocks you rogue
Ye are a baggage the Slys are no rogues look in
the chronicles we came in with Richard Conqueror
Therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide sessa
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst
No not a denier Go by Jeronimy go to thy cold
bed and warm thee
I know my remedy I must go fetch the
thirdborough
Exit
Third or fourth or fifth borough Ill answer him
by law Ill not budge an inch boy let him come
and kindly
Falls asleep
Horns winded Enter a Lord from hunting with his train
Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds
Brach Merriman the poor cur is embossd
And couple Clowder with the deepmouthd brach
Sawst thou not boy how Silver made it good
At the hedgecorner in the coldest fault
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound
Why Belman is as good as he my lord
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice today pickd out the dullest scent
Trust me I take him for the better dog
Thou art a fool if Echo were as fleet
I would esteem him worth a dozen such
But sup them well and look unto them all
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again
I will my lord
Whats here one dead or drunk See doth he breathe
He breathes my lord Were he not warmd with ale
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
O monstrous beast how like a swine he lies
Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
What think you if he were conveyd to bed
Wrappd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers
A most delicious banquet by his bed
And brave attendants near him when he wakes
Would not the beggar then forget himself
Believe me lord I think he cannot choose
It would seem strange unto him when he waked
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy
Then take him up and manage well the jest
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
Procure me music ready when he wakes
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
And if he chance to speak be ready straight
And with a low submissive reverence
Say What is it your honour will command
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rosewater and bestrewd with flowers
Another bear the ewer the third a diaper
And say Willt please your lordship cool your hands
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear
Another tell him of his hounds and horse
And that his lady mourns at his disease
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic
And when he says he is say that he dreams
For he is nothing but a mighty lord
This do and do it kindly gentle sirs
It will be pastime passing excellent
If it be husbanded with modesty
My lord I warrant you we will play our part
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than what we say he is
Take him up gently and to bed with him
And each one to his office when he wakes
Some bear out SLY A trumpet sounds
Sirrah go see what trumpet tis that sounds
Exit Servingman
Belike some noble gentleman that means
Travelling some journey to repose him here
Reenter Servingman
How now who is it
Ant please your honour players
That offer service to your lordship
Bid them come near
Enter Players
Now fellows you are welcome
We thank your honour
Do you intend to stay with me tonight
So please your lordship to accept our duty
With all my heart This fellow I remember
Since once he playd a farmers eldest son
Twas where you wood the gentlewoman so well
I have forgot your name but sure that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally performd
I think twas Soto that your honour means
Tis very true thou didst it excellent
Well you are come to me in a happy time
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much
There is a lord will hear you play tonight
But I am doubtful of your modesties
Lest overeyeing of his odd behavior
For yet his honour never heard a play
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him for I tell you sirs
If you should smile he grows impatient
Fear not my lord we can contain ourselves
Were he the veriest antic in the world
Go sirrah take them to the buttery
And give them friendly welcome every one
Let them want nothing that my house affords
Exit one with the Players
Sirrah go you to Bartholmew my page
And see him dressd in all suits like a lady
That done conduct him to the drunkards chamber
And call him madam do him obeisance
Tell him from me as he will win my love
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their lords by them accomplished
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
And say What ist your honour will command
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love
And then with kind embracements tempting kisses
And with declining head into his bosom
Bid him shed tears as being overjoyd
To see her noble lord restored to health
Who for this seven years hath esteemd him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar
And if the boy have not a womans gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears
An onion will do well for such a shift
Which in a napkin being close conveyd
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye
See this dispatchd with all the haste thou canst
Anon Ill give thee more instructions
Exit a Servingman
I know the boy will well usurp the grace
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant
Ill in to counsel them haply my presence
May well abate the overmerry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes
Exeunt
Enter aloft SLY with Attendants some with apparel others with basin and ewer and appurtenances and Lord
For Gods sake a pot of small ale
Willt please your lordship drink a cup of sack
Willt please your honour taste of these conserves
What raiment will your honour wear today
I am Christophero Sly call not me honour nor
lordship I neer drank sack in my life and if
you give me any conserves give me conserves of
beef neer ask me what raiment Ill wear for I
have no more doublets than backs no more stockings
than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay
sometimes more feet than shoes or such shoes as my
toes look through the overleather
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour
O that a mighty man of such descent
Of such possessions and so high esteem
Should be infused with so foul a spirit
What would you make me mad Am not I Christopher
Sly old Slys son of Burtonheath by birth a
pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a
bearherd and now by present profession a tinker
Ask Marian Hacket the fat alewife of Wincot if
she know me not if she say I am not fourteen pence
on the score for sheer ale score me up for the
lyingest knave in Christendom What I am not
bestraught heres
O this it is that makes your lady mourn
O this is it that makes your servants droop
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy
O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams
Look how thy servants do attend on thee
Each in his office ready at thy beck
Wilt thou have music hark Apollo plays
Music
And twenty caged nightingales do sing
Or wilt thou sleep well have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimmd up for Semiramis
Say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground
Or wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trappd
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl
Dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth
Say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe
Dost thou love pictures we will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook
And Cytherea all in sedges hid
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
Even as the waving sedges play with wind
Well show thee Io as she was a maid
And how she was beguiled and surprised
As lively painted as the deed was done
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn
Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods oerrun her lovely face
She was the fairest creature in the world
And yet she is inferior to none
Am I a lord and have I such a lady
Or do I dream or have I dreamd till now
I do not sleep I see I hear I speak
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things
Upon my life I am a lord indeed
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly
Well bring our lady hither to our sight
And once again a pot o the smallest ale
Willt please your mightiness to wash your hands
O how we joy to see your wit restored
O that once more you knew but what you are
These fifteen years you have been in a dream
Or when you waked so waked as if you slept
These fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap
But did I never speak of all that time
O yes my lord but very idle words
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door
And rail upon the hostess of the house
And say you would present her at the leet
Because she brought stone jugs and no seald quarts
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket
Ay the womans maid of the house
Why sir you know no house nor no such maid
Nor no such men as you have reckond up
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends
Amen
I thank thee thou shalt not lose by it
Enter the Page as a lady with attendants
How fares my noble lord
Marry I fare well for here is cheer enough
Where is my wife
Here noble lord what is thy will with her
Are you my wife and will not call me husband
My men should call me lord I am your goodman
My husband and my lord my lord and husband
I am your wife in all obedience
I know it well What must I call her
Madam
Alce madam or Joan madam
Madam and nothing else so lords
call ladies
Madam wife they say that I have dreamd
And slept above some fifteen year or more
Ay and the time seems thirty unto me
Being all this time abandond from your bed
Tis much Servants leave me and her alone
Madam undress you and come now to bed
Thrice noble lord let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two
Or if not so until the sun be set
For your physicians have expressly charged
In peril to incur your former malady
That I should yet absent me from your bed
I hope this reason stands for my excuse
Ay it stands so that I may hardly
tarry so long But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams again I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and the blood
Enter a Messenger
Your honours players heating your amendment
Are come to play a pleasant comedy
For so your doctors hold it very meet
Seeing too much sadness hath congeald your blood
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
Marry I will let them play it Is not a
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumblingtrick
No my good lord it is more pleasing stuff
What household stuff
It is a kind of history
Well well seet Come madam wife sit by my side
and let the world slip we shall neer be younger
Flourish
Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
Tranio since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua nursery of arts
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy
The pleasant garden of great Italy
And by my fathers love and leave am armd
With his good will and thy good company
My trusty servant well approved in all
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies
Pisa renownd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first
A merchant of great traffic through the world
Vincetino come of Bentivolii
Vincetinos son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds
And therefore Tranio for the time I study
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved
Tell me thy mind for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
Mi perdonato gentle master mine
I am in all affected as yourself
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
Only good master while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline
Lets be no stoics nor no stocks I pray
Or so devote to Aristotles cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
Music and poesy use to quicken you
The mathematics and the metaphysics
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
No profit grows where is no pleasure taen
In brief sir study what you most affect
Gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise
If Biondello thou wert come ashore
We could at once put us in readiness
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget
But stay a while what company is this
Master some show to welcome us to town
Enter BAPTISTA KATHARINA BIANCA GREMIO and HORTENSIO LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
Gentlemen importune me no farther
For how I firmly am resolved you know
That is not bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder
If either of you both love Katharina
Because I know you well and love you well
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure
Aside  To cart her rather shes too rough for me
There There Hortensio will you any wife
I pray you sir is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates
Mates maid how mean you that no mates for you
Unless you were of gentler milder mould
Ifaith sir you shall never need to fear
I wis it is not half way to her heart
But if it were doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a threeleggd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool
From all such devils good Lord deliver us
And me too good Lord
Hush master heres some good pastime toward
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward
But in the others silence do I see
Maids mild behavior and sobriety
Peace Tranio
Well said master mum and gaze your fill
Gentlemen that I may soon make good
What I have said Bianca get you in
And let it not displease thee good Bianca
For I will love thee neer the less my girl
A pretty peat it is best
Put finger in the eye an she knew why
Sister content you in my discontent
Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe
My books and instruments shall be my company
Hark Tranio thou mayst hear Minerva speak
Signior Baptista will you be so strange
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Biancas grief
Why will you mew her up
Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell
And make her bear the penance of her tongue
Gentlemen content ye I am resolved
Go in Bianca
Exit BIANCA
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music instruments and poetry
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
Fit to instruct her youth If you Hortensio
Or Signior Gremio you know any such
Prefer them hither for to cunning men
I will be very kind and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing up
And so farewell Katharina you may stay
For I have more to commune with Bianca
Exit
Why and I trust I may go too may I not What
shall I be appointed hours as though belike I
knew not what to take and what to leave ha
Exit
You may go to the devils dam your gifts are so
good heres none will hold you Their love is not
so great Hortensio but we may blow our nails
together and fast it fairly out our cakes dough on
both sides Farewell yet for the love I bear my
sweet Bianca if I can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights I will
wish him to her father
So will I Signior Gremio but a word I pray
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in Biancos love to
labour and effect one thing specially
Whats that I pray
Marry sir to get a husband for her sister
A husband a devil
I say a husband
I say a devil Thinkest thou Hortensio though
her father be very rich any man is so very a fool
to be married to hell
Tush Gremio though it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums why man there be good
fellows in the world an a man could light on them
would take her with all faults and money enough
I cannot tell but I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition to be whipped at the high cross
every morning
Faith as you say theres small choice in rotten
apples But come since this bar in law makes us
friends it shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptistas eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband
and then have tot a fresh Sweet Bianca Happy man
be his dole He that runs fastest gets the ring
How say you Signior Gremio
I am agreed and would I had given him the best
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her Come on
Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
I pray sir tell me is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold
O Tranio till I found it to be true
I never thought it possible or likely
But see while idly I stood looking on
I found the effect of love in idleness
And now in plainness do confess to thee
That art to me as secret and as dear
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was
Tranio I burn I pine I perish Tranio
If I achieve not this young modest girl
Counsel me Tranio for I know thou canst
Assist me Tranio for I know thou wilt
Master it is no time to chide you now
Affection is not rated from the heart
If love have touchd you nought remains but so
Redime te captum quam queas minimo
Gramercies lad go forward this contents
The rest will comfort for thy counsels sound
Master you lookd so longly on the maid
Perhaps you markd not whats the pith of all
O yes I saw sweet beauty in her face
Such as the daughter of Agenor had
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand
When with his knees he kissd the Cretan strand
Saw you no more markd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din
Tranio I saw her coral lips to move
And with her breath she did perfume the air
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her
Nay then tis time to stir him from his trance
I pray awake sir if you love the maid
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her Thus it stands
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her
Master your love must live a maid at home
And therefore has he closely mewd her up
Because she will not be annoyd with suitors
Ah Tranio what a cruel fathers he
But art thou not advised he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
Ay marry am I sir and now tis plotted
I have it Tranio
Master for my hand
Both our inventions meet and jump in one
Tell me thine first
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the maid
Thats your device
It is may it be done
Not possible for who shall bear your part
And be in Padua here Vincentios son
Keep house and ply his book welcome his friends
Visit his countrymen and banquet them
Basta content thee for I have it full
We have not yet been seen in any house
Nor can we lie distinguishd by our faces
For man or master then it follows thus
Thou shalt be master Tranio in my stead
Keep house and port and servants as I should
I will some other be some Florentine
Some Neapolitan or meaner man of Pisa
Tis hatchd and shall be so Tranio at once
Uncase thee take my colourd hat and cloak
When Biondello comes he waits on thee
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue
So had you need
In brief sir sith it your pleasure is
And I am tied to be obedient
For so your father charged me at our parting
Be serviceable to my son quoth he
Although I think twas in another sense
I am content to be Lucentio
Because so well I love Lucentio
Tranio be so because Lucentio loves
And let me be a slave to achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thralld my wounded eye
Here comes the rogue
Enter BIONDELLO
Sirrah where have you been
Where have I been Nay how now where are you
Master has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes Or
you stolen his or both pray whats the news
Sirrah come hither tis no time to jest
And therefore frame your manners to the time
Your fellow Tranio here to save my life
Puts my apparel and my countenance on
And I for my escape have put on his
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I killd a man and fear I was descried
Wait you on him I charge you as becomes
While I make way from hence to save my life
You understand me
I sir neer a whit
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth
Tranio is changed into Lucentio
The better for him would I were so too
So could I faith boy to have the next wish after
That Lucentio indeed had Baptistas youngest daughter
But sirrah not for my sake but your masters I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
When I am alone why then I am Tranio
But in all places else your master Lucentio
Tranio lets go one thing more rests that
thyself execute to make one among these wooers if
thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good
and weighty
Exeunt
The presenters above speak
My lord you nod you do not mind the play
Yes by Saint Anne do I A good matter surely
comes there any more of it
My lord tis but begun
Tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady
would twere done
They sit and mark
Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
Verona for a while I take my leave
To see my friends in Padua but of all
My best beloved and approved friend
Hortensio and I trow this is his house
Here sirrah Grumio knock I say
Knock sir whom should I knock is there man has
rebused your worship
Villain I say knock me here soundly
Knock you here sir why sir what am I sir that
I should knock you here sir
Villain I say knock me at this gate
And rap me well or Ill knock your knaves pate
My master is grown quarrelsome I should knock
you first
And then I know after who comes by the worst
Will it not be
Faith sirrah an youll not knock Ill ring it
Ill try how you can sol fa and sing it
He wrings him by the ears
Help masters help my master is mad
Now knock when I bid you sirrah villain
Enter HORTENSIO
How now whats the matter My old friend Grumio
and my good friend Petruchio How do you all at Verona
Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray
Con tutto il cuore ben trovato may I say
Alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor
mio Petruchio Rise Grumio rise we will compound
this quarrel
Nay tis no matter sir what he leges in Latin
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly sir well was it fit for a servant to
use his master so being perhaps for aught I see
two and thirty a pip out Whom would to God I had
well knockd at first Then had not Grumio come by the worst
A senseless villain Good Hortensio
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
And could not get him for my heart to do it
Knock at the gate O heavens Spake you not these
words plain Sirrah knock me here rap me here
knock me well and knock me soundly And come you
now with knocking at the gate
Sirrah be gone or talk not I advise you
Petruchio patience I am Grumios pledge
Why thiss a heavy chance twixt him and you
Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio
And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona
Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Where small experience grows But in a few
Signior Hortensio thus it stands with me
Antonio my father is deceased
And I have thrust myself into this maze
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home
And so am come abroad to see the world
Petruchio shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd illfavourd wife
Thouldst thank me but a little for my counsel
And yet Ill promise thee she shall be rich
And very rich but thourt too much my friend
And Ill not wish thee to her
Signior Hortensio twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice and therefore if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchios wife
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance
Be she as foul as was Florentius love
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates Xanthippe or a worse
She moves me not or not removes at least
Affections edge in me were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua
If wealthily then happily in Padua
Nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his
mind is Why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an agletbaby or an old trot with neer
a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses why nothing comes amiss
so money comes withal
Petruchio since we are steppd thus far in
I will continue that I broachd in jest
I can Petruchio help thee to a wife
With wealth enough and young and beauteous
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
Her only fault and that is faults enough
Is that she is intolerable curst
And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
That were my state far worser than it is
I would not wed her for a mine of gold
Hortensio peace thou knowst not golds effect
Tell me her fathers name and tis enough
For I will board her though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
Her father is Baptista Minola
An affable and courteous gentleman
Her name is Katharina Minola
Renownd in Padua for her scolding tongue
I know her father though I know not her
And he knew my deceased father well
I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter
Unless you will accompany me thither
I pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts
O my word an she knew him as well as I do she
would think scolding would do little good upon him
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so
why thats nothing an he begin once hell rail in
his ropetricks Ill tell you what sir an she
stand him but a little he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat
You know him not sir
Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee
For in Baptistas keep my treasure is
He hath the jewel of my life in hold
His youngest daughter beautiful Binaca
And her withholds from me and other more
Suitors to her and rivals in my love
Supposing it a thing impossible
For those defects I have before rehearsed
That ever Katharina will be wood
Therefore this order hath Baptista taen
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband
Katharina the curst
A title for a maid of all titles the worst
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music to instruct Bianca
That so I may by this device at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself
Heres no knavery See to beguile the old folks
how the young folks lay their heads together
Enter GREMIO and LUCENTIO disguised
Master master look about you who goes there ha
Peace Grumio it is the rival of my love
Petruchio stand by a while
A proper stripling and an amorous
O very well I have perused the note
Hark you sir Ill have them very fairly bound
All books of love see that at any hand
And see you read no other lectures to her
You understand me over and beside
Signior Baptistas liberality
Ill mend it with a largess Take your paper too
And let me have them very well perfumed
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to What will you read to her
Whateer I read to her Ill plead for you
As for my patron stand you so assured
As firmly as yourself were still in place
Yea and perhaps with more successful words
Than you unless you were a scholar sir
O this learning what a thing it is
O this woodcock what an ass it is
Peace sirrah
Grumio mum God save you Signior Gremio
And you are well met Signior Hortensio
Trow you whither I am going To Baptista Minola
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man for learning and behavior
Fit for her turn well read in poetry
And other books good ones I warrant ye
Tis well and I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another
A fine musician to instruct our mistress
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca so beloved of me
Beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove
And that his bags shall prove
Gremio tis now no time to vent our love
Listen to me and if you speak me fair
Ill tell you news indifferent good for either
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met
Upon agreement from us to his liking
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina
Yea and to marry her if her dowry please
So said so done is well
Hortensio have you told him all her faults
I know she is an irksome brawling scold
If that be all masters I hear no harm
No sayst me so friend What countryman
Born in Verona old Antonios son
My father dead my fortune lives for me
And I do hope good days and long to see
O sir such a life with such a wife were strange
But if you have a stomach tot i Gods name
You shall have me assisting you in all
But will you woo this wildcat
Will I live
Will he woo her ay or Ill hang her
Why came I hither but to that intent
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears
Have I not in my time heard lions roar
Have I not heard the sea puffd up with winds
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field
And heavens artillery thunder in the skies
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang
And do you tell me of a womans tongue
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmers fire
Tush tush fear boys with bugs
For he fears none
Hortensio hark
This gentleman is happily arrived
My mind presumes for his own good and ours
I promised we would be contributors
And bear his charging of wooing whatsoeer
And so we will provided that he win her
I would I were as sure of a good dinner
Enter TRANIO brave and BIONDELLO
Gentlemen God save you If I may be bold
Tell me I beseech you which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola
He that has the two fair daughters ist he you mean
Even he Biondello
Hark you sir you mean not her to
Perhaps him and her sir what have you to do
Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray
I love no chiders sir Biondello lets away
Well begun Tranio
Sir a word ere you go
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
And if I be sir is it any offence
No if without more words you will get you hence
Why sir I pray are not the streets as free
For me as for you
But so is not she
For what reason I beseech you
For this reason if youll know
That shes the choice love of Signior Gremio
That shes the chosen of Signior Hortensio
Softly my masters if you be gentlemen
Do me this right hear me with patience
Baptista is a noble gentleman
To whom my father is not all unknown
And were his daughter fairer than she is
She may more suitors have and me for one
Fair Ledas daughter had a thousand wooers
Then well one more may fair Bianca have
And so she shall Lucentio shall make one
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone
What this gentleman will outtalk us all
Sir give him head I know hell prove a jade
Hortensio to what end are all these words
Sir let me be so bold as ask you
Did you yet ever see Baptistas daughter
No sir but hear I do that he hath two
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty
Sir sir the firsts for me let her go by
Yea leave that labour to great Hercules
And let it be more than Alcides twelve
Sir understand you this of me in sooth
The younges t daughter whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all access of suitors
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed
The younger then is free and not before
If it be so sir that you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest
And if you break the ice and do this feat
Achieve the elder set the younger free
For our access whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate
Sir you say well and well you do conceive
And since you do profess to be a suitor
You must as we do gratify this gentleman
To whom we all rest generally beholding
Sir I shall not be slack in sign whereof
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon
And quaff carouses to our mistress health
And do as adversaries do in law
Strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
O excellent motion Fellows lets be gone
The motions good indeed and be it so
Petruchio I shall be your ben venuto
Exeunt
Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA
Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself

Or what you will command me will I do
So well I know my duty to my elders
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
Whom thou lovest best see thou dissemble not
Believe me sister of all the men alive

Which I could fancy more than any other
Minion thou liest Ist not Hortensio
If you affect him sister here I swear
Ill plead for you myself but you shall have
him
O then belike you fancy riches more
You will have Gremio to keep you fair

Nay then you jest and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while
I prithee sister Kate untie my hands
If that be jest then all the rest was so
Strikes her
Enter BAPTISTA
Why how now dame whence grows this insolence
Bianca stand aside Poor girl she weeps
Go ply thy needle meddle not with her
For shame thou helding of a devilish spirit
Why dost thou wrong her that did neer wrong thee
When did she cross thee with a bitter word
Her silence flouts me and Ill be revenged
Flies after BIANCA
What in my sight Bianca get thee in
Exit BIANCA
What will you not suffer me Nay now I see
She is your treasure she must have a husband
I must dance barefoot on her wedding day
And for your love to her lead apes in hell
Talk not to me I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge
Exit
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I
But who comes here
Enter GREMIO LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man  PETRUCHIO with HORTENSIO as a musician and TRANIO with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books
Good morrow neighbour Baptista
Good morrow neighbour Gremio
God save you gentlemen
And you good sir Pray have you not a daughter
Calld Katharina fair and virtuous
I have a daughter sir called Katharina
You are too blunt go to it orderly
You wrong me Signior Gremio give me leave
I am a gentleman of Verona sir
That hearing of her beauty and her wit
Her affability and bashful modesty
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard
And for an entrance to my entertainment
I do present you with a man of mine
Presenting HORTENSIO
Cunning in music and the mathematics
To instruct her fully in those sciences
Whereof I know she is not ignorant
Accept of him or else you do me wrong
His name is Licio born in Mantua
Youre welcome sir and he for your good sake
But for my daughter Katharina this I know
She is not for your turn the more my grief
I see you do not mean to part with her
Or else you like not of my company
Mistake me not I speak but as I find
Whence are you sir what may I call your name
Petruchio is my name Antonios son
A man well known throughout all Italy
I know him well you are welcome for his sake
Saving your tale Petruchio I pray
Let us that are poor petitioners speak too
Baccare you are marvellous forward
O pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing
I doubt it not sir but you will curse your
wooing Neighbour this is a gift very grateful I am
sure of it To express the like kindness myself
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any freely give unto you this young scholar
Presenting LUCENTIO
that hath been long studying at Rheims as cunning
in Greek Latin and other languages as the other
in music and mathematics his name is Cambio pray
accept his service
A thousand thanks Signior Gremio
Welcome good Cambio
To TRANIO
But gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming
Pardon me sir the boldness is mine own
That being a stranger in this city here
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter
Unto Bianca fair and virtuous
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
In the preferment of the eldest sister
This liberty is all that I request
That upon knowledge of my parentage
I may have welcome mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest
And toward the education of your daughters
I here bestow a simple instrument
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books
If you accept them then their worth is great
Lucentio is your name of whence I pray
Of Pisa sir son to Vincentio
A mighty man of Pisa by report
I know him well you are very welcome sir
Take you the lute and you the set of books
You shall go see your pupils presently
Holla within
Enter a Servant
Sirrah lead these gentlemen
To my daughters and tell them both
These are their tutors bid them use them well
Exit Servant with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO BIONDELLO following
We will go walk a little in the orchard
And then to dinner You are passing welcome
And so I pray you all to think yourselves
Signior Baptista my business asketh haste
And every day I cannot come to woo
You knew my father well and in him me
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods
Which I have betterd rather than decreased
Then tell me if I get your daughters love
What dowry shall I have with her to wife
After my death the one half of my lands
And in possession twenty thousand crowns
And for that dowry Ill assure her of
Her widowhood be it that she survive me
In all my lands and leases whatsoever
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us
That covenants may be kept on either hand
Ay when the special thing is well obtaind
That is her love for that is all in all
Why that is nothing for I tell you father
I am as peremptory as she proudminded
And where two raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury
Though little fire grows great with little wind
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
So I to her and so she yields to me
For I am rough and woo not like a babe
Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
But be thou armd for some unhappy words
Ay to the proof as mountains are for winds
That shake not though they blow perpetually
Reenter HORTENSIO with his head broke
How now my friend why dost thou look so pale
For fear I promise you if I look pale
What will my daughter prove a good musician
I think shell sooner prove a soldier
Iron may hold with her but never lutes
Why then thou canst not break her to the lute
Why no for she hath broke the lute to me
I did but tell her she mistook her frets
And bowd her hand to teach her fingering
When with a most impatient devilish spirit
Frets call you these quoth she Ill fume
with them
And with that word she struck me on the head
And through the instrument my pate made way
And there I stood amazed for a while
As on a pillory looking through the lute
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms
As had she studied to misuse me so
Now by the world it is a lusty wench
I love her ten times more than eer I did
O how I long to have some chat with her
Well go with me and be not so discomfited
Shes apt to learn and thankful for good turns
Signior Petruchio will you go with us
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you
I pray you do
Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
I will attend her here
And woo her with some spirit when she comes
Say that she rail why then Ill tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale
Say that she frown Ill say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly washd with dew
Say she be mute and will not speak a word
Then Ill commend her volubility
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence
If she do bid me pack Ill give her thanks
As though she bid me stay by her a week
If she deny to wed Ill crave the day
When I shall ask the banns and when be married
But here she comes and now Petruchio speak
Enter KATHARINA
Good morrow Kate for thats your name I hear
Well have you heard but something hard of hearing
They call me Katharina that do talk of me
You lie in faith for you are calld plain Kate
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst
But Kate the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall my superdainty Kate
For dainties are all Kates and therefore Kate
Take this of me Kate of my consolation
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town
Thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife
Moved in good time let him that moved you hither
Remove you hence I knew you at the first
You were a moveable
Why whats a moveable
A joindstool
Thou hast hit it come sit on me
Asses are made to bear and so are you
Women are made to bear and so are you
No such jade as you if me you mean
Alas good Kate I will not burden thee
For knowing thee to be but young and light
Too light for such a swain as you to catch
And yet as heavy as my weight should be
Should be shouldbuzz
Well taen and like a buzzard
O slowwingd turtle shall a buzzard take thee
Ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
Come come you wasp i faith you are too angry
If I be waspish best beware my sting
My remedy is then to pluck it out
Ay if the fool could find it where it lies
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting In his tail
In his tongue
Whose tongue
Yours if you talk of tails and so farewell
What with my tongue in your tail nay come again
Good Kate I am a gentleman
That Ill try
She strikes him
I swear Ill cuff you if you strike again
So may you lose your arms
If you strike me you are no gentleman
And if no gentleman why then no arms
A herald Kate O put me in thy books
What is your crest a coxcomb
A combless cock so Kate will be my hen
No cock of mine you crow too like a craven
Nay come Kate come you must not look so sour
It is my fashion when I see a crab
Why heres no crab and therefore look not sour
There is there is
Then show it me
Had I a glass I would
What you mean my face
Well aimd of such a young one
Now by Saint George I am too young for you
Yet you are witherd
Tis with cares
I care not
Nay hear you Kate in sooth you scape not so
I chafe you if I tarry let me go
No not a whit I find you passing gentle
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
And now I find report a very liar
For thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous
But slow in speech yet sweet as springtime flowers
Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
But thou with mildness entertainst thy wooers
With gentle conference soft and affable
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp
O slanderous world Kate like the hazeltwig
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
O let me see thee walk thou dost not halt
Go fool and whom thou keepst command
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait
O be thou Dian and let her be Kate
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful
Where did you study all this goodly speech
It is extempore from my motherwit
A witty mother witless else her son
Am I not wise
Yes keep you warm
Marry so I mean sweet Katharina in thy bed
And therefore setting all this chat aside
Thus in plain terms your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
And Will you nill you I will marry you
Now Kate I am a husband for your turn
For by this light whereby I see thy beauty
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
Thou must be married to no man but me
For I am he am born to tame you Kate
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates
Here comes your father never make denial
I must and will have Katharina to my wife
Reenter BAPTISTA GREMIO and TRANIO
Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter
How but well sir how but well
It were impossible I should speed amiss
Why how now daughter Katharina in your dumps
Call you me daughter now I promise you
You have showd a tender fatherly regard
To wish me wed to one half lunatic
A madcup ruffian and a swearing Jack
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out
Father tis thus yourself and all the world
That talkd of her have talkd amiss of her
If she be curst it is for policy
For shes not froward but modest as the dove
She is not hot but temperate as the morn
For patience she will prove a second Grissel
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity
And to conclude we have greed so well together
That upon Sunday is the weddingday
Ill see thee hangd on Sunday first
Hark Petruchio she says shell see thee
hangd first
Is this your speeding nay then good night our part
Be patient gentlemen I choose her for myself
If she and I be pleased whats that to you
Tis bargaind twixt us twain being alone
That she shall still be curst in company
I tell you tis incredible to believe
How much she loves me O the kindest Kate
She hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast protesting oath on oath
That in a twink she won me to her love
O you are novices tis a world to see
How tame when men and women are alone
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
Give me thy hand Kate I will unto Venice
To buy apparel gainst the weddingday
Provide the feast father and bid the guests
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine
I know not what to say but give me your hands
God send you joy Petruchio tis a match
Amen say we we will be witnesses
Father and wife and gentlemen adieu
I will to Venice Sunday comes apace
We will have rings and things and fine array
And kiss me Kate we will be married oSunday
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
Was ever match clappd up so suddenly
Faith gentlemen now I play a merchants part
And venture madly on a desperate mart
Twas a commodity lay fretting by you
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
The gain I seek is quiet in the match
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
But now Baptists to your younger daughter
Now is the day we long have looked for
I am your neighbour and was suitor first
And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess
Youngling thou canst not love so dear as I
Graybeard thy love doth freeze
But thine doth fry
Skipper stand back tis age that nourisheth
But youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth
Content you gentlemen I will compound this strife
Tis deeds must win the prize and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Biancas love
Say Signior Gremio What can you assure her
First as you know my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry
In ivory coffers I have stuffd my crowns
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints
Costly apparel tents and canopies
Fine linen Turkey cushions bossd with pearl
Valance of Venice gold in needlework
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
To house or housekeeping then at my farm
I have a hundred milchkine to the pail
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls
And all things answerable to this portion
Myself am struck in years I must confess
And if I die tomorrow this is hers
If whilst I live she will be only mine
That only came well in Sir list to me
I am my fathers heir and only son
If I may have your daughter to my wife
Ill leave her houses three or four as good
Within rich Pisa walls as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
What have I pinchd you Signior Gremio
Two thousand ducats by the year of land
My land amounts not to so much in all
That she shall have besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles road
What have I choked you with an argosy
Gremio tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies besides two galliases
And twelve tight galleys these I will assure her
And twice as much whateer thou offerst next
Nay I have offerd all I have no more
And she can have no more than all I have
If you like me she shall have me and mine
Why then the maid is mine from all the world
By your firm promise Gremio is outvied
I must confess your offer is the best
And let your father make her the assurance
She is your own else you must pardon me
if you should die before him wheres her dower
Thats but a cavil he is old I young
And may not young men die as well as old
Well gentlemen
I am thus resolved on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharina is to be married
Now on the Sunday following shall Bianca
Be bride to you if you this assurance
If not Signior Gremio
And so I take my leave and thank you both
Adieu good neighbour
Exit BAPTISTA
Now I fear thee not
Sirrah young gamester your father were a fool
To give thee all and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table tut a toy
An old Italian fox is not so kind my boy
Exit
A vengeance on your crafty witherd hide
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten
Tis in my head to do my master good
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father calld supposed Vincentio
And thats a wonder fathers commonly
Do get their children but in this case of wooing
A child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning
Exit
Enter LUCENTIO HORTENSIO and BIANCA
Fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal
But wrangling pedant this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony
Then give me leave to have prerogative
And when in music we have spent an hour
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much
Preposterous ass that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordaind
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain
Then give me leave to read philosophy
And while I pause serve in your harmony
Sirrah I will not bear these braves of thine
Why gentlemen you do me double wrong
To strive for that which resteth in my choice
I am no breeching scholar in the schools
Ill not be tied to hours nor pointed times
But learn my lessons as I please myself
And to cut off all strife here sit we down
Take you your instrument play you the whiles
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned
Youll leave his lecture when I am in tune
That will be never tune your instrument
Where left we last
Here madam
Hic ibat Simois hic est Sigeia tellus
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis
Construe them
Hic ibat as I told you before Simois I am
Lucentio hic est son unto Vincentio of Pisa
Sigeia tellus disguised thus to get your love
Hic steterat and that Lucentio that comes
awooing Priami is my man Tranio regia
bearing my port celsa senis that we might
beguile the old pantaloon
Madam my instruments in tune
Lets hear O fie the treble jars
Spit in the hole man and tune again
Now let me see if I can construe it Hic ibat
Simois I know you not hic est Sigeia tellus I
trust you not Hic steterat Priami take heed
he hear us not regia presume not celsa senis
despair not
Madam tis now in tune
All but the base
The base is right tis the base knave that jars
Aside
How fiery and forward our pedant is
Now for my life the knave doth court my love
Pedascule Ill watch you better yet
In time I may believe yet I mistrust
Mistrust it not for sure AEacides
Was Ajax calld so from his grandfather
I must believe my master else I promise you
I should be arguing still upon that doubt
But let it rest Now Licio to you
Good masters take it not unkindly pray
That I have been thus pleasant with you both
You may go walk and give me leave a while
My lessons make no music in three parts
Are you so formal sir well I must wait
Aside
And watch withal for but I be deceived
Our fine musician groweth amorous
Madam before you touch the instrument
To learn the order of my fingering
I must begin with rudiments of art
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort
More pleasant pithy and effectual
Than hath been taught by any of my trade
And there it is in writing fairly drawn
Why I am past my gamut long ago
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio
Reads  Gamut I am the ground of all accord
A re to Plead Hortensios passion
B mi Bianca take him for thy lord
C fa ut that loves with all affection
D sol re one clef two notes have I
E la mi show pity or I die
Call you this gamut tut I like it not
Old fashions please me best I am not so nice
To change true rules for old inventions
Enter a Servant
Mistress your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sisters chamber up
You know tomorrow is the weddingday
Farewell sweet masters both I must be gone
Exeunt BIANCA and Servant
Faith mistress then I have no cause to stay
Exit
But I have cause to pry into this pedant
Methinks he looks as though he were in love
Yet if thy thoughts Bianca be so humble
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale
Seize thee that list if once I find thee ranging
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing
Exit
Enter BAPTISTA GREMIO TRANIO KATHARINA BIANCA LUCENTIO and others attendants
To TRANIO  Signior Lucentio this is the
pointed day
That Katharina and Petruchio should be married
And yet we hear not of our soninlaw
What will be said what mockery will it be
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours
No shame but mine I must forsooth be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen
Who wood in haste and means to wed at leisure
I told you I he was a frantic fool
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior
And to be noted for a merry man
Hell woo a thousand point the day of marriage
Make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns
Yet never means to wed where he hath wood
Now must the world point at poor Katharina
And say Lo there is mad Petruchios wife
If it would please him come and marry her
Patience good Katharina and Baptista too
Upon my life Petruchio means but well
Whatever fortune stays him from his word
Though he be blunt I know him passing wise
Though he be merry yet withal hes honest
Would Katharina had never seen him though
Exit weeping followed by BIANCA and others
Go girl I cannot blame thee now to weep
For such an injury would vex a very saint
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
Enter BIONDELLO
Master master news old news and such news as
you never heard of
Is it new and old too how may that be
Why is it not news to hear of Petruchios coming
Is he come
Why no sir
What then
He is coming
When will he be here
When he stands where I am and sees you there
But say what to thine old news
Why Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair
of boots that have been candlecases one buckled
another laced an old rusty sword taen out of the
townarmory with a broken hilt and chapeless
with two broken points his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred
besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine troubled with the lampass infected
with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with
spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives
stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the
bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten
nearlegged before and with a halfchequed bit
and a headstall of sheeps leather which being
restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots one girth
six time pieced and a womans crupper of velure
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs and here and there pieced with packthread
Who comes with him
O sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned
like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red
and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty
fancies pricked int for a feather a monster a
very monster in apparel and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentlemans lackey
Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion
Yet oftentimes he goes but meanapparelld
I am glad hes come howsoeer he comes
Why sir he comes not
Didst thou not say he comes
Who that Petruchio came
Ay that Petruchio came
No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back
Why thats all one
Nay by Saint Jamy
I hold you a penny
A horse and a man
Is more than one
And yet not many
Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
Come where be these gallants whos at home
You are welcome sir
And yet I come not well
And yet you halt not
Not so well apparelld
As I wish you were
Were it better I should rush in thus
But where is Kate where is my lovely bride
How does my father Gentles methinks you frown
And wherefore gaze this goodly company
As if they saw some wondrous monument
Some comet or unusual prodigy
Why sir you know this is your weddingday
First were we sad fearing you would not come
Now sadder that you come so unprovided
Fie doff this habit shame to your estate
An eyesore to our solemn festival
And tells us what occasion of import
Hath all so long detaind you from your wife
And sent you hither so unlike yourself
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word
Though in some part enforced to digress
Which at more leisure I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal
But where is Kate I stay too long from her
The morning wears tis time we were at church
See not your bride in these unreverent robes
Go to my chamber Put on clothes of mine
Not I believe me thus Ill visit her
But thus I trust you will not marry her
Good sooth even thus therefore ha done with words
To me shes married not unto my clothes
Could I repair what she will wear in me
As I can change these poor accoutrements
Twere well for Kate and better for myself
But what a fool am I to chat with you
When I should bid good morrow to my bride
And seal the title with a lovely kiss
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
He hath some meaning in his mad attire
We will persuade him be it possible
To put on better ere he go to church
Ill after him and see the event of this
Exeunt BAPTISTA GREMIO and attendants
But to her love concerneth us to add
Her fathers liking which to bring to pass
As I before unparted to your worship
I am to get a manwhateer he be
It skills not much well fit him to our turn
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
And marry sweet Bianca with consent
Were it not that my fellowschoolmaster
Doth watch Biancas steps so narrowly
Twere good methinks to steal our marriage
Which once performd let all the world say no
Ill keep mine own despite of all the world
That by degrees we mean to look into
And watch our vantage in this business
Well overreach the greybeard Gremio
The narrowprying father Minola
The quaint musician amorous Licio
All for my masters sake Lucentio
Reenter GREMIO
Signior Gremio came you from the church
As willingly as eer I came from school
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home
A bridegroom say you tis a groom indeed
A grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
Curster than she why tis impossible
Why hes a devil a devil a very fiend
Why shes a devil a devil the devils dam
Tut shes a lamb a dove a fool to him
Ill tell you Sir Lucentio when the priest
Should ask if Katharina should be his wife
Ay by gogswouns quoth he and swore so loud
That allamazed the priest let fall the book
And as he stoopd again to take it up
The madbraind bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest
Now take them up quoth he if any list
What said the wench when he rose again
Trembled and shook for why he stampd and swore
As if the vicar meant to cozen him
But after many ceremonies done
He calls for wine A health quoth he as if
He had been aboard carousing to his mates
After a storm quaffd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sextons face
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seemd to ask him sops as he was drinking
This done he took the bride about the neck
And kissd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo
And I seeing this came thence for very shame
And after me I know the rout is coming
Such a mad marriage never was before
Hark hark I hear the minstrels play

mistress fallen out
How
Out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby
hangs a tale
Lets hat good Grumio
Lend thine ear

And therefore tis called a sensible tale and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech
listening Now I begin Imprimis we came down a
foul hill my master riding behind my mistress
Both of one horse
Whats that to thee
Why a horse
Tell thou the tale but hadst thou not crossed me
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place how she was bemoiled how he left her
with the horse upon her how he beat me because
her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed
that never prayed before how I cried how the
horses ran away how her bridle was burst how I
lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she
Ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes home But what talk I of this
Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip

Do you hear ho you must meet my master to

I tell thee Kate twas burnt and dried away
And I expressly am forbid to touch it
For it engenders choler planteth anger

Thus have I politicly begun my reign
And tis my hope to end successfully
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty
And till she stoop she must not be fullgorged
For then she never looks upon her lure
Another way I have to man my haggard
To make her come and know her keepers call
That is to watch her as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient
She eat no meat today nor none shall eat
Last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
As with the meat some undeserved fault
Ill find about the making of the bed
And here Ill fling the pillow there the bolster
This way the coverlet another way the sheets
Ay and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her
And in conclusion she shall watch all night
And if she chance to nod Ill rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness
And thus Ill curb her mad and headstrong humour
He that knows better how to tame a shrew
Now let him speak tis charity to show

Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO
Ist possible friend Licio that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio
I tell you sir she bears me fair in hand
Sir to satisfy you in what I have said
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching
Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO
Now mistress profit you in what you read
What master read you first resolve me that
I read that I profess the Art to Love
And may you prove sir master of your art
While you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart
Quick proceeders marry Now tell me I pray
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio
O despiteful love unconstant womankind
I tell thee Licio this is wonderful
Mistake no more I am not Licio
Nor a musician as I seem to be
But one that scorn to live in this disguise
For such a one as leaves a gentleman
And makes a god of such a cullion
Know sir that I am calld Hortensio
Signior Hortensio I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
I will with you if you be so contented
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever
See how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio
Here is my hand and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more but do forswear her
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatterd her withal
And here I take the unfeigned oath
Never to marry with her though she would entreat
Fie on her see how beastly she doth court him
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn
For me that I may surely keep mine oath
I will be married to a wealthy widow
Ere three days pass which hath as long loved me
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard
And so farewell Signior Lucentio
Kindness in women not their beauteous looks
Shall win my love and so I take my leave
In resolution as I swore before
Exit
Mistress Bianca bless you with such grace
As longeth to a lovers blessed case
Nay I have taen you napping gentle love
And have forsworn you with Hortensio

I faith hell have a lusty widow now
That shall be wood and wedded in a day
God give him joy
Ay and hell tame her

To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
Enter BIONDELLO
O master master I have watchd so long

An ancient angel coming down the hill
Will serve the turn
What is he Biondello
Master a mercatante or a pedant
I know not what but format in apparel
In gait and countenance surely like a father
And what of him Tranio
If he be credulous and trust my tale
Ill make him glad to seem Vincentio
And give assurance to Baptista Minola
As if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love and then let me alone
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
Enter a Pedant
God save you sir
And you sir you are welcome
Travel you far on or are you at the farthest
Sir at the farthest for a week or two
But then up farther and as for as Rome
And so to Tripoli if God lend me life
What countryman I pray
Of Mantua
Of Mantua sir marry God forbid
And come to Padua careless of your life
My life sir how I pray for that goes hard
Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua Know you not the cause
Your ships are stayd at Venice and the duke
For private quarrel twixt your duke and him
Hath publishd and proclaimd it openly
Tis marvel but that you are but newly come
You might have heard it else proclaimd about
Alas sir it is worse for me than so
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them
Well sir to do you courtesy
This will I do and this I will advise you
First tell me have you ever been at Pisa
Ay sir in Pisa have I often been
Pisa renowned for grave citizens
Among them know you one Vincentio
I know him not but I have heard of him
A merchant of incomparable wealth
He is my father sir and sooth to say
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you
Aside  As much as an apple doth an oyster
and all one
To save your life in this extremity
This favour will I do you for his sake
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio
His name and credit shall you undertake
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged
Look that you take upon you as you should
You understand me sir so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city
If this be courtesy sir accept of it
O sir I do and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty
Then go with me to make the matter good
This by the way I let you understand
my father is here lookd for every day
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
Twixt me and one Baptistas daughter here
In all these circumstances Ill instruct you
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you
Exeunt
Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO
No no forsooth I dare not for my life
The more my wrong the more his spite appears
What did he marry me to famish me
Beggars that come unto my fathers door
Upon entreaty have a present aims
If not elsewhere they meet with charity
But I who never knew how to entreat
Nor never needed that I should entreat
Am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed
And that which spites me more than all these wants
He does it under name of perfect love
As who should say if I should sleep or eat
Twere deadly sickness or else present death
I prithee go and get me some repast
I care not what so it be wholesome food
What say you to a neats foot
Tis passing good I prithee let me have it
I fear it is too choleric a meat
How say you to a fat tripe finely broild
I like it well good Grumio fetch it me
I cannot tell I fear tis choleric
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard
A dish that I do love to feed upon
Ay but the mustard is too hot a little
Why then the beef and let the mustard rest
Nay then I will not you shall have the mustard
Or else you get no beef of Grumio
Then both or one or any thing thou wilt
Why then the mustard without the beef
Go get thee gone thou false deluding slave
Beats him
That feedst me with the very name of meat
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
That triumph thus upon my misery
Go get thee gone I say
Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat

Mistress what cheer

Pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me
Here love thou seest how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee
I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks
What not a word Nay then thou lovest it not
And all my pains is sorted to no proof
Here take away this dish
I pray you let it stand
The poorest service is repaid with thanks
And so shall mine before you touch the meat
I thank you sir
Signior Petruchio fie you are to blame
Come mistress Kate Ill bear you company
Aside  Eat it up all Hortensio if thou lovest me
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart
Kate eat apace and now my honey love
Will we return unto thy fathers house
And revel it as bravely as the best
With silken coats and caps and golden rings
With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things
With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery
With amber bracelets beads and all this knavery
What hast thou dined The tailor stays thy leisure
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure
Enter Tailor
Come tailor let us see these ornaments
Lay forth the gown
Enter Haberdasher
What news with you sir
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak
Why this was moulded on a porringer
A velvet dish fie fie tis lewd and filthy
Why tis a cockle or a walnutshell
A knack a toy a trick a babys cap
Away with it come let me have a bigger
Ill have no bigger this doth fit the time
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
When you are gentle you shall have one too
And not till then
Aside  That will not be in haste
Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak
And speak I will I am no child no babe
Your betters have endured me say my mind
And if you cannot best you stop your ears
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart
Or else my heart concealing it will break
And rather than it shall I will be free
Even to the uttermost as I please in words
Why thou sayst true it is a paltry cap
A custardcoffin a bauble a silken pie
I love thee well in that thou likest it not
Love me or love me not I like the cap
And it I will have or I will have none
Exit Haberdasher
Thy gown why ay come tailor let us seet
O mercy God what masquing stuff is here
Whats this a sleeve tis like a demicannon
What up and down carved like an appletart
Heres snip and nip and cut and slish and slash
Like to a censer in a barbers shop
Why what i devils name tailor callst thou this
Aside  I see shes like to have neither cap nor gown
You bid me make it orderly and well
According to the fashion and the time
Marry and did but if you be rememberd
I did not bid you mar it to the time
Go hop me over every kennel home
For you shall hop without my custom sir
Ill none of it hence make your best of it
I never saw a betterfashiond gown
More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me
Why true he means to make a puppet of thee
She says your worship means to make
a puppet of her
O monstrous arrogance Thou liest thou thread

Thou yard threequarters halfyard quarter nail
Thou flea thou nit thou wintercricket thou
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread
Away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant
Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest
I tell thee I that thou hast marrd her gown
Your worship is deceived the gown is made
Just as my master had direction
Grumio gave order how it should be done
I gave him no order I gave him the stuff
But how did you desire it should be made
Marry sir with needle and thread
But did you not request to have it cut
Thou hast faced many things
I have
Face not me thou hast braved many men brave not
me I will neither be faced nor braved I say unto
thee I bid thy master cut out the gown but I did
not bid him cut it to pieces ergo thou liest
Why here is the note of the fashion to testify
Read it
The note lies ins throat if he say I said so
Reads  Imprimis a loosebodied gown
Master if ever I said loosebodied gown sew me in
the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread I said a gown
Proceed
Reads  With a small compassed cape
I confess the cape
Reads  With a trunk sleeve
I confess two sleeves
Reads  The sleeves curiously cut
Ay theres the villany
Error i the bill sir error i the bill
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up again and that Ill prove upon thee
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
This is true that I say an I had thee
in place where thou shouldst know it
I am for thee straight take thou the
bill give me thy meteyard and spare not me
Godamercy Grumio then he shall have no odds
Well sir in brief the gown is not for me
You are i the right sir tis for my mistress
Go take it up unto thy masters use
Villain not for thy life take up my mistress
gown for thy masters use
Why sir whats your conceit in that
O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for
Take up my mistress gown to his masters use
O fie fie fie
Aside  Hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid
Go take it hence be gone and say no more
Tailor Ill pay thee for thy gown tomorrow
Take no unkindness of his hasty words
Away I say commend me to thy master
Exit Tailor
Well come my Kate we will unto your fathers
Even in these honest mean habiliments
Our purses shall be proud our garments poor
For tis the mind that makes the body rich
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds
So honour peereth in the meanest habit
What is the jay more precious than the lark
Because his fathers are more beautiful
Or is the adder better than the eel
Because his painted skin contents the eye
O no good Kate neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array
if thou accountst it shame lay it on me
And therefore frolic we will hence forthwith
To feast and sport us at thy fathers house
Go call my men and let us straight to him
And bring our horses unto Longlane end
There will we mount and thither walk on foot
Lets see I think tis now some seven oclock
And well we may come there by dinnertime
I dare assure you sir tis almost two
And twill be suppertime ere you come there
It shall be seven ere I go to horse
Look what I speak or do or think to do

To gather in some debts my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself
And for the good report I hear of you
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
And she to him to stay him not too long
I am content in a good fathers care
To have him matchd and if you please to like
No worse than I upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestowd
For curious I cannot be with you
Signior Baptista of whom I hear so well
Sir pardon me in what I have to say
Your plainness and your shortness please me well
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him
Or both dissemble deeply their affections
And therefore if you say no more than this
That like a father you will deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower
The match is made and all is done
Your son shall have my daughter with consent
I thank you sir Where then do you know best
We be affied and such assurance taen
As shall with either parts agreement stand
Not in my house Lucentio for you know
Pitchers have ears and I have many servants
Besides old Gremio is hearkening still
And happily we might be interrupted
Then at my lodging an it like you
There doth my father lie and there this night
Well pass the business privately and well
Send for your daughter by your servant here
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently
The worst is this that at so slender warning
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance
It likes me well Biondello hie you home
And bid Bianca make her ready straight
And if you will tell what hath happened
Lucentios father is arrived in Padua
And how shes like to be Lucentios wife
I pray the gods she may with all my heart

Good morrow gentle mistress where away
Tell me sweet Kate and tell me truly too
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman
Such war of white and red within her cheeks
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
As those two eyes become that heavenly face
Fair lovely maid once more good day to thee
Sweet Kate embrace her for her beautys sake
A will make the man mad to make a woman of him
Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet
Whither away or where is thy abode
Happy the parents of so fair a child
Happier the man whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bedfellow
Why how now Kate I hope thou art not mad
This is a man old wrinkled faded witherd
And not a maiden as thou sayst he is
Pardon old father my mistaking eyes
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father
Pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking
Do good old grandsire and withal make known
Which way thou travellest if along with us
We shall be joyful of thy company
Fair sir and you my merry mistress
That with your strange encounter much amazed me
My name is calld Vincentio my dwelling Pisa
And bound I am to Padua there to visit
A son of mine which long I have not seen

Lucentio gentle sir
Happily we met the happier for thy son
And now by law as well as reverend age
I may entitle thee my loving father
The sister to my wife this gentlewoman
Thy son by this hath married Wonder not
Nor be grieved she is of good esteem
Her dowery wealthy and of worthy birth
Beside so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman
Let me embrace with old Vincentio
And wander we to see thy honest son
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous
But is it true or else is it your pleasure
Like pleasant travellers to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake
I do assure thee father so it is
Come go along and see the truth hereof
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous

That faced and braved me in this matter so
Why tell me is not this my Cambio
Cambio is changed into Lucentio
Love wrought these miracles Biancas love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio
While he did bear my countenance in the town
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss
What Tranio did myself enforced him to
Then pardon him sweet father for my sake
Ill slit the villains nose that would have sent
me to the gaol
But do you hear sir have you married my daughter

Enter BAPTISTA VINCENTIO GREMIO the Pedant  LUCENTIO BIANCA PETRUCHIO KATHARINA HORTENSIO  and Widow TRANIO BIONDELLO and GRUMIO the Servingmen with Tranio bringing in a banquet
At last though long our jarring notes agree
And time it is when raging war is done
To smile at scapes and perils overblown
My fair Bianca bid my father welcome
While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine
Brother Petruchio sister Katharina
And thou Hortensio with thy loving widow
Feast with the best and welcome to my house
My banquet is to close our stomachs up
After our great good cheer Pray you sit down
For now we sit to chat as well as eat
Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat
Padua affords this kindness son Petruchio
Padua affords nothing but what is kind
For both our sakes I would that word were true
Now for my life Hortensio fears his widow
Then never trust me if I be afeard
You are very sensible and yet you miss my sense
I mean Hortensio is afeard of you
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round
Roundly replied
Mistress how mean you that
Thus I conceive by him
Conceives by me How likes Hortensio that
My widow says thus she conceives her tale
Very well mended Kiss him for that good widow
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round
I pray you tell me what you meant by that
Your husband being troubled with a shrew
Measures my husbands sorrow by his woe
And now you know my meaning
A very mean meaning
Right I mean you
And I am mean indeed respecting you
To her Kate
To her widow
A hundred marks my Kate does put her down
Thats my office
Spoke like an officer ha to thee lad
Drinks to HORTENSIO
How likes Gremio these quickwitted folks
Believe me sir they butt together well
Head and butt an hastywitted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn
Ay mistress bride hath that awakend you
Ay but not frighted me therefore Ill sleep again
Nay that you shall not since you have begun
Have at you for a bitter jest or two
Am I your bird I mean to shift my bush
And then pursue me as you draw your bow
You are welcome all
Exeunt BIANCA KATHARINA and Widow
She hath prevented me Here Signior Tranio
This bird you aimd at though you hit her not
Therefore a health to all that shot and missd
O sir Lucentio slippd me like his greyhound
Which runs himself and catches for his master
A good swift simile but something currish
Tis well sir that you hunted for yourself
Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay
O ho Petruchio Tranio hits you now
I thank thee for that gird good Tranio
Confess confess hath he not hit you here
A has a little galld me I confess
And as the jest did glance away from me
Tis ten to one it maimd you two outright
Now in good sadness son Petruchio
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all
Well I say no and therefore for assurance
Lets each one send unto his wife
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her
Shall win the wager which we will propose
Content What is the wager
Twenty crowns
Twenty crowns
Ill venture so much of my hawk or hound
But twenty times so much upon my wife
A hundred then
Content
A match tis done
Who shall begin
That will I
Go Biondello bid your mistress come to me
I go
Exit
Son Ill be your half Bianca comes
Ill have no halves Ill bear it all myself
Reenter BIONDELLO
How now what news
Sir my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come
How she is busy and she cannot come
Is that an answer
Ay and a kind one too
Pray God sir your wife send you not a worse
I hope better
Sirrah Biondello go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith
Exit BIONDELLO
O ho entreat her
Nay then she must needs come
I am afraid sir
Do what you can yours will not be entreated
Reenter BIONDELLO
Now wheres my wife
She says you have some goodly jest in hand
She will not come she bids you come to her
Worse and worse she will not come O vile
Intolerable not to be endured
Sirrah Grumio go to your mistress
Say I command her to come to me
Exit GRUMIO
I know her answer
What
She will not
The fouler fortune mine and there an end
Now by my holidame here comes Katharina
Reenter KATARINA
What is your will sir that you send for me
Where is your sister and Hortensios wife
They sit conferring by the parlor fire
Go fetch them hither if they deny to come
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
Away I say and bring them hither straight
Exit KATHARINA
Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
And so it is I wonder what it bodes
Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
And awful rule and right supremacy
And to be short what not thats sweet and happy
Now fair befal thee good Petruchio
The wager thou hast won and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
Another dowry to another daughter
For she is changed as she had never been
Nay I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience
Her newbuilt virtue and obedience
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion
Reenter KATHARINA with BIANCA and Widow
Katharina that cap of yours becomes you not
Off with that bauble throw it underfoot
Lord let me never have a cause to sigh
Till I be brought to such a silly pass
Fie what a foolish duty call you this
I would your duty were as foolish too
The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime
The more fool you for laying on my duty
Katharina I charge thee tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands
Come come youre mocking we will have no telling
Come on I say and first begin with her
She shall not
I say she shall and first begin with her
Fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
To wound thy lord thy king thy governor
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
And in no sense is meet or amiable
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled
Muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty
And while it is so none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land
To watch the night in storms the day in cold
Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love fair looks and true obedience
Too little payment for so great a debt
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband
And when she is froward peevish sullen sour
And not obedient to his honest will
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace
Or seek for rule supremacy and sway
When they are bound to serve love and obey
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts
Come come you froward and unable worms
My mind hath been as big as one of yours
My heart as great my reason haply more
To bandy word for word and frown for frown
But now I see our lances are but straws
Our strength as weak our weakness past compare
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are
Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
And place your hands below your husbands foot
In token of which duty if he please
My hand is ready may it do him ease
Why theres a wench Come on and kiss me Kate
Well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt hat
Tis a good hearing when children are toward
But a harsh hearing when women are froward
Come Kate well to bed
We three are married but you two are sped
To LUCENTIO
Twas I won the wager though you hit the white
And being a winner God give you good night
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
Now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew
Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so

A cry within
A plague upon this howling they are louder than

Reenter SEBASTIAN ANTONIO and GONZALO
Yet again what do you here Shall we give oer

A pox o your throat you bawling blasphemous
incharitable dog
Work you then
Hang cur hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker

Enter Mariners wet
All lost to prayers to prayers all lost

Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any

die a dry death
Exeunt
Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
If by your art my dearest father you have
Put the wild waters in this roar allay them
The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
But that the sea mounting to the welkins cheek
Dashes the fire out O I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer a brave vessel
Who had no doubt some noble creature in her
Dashd all to pieces O the cry did knock
Against my very heart Poor souls they perishd
Had I been any god of power I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallowd and
The fraughting souls within her
Be collected
No more amazement tell your piteous heart
Theres no harm done
O woe the day
No harm
I have done nothing but in care of thee
Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
Art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
Of whence I am nor that I am more better
Than Prospero master of a full poor cell
And thy no greater father
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts
Tis time
I should inform thee farther Lend thy hand
And pluck my magic garment from me So
Lays down his mantle
Lie there my art Wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
The direful spectacle of the wreck which touchd
The very virtue of compassion in thee
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul
No not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heardst cry which thou sawst sink Sit down
For thou must now know farther
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am but stoppd
And left me to a bootless inquisition
Concluding Stay not yet
The hours now come
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear
Obey and be attentive Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell
I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
Out three years old
Certainly sir I can
By what by any other house or person
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance
Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me
Thou hadst and more Miranda But how is it
That this lives in thy mind What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time
If thou rememberst aught ere thou camest here
How thou camest here thou mayst
But that I do not
Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power
Sir are not you my father
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and
She said thou wast my daughter and thy father
Was Duke of Milan and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued
O the heavens
What foul play had we that we came from thence
Or blessed wast we did
Both both my girl
By foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence
But blessedly holp hither
O my heart bleeds
To think o the teen that I have turnd you to
Which is from my remembrance Please you farther
My brother and thy uncle calld Antonio
I pray thee mark methat a brother should
Be so perfidioushe whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed
In dignity and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel those being all my study
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger being transported
And rapt in secret studies Thy false uncle
Dost thou attend me
Sir most heedfully
Being once perfected how to grant suits
How to deny them who to advance and who
To trash for overtopping new created
The creatures that were mine I say or changed em
Or else new formd em having both the key
Of officer and office set all hearts i the state
To what tune pleased his ear that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk
And suckd my verdure out ont Thou attendst not
O good sir I do
I pray thee mark me
I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which but by being so retired
Oerprized all popular rate in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature and my trust
Like a good parent did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was which had indeed no limit
A confidence sans bound He being thus lorded
Not only with what my revenue yielded
Who having into truth by telling of it
Made such a sinner of his memory
To credit his own lie he did believe
He was indeed the duke out o the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty
With all prerogative hence his ambition growing
Dost thou hear
Your tale sir would cure deafness
To have no screen between this part he playd
And him he playd it for he needs will be
Absolute Milan Me poor man my library
Was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable confederates
So dry he was for swaywi the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute do him homage
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbowdalas poor Milan
To most ignoble stooping
O the heavens
Mark his condition and the event then tell me
If this might be a brother
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother
Good wombs have borne bad sons
Now the condition
The King of Naples being an enemy
To me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit
Which was that he in lieu o the premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother whereon
A treacherous army levied one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan and i the dead of darkness
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self
Alack for pity
I not remembering how I cried out then
Will cry it oer again it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes tot
Hear a little further
And then Ill bring thee to the present business
Which nows upons without the which this story
Were most impertinent
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us
Well demanded wench
My tale provokes that question Dear they durst not
So dear the love my people bore me nor set
A mark so bloody on the business but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends
In few they hurried us aboard a bark
Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat not riggd
Nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
Instinctively had quit it there they hoist us
To cry to the sea that roard to us to sigh
To the winds whose pity sighing back again
Did us but loving wrong
Alack what trouble
Was I then to you
O a cherubim
Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile
Infused with a fortitude from heaven
When I have deckd the sea with drops full salt
Under my burthen groand which raised in me
An undergoing stomach to bear up
Against what should ensue
How came we ashore
By Providence divine
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo
Out of his charity being then appointed
Master of this design did give us with
Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
Which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
Knowing I loved my books he furnishd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom
Would I might
But ever see that man
Now I arise
Resumes his mantle
Sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow
Here in this island we arrived and here
Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful
Heavens thank you fort And now I pray you sir
For still tis beating in my mind your reason
For raising this seastorm
Know thus far forth
By accident most strange bountiful Fortune
Now my dear lady hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star whose influence
If now I court not but omit my fortunes
Will ever after droop Here cease more questions
Thou art inclined to sleep tis a good dulness
And give it way I know thou canst not choose
MIRANDA sleeps
Come away servant come I am ready now
Approach my Ariel come
Enter ARIEL
All hail great master grave sir hail I come
To answer thy best pleasure bet to fly
To swim to dive into the fire to ride
On the curld clouds to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality
Hast thou spirit
Performd to point the tempest that I bade thee
To every article
I boarded the kings ship now on the beak
Now in the waist the deck in every cabin
I flamed amazement sometime Ild divide
And burn in many places on the topmast
The yards and bowsprit would I flame distinctly
Then meet and join Joves lightnings the precursors
O the dreadful thunderclaps more momentary
And sightoutrunning were not the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
Yea his dread trident shake
My brave spirit
Who was so firm so constant that this coil
Would not infect his reason
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and playd
Some tricks of desperation All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel
Then all afire with me the kings son Ferdinand
With hair upstaringthen like reeds not hair
Was the first man that leapd cried Hell is empty
And all the devils are here
Why thats my spirit
But was not this nigh shore
Close by my master
But are they Ariel safe
Not a hair perishd
On their sustaining garments not a blemish
But fresher than before and as thou badest me
In troops I have dispersed them bout the isle
The kings son have I landed by himself
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting
His arms in this sad knot
Of the kings ship
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o the fleet
Safely in harbour
Is the kings ship in the deep nook where once
Thou calldst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the stillvexd Bermoothes there shes hid
The mariners all under hatches stowd
Who with a charm joind to their sufferd labour
I have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet
Which I dispersed they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote
Bound sadly home for Naples
Supposing that they saw the kings ship wreckd
And his great person perish
Ariel thy charge
What is the time o the day
Past the mid season
At least two glasses The time twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously
Is there more toil Since thou dost give me pains
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised
Which is not yet performd me
How now moody
What ist thou canst demand
My liberty
Before the time be out no more
I prithee
Remember I have done thee worthy service
Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served
Without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise
To bate me a full year
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee
No
Thou dost and thinkst it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep
To run upon the sharp wind of the north
To do me business in the veins o the earth
When it is baked with frost
I do not sir
Thou liest malignant thing Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her
No sir
Thou hast Where was she born speak tell me
Sir in Argier
O was she so I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been
Which thou forgetst This damnd witch Sycorax
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing from Argier
Thou knowst was banishd for one thing she did
They would not take her life Is not this true
Ay sir
This blueeyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors Thou my slave
As thou reportst thyself wast then her servant
And for thou wast a spirit too delicate
Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage
Into a cloven pine within which rift
Imprisond thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years within which space she died
And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as millwheels strike Then was this island
Save for the son that she did litter here
A freckled whelp hagbornnot honourd with
A human shape
Yes Caliban her son
Dull thing I say so he that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service Thou best knowst
What torment I did find thee in thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears it was a torment
To lay upon the damnd which Sycorax
Could not again undo it was mine art
When I arrived and heard thee that made gape
The pine and let thee out
I thank thee master
If thou more murmurst I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howld away twelve winters
Pardon master
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently
Do so and after two days
I will discharge thee
Thats my noble master
What shall I do say what what shall I do
Go make thyself like a nymph o the sea be subject
To no sight but thine and mine invisible
To every eyeball else Go take this shape
And hither come int go hence with diligence
Exit ARIEL
Awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well Awake
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me
Shake it off Come on
Well visit Caliban my slave who never
Yields us kind answer
Tis a villain sir
I do not love to look on
But as tis
We cannot miss him he does make our fire
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us What ho slave Caliban
Thou earth thou speak
Within  Theres wood enough within
Come forth I say theres other business for thee
Come thou tortoise when
Reenter ARIEL like a waternymph
Fine apparition My quaint Ariel
Hark in thine ear
My lord it shall be done
Exit
Thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam come forth
Enter CALIBAN
As wicked dew as eer my mother brushd
With ravens feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both a southwest blow on ye
And blister you all oer
For this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps
Sidestitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins
Shall for that vast of night that they may work
All exercise on thee thou shalt be pinchd
As thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made em
I must eat my dinner
This islands mine by Sycorax my mother
Which thou takest from me When thou camest first
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me
Water with berries int and teach me how
To name the bigger light and how the less
That burn by day and night and then I loved thee
And showd thee all the qualities o the isle
The fresh springs brinepits barren place and fertile
Cursed be I that did so All the charms
Of Sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
For I am all the subjects that you have
Which first was mine own king and here you sty me
In this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
The rest o the island
Thou most lying slave
Whom stripes may move not kindness I have used thee
Filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee
In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child
O ho O ho wouldt had been done
Thou didst prevent me I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans
Abhorred slave
Which any print of goodness wilt not take
Being capable of all ill I pitied thee
Took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
One thing or other when thou didst not savage
Know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish I endowd thy purposes
With words that made them known But thy vile race
Though thou didst learn had that int which
good natures
Could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock
Who hadst deserved more than a prison
You taught me language and my profit ont
Is I know how to curse The red plague rid you
For learning me your language
Hagseed hence
Fetch us in fuel and be quick thourt best
To answer other business Shrugst thou malice
If thou neglectst or dost unwillingly
What I command Ill rack thee with old cramps
Fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at thy din
No pray thee
Aside
I must obey his art is of such power
It would control my dams god Setebos
and make a vassal of him
So slave hence
Exit CALIBAN
Reenter ARIEL invisible playing and singing FERDINAND following
ARIELS song
Come unto these yellow sands
And then take hands
Courtsied when you have and kissd
The wild waves whist
Foot it featly here and there
And sweet sprites the burthen bear
Hark hark
Burthen dispersedly within
The watchdogs bark
Burthen Bowwow
Hark hark I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
Cry Cockadiddledow
Where should this music be i the air or the earth
It sounds no more and sure it waits upon
Some god o the island Sitting on a bank
Weeping again the king my fathers wreck
This music crept by me upon the waters
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air thence I have followd it
Or it hath drawn me rather But tis gone
No it begins again
ARIEL sings
Full fathom five thy father lies
Of his bones are coral made
Those are pearls that were his eyes
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a seachange
Into something rich and strange
Seanymphs hourly ring his knell
Burthen Dingdong
Hark now I hear themDingdong bell
The ditty does remember my drownd father
This is no mortal business nor no sound
That the earth owes I hear it now above me
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond
What ist a spirit
Lord how it looks about Believe me sir
It carries a brave form But tis a spirit
No wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have such This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck and but hes something staind
With grief thats beautys canker thou mightst call him
A goodly person he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find em
I might call him
A thing divine for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble
Aside It goes on I see
As my soul prompts it Spirit fine spirit Ill free thee
Within two days for this
Most sure the goddess
On whom these airs attend Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here my prime request
Which I do last pronounce is O you wonder
If you be maid or no
No wonder sir
But certainly a maid
My language heavens
I am the best of them that speak this speech
Were I but where tis spoken
How the best
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee
A single thing as I am now that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples He does hear me
And that he does I weep myself am Naples
Who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld
The king my father wreckd
Alack for mercy
Yes faith and all his lords the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain
AsideThe Duke of Milan
And his more braver daughter could control thee
If now twere fit to dot At the first sight
They have changed eyes Delicate Ariel
Ill set thee free for this
To FERDINAND
A word good sir
I fear you have done yourself some wrong a word
Why speaks my father so ungently This
Is the third man that eer I saw the first
That eer I sighd for pity move my father
To be inclined my way
O if a virgin
And your affection not gone forth Ill make you
The queen of Naples
Soft sir one word more
Aside
They are both in eithers powers but this swift business
I must uneasy make lest too light winning
Make the prize light
To FERDINAND
One word more I charge thee
That thou attend me thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy to win it
From me the lord ont
No as I am a man
Theres nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
If the ill spirit have so fair a house
Good things will strive to dwell witht
Follow me
Speak not you for him hes a traitor Come
Ill manacle thy neck and feet together
Seawater shalt thou drink thy food shall be
The freshbrook muscles witherd roots and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled Follow
No
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power
Draws and is charmed from moving
O dear father
Make not too rash a trial of him for
Hes gentle and not fearful
What I say
My foot my tutor Put thy sword up traitor
Who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience
Is so possessd with guilt come from thy ward
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop
Beseech you father
Hence hang not on my garments
Sir have pity
Ill be his surety
Silence one word more
Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee What
An advocate for an imposter hush
Thou thinkst there is no more such shapes as he
Having seen but him and Caliban foolish wench
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels
My affections
Are then most humble I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man
Come on obey
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them
So they are
My spirits as in a dream are all bound up
My fathers loss the weakness which I feel
The wreck of all my friends nor this mans threats
To whom I am subdued are but light to me
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid all corners else o the earth
Let liberty make use of space enough
Have I in such a prison
Aside                It works
To FERDINAND
Come on
Thou hast done well fine Ariel
To FERDINAND
Follow me
To ARIEL
Hark what thou else shalt do me
Be of comfort
My fathers of a better nature sir
Than he appears by speech this is unwonted
Which now came from him
Thou shalt be free
All points of my command
To the syllable
Come follow Speak not for him
Exeunt
Enter ALONSO SEBASTIAN ANTONIO GONZALO ADRIAN FRANCISCO and others
Beseech you sir be merry you have cause
So have we all of joy for our escape
Is much beyond our loss Our hint of woe
Is common every day some sailors wife
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
I mean our preservation few in millions
Can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort
Prithee peace
He receives comfort like cold porridge
The visitor will not give him oer so
Look hes winding up the watch of his wit
by and by it will strike
Sir
One tell
When every grief is entertaind thats offerd
Comes to the entertainer
A dollar
Dolour comes to him indeed you
have spoken truer than you purposed
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should
Therefore my lord
Fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
I prithee spare
Well I have done but yet
He will be talking
Which of he or Adrian for a good
wager first begins to crow
The old cock
The cockerel
Done The wager
A laughter
A match
Though this island seem to be desert
Ha ha ha So youre paid
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
Yet
Yet
He could not misst
It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate
temperance
Temperance was a delicate wench
Ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly
As if it had lungs and rotten ones
Or as twere perfumed by a fen
Here is everything advantageous to life
True save means to live
Of that theres none or little
How lush and lusty the grass looks how green
The ground indeed is tawny
With an eye of green int
He misses not much
No he doth but mistake the truth totally
But the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost
beyond credit
As many vouched rarities are
That our garments being as they were drenched in
the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses being rather newdyed than stained with
salt water
If but one of his pockets could speak would it not
say he lies
Ay or very falsely pocket up his report
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric at the marriage of
the kings fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen
Not since widow Didos time
Widow a pox o that How came that widow in
widow Dido
What if he had said widower AEneas too Good Lord
how you take it
Widow Dido said you you make me study of that
she was of Carthage not of Tunis
This Tunis sir was Carthage
Carthage
I assure you Carthage
His word is more than the miraculous harp he hath
raised the wall and houses too
What impossible matter will he make easy next
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
forth more islands
Ay
Why in good time
Sir we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter who is now queen
And the rarest that eer came there
Bate I beseech you widow Dido
O widow Dido ay widow Dido
Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it I mean in a sort
That sort was well fished for
When I wore it at your daughters marriage
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense Would I had never
Married my daughter there for coming thence
My son is lost and in my rate she too
Who is so far from Italy removed
I neer again shall see her O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee
Sir he may live
I saw him beat the surges under him
And ride upon their backs he trod the water
Whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him his bold head
Bove the contentious waves he kept and oard
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore that oer his waveworn basis bowd
As stooping to relieve him I not doubt
He came alive to land
No no hes gone
Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter
But rather lose her to an African
Where she at least is banishd from your eye
Who hath cause to wet the grief ont
Prithee peace
You were kneeld to and importuned otherwise
By all of us and the fair soul herself
Weighd between loathness and obedience at
Which end o the beam should bow We have lost your
son
I fear for ever Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business making
Than we bring men to comfort them
The faults your own
So is the dearst o the loss
My lord Sebastian
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in you rub the sore
When you should bring the plaster
Very well
And most chirurgeonly
It is foul weather in us all good sir
When you are cloudy
Foul weather
Very foul
Had I plantation of this isle my lord
Held sowt with nettleseed
Or docks or mallows
And were the king ont what would I do
Scape being drunk for want of wine
I the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things for no kind of traffic
Would I admit no name of magistrate
Letters should not be known riches poverty
Bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
No use of metal corn or wine or oil
No occupation all men idle all
And women too but innocent and pure
No sovereignty
Yet he would be king ont
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour treason felony
Sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
Would I not have but nature should bring forth
Of its own kind all foison all abundance
To feed my innocent people
No marrying mong his subjects
None man all idle whores and knaves
I would with such perfection govern sir
To excel the golden age
God save his majesty
Long live Gonzalo
Anddo you mark me sir
Prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me
I do well believe your highness and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing
Twas you we laughed at
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still
What a blow was there given
An it had not fallen flatlong
You are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift
the moon out of her sphere if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing
Enter ARIEL invisible playing solemn music
We would so and then go a batfowling
Nay good my lord be not angry
No I warrant you I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly Will you laugh
me asleep for I am very heavy
Go sleep and hear us
All sleep except ALONSO SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
What all so soon asleep I wish mine eyes
Would with themselves shut up my thoughts I find
They are inclined to do so
Please you sir
Do not omit the heavy offer of it
It seldom visits sorrow when it doth
It is a comforter
We two my lord
Will guard your person while you take your rest
And watch your safety
Thank you Wondrous heavy
ALONSO sleeps Exit ARIEL
What a strange drowsiness possesses them
It is the quality o the climate
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink I find not
Myself disposed to sleep
Nor I my spirits are nimble
They fell together all as by consent
They droppd as by a thunderstroke What might
Worthy Sebastian O what mightNo more
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face
What thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head
What art thou waking
Do you not hear me speak
I do and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speakst
Out of thy sleep What is it thou didst say
This is a strange repose to be asleep
With eyes wide open standing speaking moving
And yet so fast asleep
Noble Sebastian
Thou letst thy fortune sleepdie rather winkst
Whiles thou art waking
Thou dost snore distinctly
Theres meaning in thy snores
I am more serious than my custom you
Must be so too if heed me which to do
Trebles thee oer
Well I am standing water
Ill teach you how to flow
Do so to ebb
Hereditary sloth instructs me
O
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
You more invest it Ebbing men indeed
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth
Prithee say on
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee and a birth indeed
Which throes thee much to yield
Thus sir
Although this lord of weak remembrance this
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earthd hath here almost persuade
For hes a spirit of persuasion only
Professes to persuadethe king his sons alive
Tis as impossible that hes undrownd
And he that sleeps here swims
I have no hope
That hes undrownd
O out of that no hope
What great hope have you no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
But doubt discovery there Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drownd
Hes gone
Then tell me
Whos the next heir of Naples
Claribel
She that is queen of Tunis she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond mans life she that from Naples
Can have no note unless the sun were post
The man i the moons too slowtill newborn chins
Be rough and razorable she thatfrom whom
We all were seaswallowd though some cast again
Whereof whats past is prologue what to come
In yours and my discharge
What stuff is this how say you
Tis true my brothers daughters queen of Tunis
So is she heir of Naples twixt which regions
There is some space
A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples Keep in Tunis
And let Sebastian wake Say this were death
That now hath seized them why they were no worse
Than now they are There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat O that you bore
The mind that I do what a sleep were this
For your advancement Do you understand me
Methinks I do
And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune
I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero
True
And look how well my garments sit upon me
Much feater than before my brothers servants
Were then my fellows now they are my men
But for your conscience
Ay sir where lies that if twere a kibe
Twould put me to my slipper but I feel not
This deity in my bosom twenty consciences
That stand twixt me and Milan candied be they
And melt ere they molest Here lies your brother
No better than the earth he lies upon
If he were that which now hes like thats dead
Whom I with this obedient steel three inches of it
Can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel this Sir Prudence who
Should not upbraid our course For all the rest
Theyll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
Theyll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour
Thy case dear friend
Shall be my precedent as thou gotst Milan
Ill come by Naples Draw thy sword one stroke
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest
And I the king shall love thee
Draw together
And when I rear my hand do you the like
To fall it on Gonzalo
O but one word
They talk apart
Reenter ARIEL invisible
My master through his art foresees the danger
That you his friend are in and sends me forth
For else his project diesto keep them living
Sings in GONZALOs ear
While you here do snoring lie
Openeyed conspiracy
His time doth take
If of life you keep a care
Shake off slumber and beware
Awake awake
Then let us both be sudden
Now good angels
Preserve the king
They wake
Why how now ho awake Why are you drawn
Wherefore this ghastly looking
Whats the matter
Whiles we stood here securing your repose
Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
Like bulls or rather lions didt not wake you
It struck mine ear most terribly
I heard nothing
O twas a din to fright a monsters ear
To make an earthquake sure it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions
Heard you this Gonzalo
Upon mine honour sir I heard a humming
And that a strange one too which did awake me
I shaked you sir and cried as mine eyes opend
I saw their weapons drawn there was a noise
Thats verily Tis best we stand upon our guard
Or that we quit this place lets draw our weapons
Lead off this ground and lets make further search
For my poor son
Heavens keep him from these beasts
For he is sure i the island
Lead away
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done
So king go safely on to seek thy son
Exeunt
Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood A noise of thunder heard
All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him
By inchmeal a disease His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse But theyll nor pinch
Fright me with urchinshows pitch me i the mire
Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark
Out of my way unless he bid em but
For every trifle are they set upon me
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness
Enter TRINCULO
Lo now lo
Here comes a spirit of his and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly Ill fall flat
Perchance he will not mind me
Heres neither bush nor shrub to bear off
any weather at all and another storm brewing
I hear it sing i the wind yond same black
cloud yond huge one looks like a foul
bombard that would shed his liquor If it
should thunder as it did before I know not
where to hide my head yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls What have we

beggar they will lazy out ten to see a dead
Indian Legged like a man and his fins like
arms Warm o my troth I do now let loose

thunderbolt
Thunder
Alas the storm is come again my best way is to
creep under his gaberdine there is no other
shelter hereabouts misery acquaints a man with
strange bedfellows I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past

The gunner and his mate
Loved Mall Meg and Marian and Margery

Yet a tailor might scratch her whereer she did itch
Then to sea boys and let her go hang
This is a scurvy tune too but heres my comfort

O brave monster Lead the way
Exeunt
Enter FERDINAND bearing a log
There be some sports are painful and their labour
Delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious but
The mistress which I serve quickens whats dead
And makes my labours pleasures O she is
Ten times more gentle than her fathers crabbed
And hes composed of harshness I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up
Upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
Had never like executor I forget
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
Most busy lest when I do it
Enter MIRANDA and PROSPERO at a distance unseen
Alas now pray you
Work not so hard I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoind to pile
Pray set it down and rest you when this burns
Twill weep for having wearied you My father
Is hard at study pray now rest yourself
Hes safe for these three hours
O most dear mistress
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do
If youll sit down
Ill bear your logs the while pray give me that
Ill carry it to the pile
No precious creature
I had rather crack my sinews break my back
Than you should such dishonour undergo
While I sit lazy by
It would become me
As well as it does you and I should do it
With much more ease for my good will is to it
And yours it is against
Poor worm thou art infected
This visitation shows it
You look wearily
No noble mistresstis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night I do beseech you
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers
What is your name
MirandaO my father
I have broke your hest to say so
Admired Miranda
Indeed the top of admiration worth
Whats dearest to the world Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
Have I liked several women never any
With so fun soul but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
And put it to the foil but you O you
So perfect and so peerless are created
Of every creatures best
I do not know
One of my sex no womans face remember
Save from my glass mine own nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you good friend
And my dear father how features are abroad
I am skilless of but by my modesty
The jewel in my dower I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you
Nor can imagination form a shape
Besides yourself to like of But I prattle
Something too wildly and my fathers precepts
I therein do forget
I am in my condition
A prince Miranda I do think a king
I would not soand would no more endure
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The fleshfly blow my mouth Hear my soul speak
The very instant that I saw you did
My heart fly to your service there resides
To make me slave to it and for your sake
Am I this patient logman
Do you love me
O heaven O earth bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true if hollowly invert
What best is boded me to mischief I
Beyond all limit of what else i the world
Do love prize honour you
I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of
Fair encounter
Of two most rare affections Heavens rain grace
On that which breeds between em
Wherefore weep you
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
What I desire to give and much less take
What I shall die to want But this is trifling
And all the more it seeks to hide itself
The bigger bulk it shows Hence bashful cunning
And prompt me plain and holy innocence
I am your wife if you will marry me
If not Ill die your maid to be your fellow
You may deny me but Ill be your servant
Whether you will or no
My mistress dearest
And I thus humble ever
My husband then
Ay with a heart as willing
As bondage eer of freedom heres my hand
And mine with my heart int and now farewell
Till half an hour hence
A thousand thousand
Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally
So glad of this as they I cannot be
Who are surprised withal but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more Ill to my book
For yet ere suppertime must I perform
Much business appertaining
Exit
Enter CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO

Thou liest most ignorant monster I am in case to
justle a constable Why thou deboshed fish thou

Lo lo again bite him to death I prithee
Trinculo keep a good tongue in your head if you

I thank my noble lord Wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee
Marry will Ikneel and repeat it I will stand
and so shall Trinculo
Enter ARIEL invisible
As I told thee before I am subject to a tyrant a
sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island
Thou liest
Thou liest thou jesting monkey thou I would my
valiant master would destroy thee I do not lie
Trinculo if you trouble him any more ins tale by
this hand I will supplant some of your teeth
Why I said nothing
Mum then and no more Proceed
I say by sorcery he got this isle
From me he got it if thy greatness will
Revenge it on himfor I know thou darest
But this thing dare not
Thats most certain
Thou shalt be lord of it and Ill serve thee
How now shall this be compassed
Canst thou bring me to the party
Yea yea my lord Ill yield him thee asleep
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead
Thou liest thou canst not
What a pied ninnys this Thou scurvy patch
I do beseech thy greatness give him blows
And take his bottle from him when thats gone
He shall drink nought but brine for Ill not show him
Where the quick freshes are

by this hand Ill turn my mercy out o doors
and make a stockfish of thee
Why what did I I did nothing Ill go farther

Beats TRINCULO
As you like this give me the lie another time
I did not give the lie Out o your
wits and bearing too A pox o your bottle

your monster and the devil take your fingers
Ha ha ha
Now forward with your tale Prithee stand farther
off
Beat him enough after a little time
Ill beat him too
Stand farther Come proceed
Why as I told thee tis a custom with him
I th afternoon to sleep there thou mayst brain him
Having first seized his books or with a log
Batter his skull or paunch him with a stake
Or cut his wezand with thy knife Remember
First to possess his books for without them
Hes but a sot as I am nor hath not
One spirit to command they all do hate him
As rootedly as I Burn but his books
He has brave utensilsfor so he calls them
Which when he has a house hell deck withal
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter he himself
Calls her a nonpareil I never saw a woman
But only Sycorax my dam and she
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As greatst does least
Is it so brave a lass
Ay lord she will become thy bed I warrant
And bring thee forth brave brood
Monster I will kill this man his daughter and I
will be king and queensave our gracesand
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys Dost thou
like the plot Trinculo
Excellent
Give me thy hand I am sorry I beat thee but
while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head
Within this half hour will he be asleep
Wilt thou destroy him then
Ay on mine honour
This will I tell my master
Thou makest me merry I am full of pleasure
Let us be jocund will you troll the catch
You taught me but whileere
At thy request monster I will do reason any
reason Come on Trinculo let us sing
Sings
Flout em and scout em
And scout em and flout em
Thought is free
Thats not the tune
Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
What is this same
This is the tune of our catch played by the picture
of Nobody
If thou beest a man show thyself in thy likeness
if thou beest a devil taket as thou list
O forgive me my sins
He that dies pays all debts I defy thee Mercy upon us
Art thou afeard
No monster not I
Be not afeard the isle is full of noises
Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears and sometime voices
That if I then had waked after long sleep
Will make me sleep again and then in dreaming
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me that when I waked
I cried to dream again
This will prove a brave kingdom to me where I shall
have my music for nothing
When Prospero is destroyed
That shall be by and by I remember the story
The sound is going away lets follow it and
after do our work
Lead monster well follow I would I could see
this tabourer he lays it on
Wilt come Ill follow Stephano
Exeunt
Enter ALONSO SEBASTIAN ANTONIO GONZALO ADRIAN FRANCISCO and others
Byr lakin I can go no further sir
My old bones ache heres a maze trod indeed
Through forthrights and meanders By your patience
I needs must rest me
Old lord I cannot blame thee
Who am myself attachd with weariness
To the dulling of my spirits sit down and rest
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
No longer for my flatterer he is drownd
Whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land Well let him go
Aside to SEBASTIAN  I am right glad that hes so
out of hope
Do not for one repulse forego the purpose
That you resolved to effect
Aside to ANTONIO  The next advantage
Will we take throughly
Aside to SEBASTIAN  Let it be tonight
For now they are oppressd with travel they
Will not nor cannot use such vigilance
As when they are fresh
Aside to ANTONIO  I say tonight no more
Solemn and strange music
What harmony is this My good friends hark
Marvellous sweet music
Give us kind keepers heavens What were these
A living drollery Now I will believe
That there are unicorns that in Arabia
There is one tree the phoenix throne one phoenix
At this hour reigning there
Ill believe both
And what does else want credit come to me
And Ill be sworn tis true travellers neer did
lie
Though fools at home condemn em
If in Naples
I should report this now would they believe me
If I should say I saw such islanders
For certes these are people of the island
Who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
Their manners are more gentlekind than of
Our human generation you shall find
Many nay almost any
Aside              Honest lord
Thou hast said well for some of you there present
Are worse than devils
I cannot too much muse
Such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
Although they want the use of tongue a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse
AsidePraise in departing
They vanishd strangely
No matter since
They have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
Willt please you taste of what is here
Not I
Faith sir you need not fear When we were boys
Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Dewlappd like bulls whose throats had hanging at em
Wallets of flesh or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
Each putterout of five for one will bring us
Good warrant of
I will stand to and feed
Although my last no matter since I feel
The best is past Brother my lord the duke
Stand to and do as we
Thunder and lightning Enter ARIEL like a  harpy claps his wings upon the table and with a quaint device the banquet vanishes
You are three men of sin whom Destiny
That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is int the neversurfeited sea
Hath caused to belch up you and on this island
Where man doth not inhabit you mongst men
Being most unfit to live I have made you mad
And even with suchlike valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves
ALONSO SEBASTIAN  and c draw their swords
You fools I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate the elements
Of whom your swords are temperd may as well
Wound the loud winds or with bemockdat stabs
Kill the stillclosing waters as diminish
One dowle thats in my plume my fellowministers
Are like invulnerable If you could hurt
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
And will not be uplifted But remember
For thats my business to youthat you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero
Exposed unto the sea which hath requit it
Him and his innocent child for which foul deed
The powers delaying not forgetting have
Incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures
Against your peace Thee of thy son Alonso
They have bereft and do pronounce by me
Lingering perdition worse than any death
Can be at once shall step by step attend
You and your ways whose wraths to guard you from
Which here in this most desolate isle else falls
Upon your headsis nothing but heartsorrow
And a clear life ensuing
He vanishes in thunder then to soft music  enter the Shapes again and dance with mocks and mows and carrying out the table
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Performd my Ariel a grace it had devouring
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
In what thou hadst to say so with good life
And observation strange my meaner ministers
Their several kinds have done My high charms work
And these mine enemies are all knit up
And in these fits I leave them while I visit
Young Ferdinand whom they suppose is drownd
And his and mine loved darling
Exit above
I the name of something holy sir why stand you
In this strange stare
O it is monstrous monstrous
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it
The winds did sing it to me and the thunder
That deep and dreadful organpipe pronounced
The name of Prosper it did bass my trespass
Therefore my son i the ooze is bedded and
Ill seek him deeper than eer plummet sounded
And with him there lie mudded
Exit
But one fiend at a time
Ill fight their legions oer
Ill be thy second
Exeunt SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
All three of them are desperate their great guilt
Like poison given to work a great time after
Now gins to bite the spirits I do beseech you
That are of suppler joints follow them swiftly
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to
Follow I pray you
Exeunt
Enter PROSPERO FERDINAND and MIRANDA
If I have too austerely punishd you
Your compensation makes amends for I
Have given you here a third of mine own life
Or that for which I live who once again
I tender to thy hand all thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love and thou
Hast strangely stood the test here afore Heaven
I ratify this my rich gift O Ferdinand
Do not smile at me that I boast her off
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
And make it halt behind her
I do believe it
Against an oracle
Then as my gift and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchased take my daughter but
If thou dost break her virginknot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be ministerd
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
Soureyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both therefore take heed
As Hymens lamps shall light you
As I hope
For quiet days fair issue and long life
With such love as tis now the murkiest den
The most opportune place the strongst suggestion
Our worser genius can shall never melt
Mine honour into lust to take away
The edge of that days celebration
When I shall think or Phoebus steeds are founderd
Or Night kept chaind below
Fairly spoke
Sit then and talk with her she is thine own
What Ariel my industrious servant Ariel
Enter ARIEL
What would my potent master here I am
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform and I must use you
In such another trick Go bring the rabble
Oer whom I give thee power here to this place
Incite them to quick motion for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Some vanity of mine art it is my promise
And they expect it from me
Presently
Ay with a twink
Before you can say come and go
And breathe twice and cry so so
Each one tripping on his toe
Will be here with mop and mow
Do you love me master no
Dearly my delicate Ariel Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call
Well I conceive
Exit
Look thou be true do not give dalliance
Too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw
To the fire i the blood be more abstemious
Or else good night your vow
I warrant you sir
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver
Well
Now come my Ariel bring a corollary
Rather than want a spirit appear and pertly
No tongue all eyes be silent
Soft music
Enter IRIS
Ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas
Of wheat rye barley vetches oats and pease
Thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep
And flat meads thatchd with stover them to keep
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves
Being lasslorn thy poleclipt vineyard
And thy seamarge sterile and rockyhard
Where thou thyself dost airthe queen o the sky
Whose watery arch and messenger am I
Bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace
Here on this grassplot in this very place
To come and sport her peacocks fly amain
Approach rich Ceres her to entertain
Enter CERES
Hail manycolourd messenger that neer
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
Diffusest honeydrops refreshing showers
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
My bosky acres and my unshrubbd down
Rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen
Summond me hither to this shortgrassd green
And some donation freely to estate
On the blest lovers
Tell me heavenly bow
If Venus or her son as thou dost know
Do now attend the queen Since they did plot
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got
Her and her blind boys scandald company
I have forsworn
Of her society
Be not afraid I met her deity
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
Dovedrawn with her Here thought they to have done
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid
Whose vows are that no bedright shall be paid
Till Hymens torch be lighted but vain
Marss hot minion is returned again
Her waspishheaded son has broke his arrows
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
And be a boy right out
Highst queen of state
Great Juno comes I know her by her gait
Enter JUNO
How does my bounteous sister Go with me
To bless this twain that they may prosperous be
And honourd in their issue
They sing
Honour riches marriageblessing
Long continuance and increasing
Hourly joys be still upon you
Juno sings her blessings upon you
Earths increase foison plenty
Barns and garners never empty
Vines and clustering bunches growing
Plants with goodly burthen bowing
Spring come to you at the farthest
In the very end of harvest
Scarcity and want shall shun you
Ceres blessing so is on you
This is a most majestic vision and
Harmoniously charmingly May I be bold
To think these spirits
Spirits which by mine art
My present fancies
Let me live here ever
So rare a wonderd father and a wife
Makes this place Paradise
Juno and Ceres whisper and send Iris on employment
Sweet now silence
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously
Theres something else to do hush and be mute
Or else our spell is marrd
You nymphs calld Naiads of the windring brooks
With your sedged crowns and everharmless looks
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
Answer your summons Juno does command
Come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate
Enter certain Nymphs
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary
Come hither from the furrow and be merry
Make holiday your ryestraw hats put on
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing
Enter certain Reapers properly habited they  join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance  towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts  suddenly and speaks after which to a  strange hollow and confused noise they heavily vanish
Aside  I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life the minute of their plot
Is almost come
To the Spirits
Well done avoid no more
This is strange your fathers in some passion
That works him strongly
Never till this day
Saw I him touchd with anger so distemperd
You do look my son in a moved sort
As if you were dismayd be cheerful sir
As I foretold you were all spirits and
Are melted into air into thin air
And like the baseless fabric of this vision
The cloudcappd towers the gorgeous palaces
The solemn temples the great globe itself
Ye all which it inherit shall dissolve
And like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind We are such stuff
As dreams are made on and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep Sir I am vexd
Bear with my weakness my brain is troubled
Be not disturbd with my infirmity
If you be pleased retire into my cell
And there repose a turn or two Ill walk
To still my beating mind
We wish your peace
Exeunt
Come with a thought I thank thee Ariel come
Enter ARIEL
Thy thoughts I cleave to Whats thy pleasure
Spirit
We must prepare to meet with Caliban
Ay my commander when I presented Ceres
I thought to have told thee of it but I feard
Lest I might anger thee
Say again where didst thou leave these varlets
I told you sir they were redhot with drinking
So fun of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces beat the ground
For kissing of their feet yet always bending
Towards their project Then I beat my tabour
At which like unbackd colts they prickd
their ears
Advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses
As they smelt music so I charmd their ears
That calflike they my lowing followd through
Toothd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns
Which entered their frail shins at last I left them
I the filthymantled pool beyond your cell
There dancing up to the chins that the foul lake
Oerstunk their feet
This was well done my bird
Thy shape invisible retain thou still
The trumpery in my house go bring it hither
For stale to catch these thieves
I go I go
Exit
A devil a born devil on whose nature
Nurture can never stick on whom my pains
Humanely taken all all lost quite lost
And as with age his body uglier grows
So his mind cankers I will plague them all
Even to roaring
Reenter ARIEL loaden with glistering apparel  and c
Come hang them on this line
PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible Enter CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO all wet
Pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall we now are near his cell
Monster your fairy which you say is
a harmless fairy has done little better than
played the Jack with us
Monster I do smell all horsepiss at
which my nose is in great indignation
So is mine Do you hear monster If I should take
a displeasure against you look you
Thou wert but a lost monster
Good my lord give me thy favour still
Be patient for the prize Ill bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance therefore speak softly
Alls hushd as midnight yet
Ay but to lose our bottles in the pool
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that
monster but an infinite loss
Thats more to me than my wetting yet this is your
harmless fairy monster
I will fetch off my bottle though I be oer ears
for my labour
Prithee my king be quiet Seest thou here
This is the mouth o the cell no noise and enter
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever and I thy Caliban
For aye thy footlicker
Give me thy hand I do begin to have bloody thoughts
O king Stephano O peer O worthy Stephano look
what a wardrobe here is for thee
Let it alone thou fool it is but trash
O ho monster we know what belongs to a frippery
O king Stephano
Put off that gown Trinculo by this hand Ill have
that gown
Thy grace shall have it
The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage Lets alone
And do the murder first if he awake
From toe to crown hell fill our skins with pinches
Make us strange stuff
Be you quiet monster Mistress line
is not this my jerkin Now is the jerkin under
the line now jerkin you are like to lose your
hair and prove a bald jerkin
Do do we steal by line and level ant like your grace
I thank thee for that jest heres a garment fort
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
country Steal by line and level is an excellent
pass of pate theres another garment fort
Monster come put some lime upon your fingers and
away with the rest
I will have none ont we shall lose our time
And all be turnd to barnacles or to apes
With foreheads villanous low
Monster layto your fingers help to bear this
away where my hogshead of wine is or Ill turn you
out of my kingdom go to carry this
And this
Ay and this
A noise of hunters heard Enter divers Spirits  in shape of dogs and hounds and hunt them about PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on
Hey Mountain hey
Silver I there it goes Silver
Fury Fury there Tyrant there hark hark
CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO are driven out
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps and more pinchspotted make them
Than pard or cat o mountain
Hark they roar
Let them be hunted soundly At this hour
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies
Shortly shall all my labours end and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom for a little
Follow and do me service
Exeunt
Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes and ARIEL
Now does my project gather to a head
My charms crack not my spirits obey and time
Goes upright with his carriage Hows the day
On the sixth hour at which time my lord
You said our work should cease
I did say so
When first I raised the tempest Say my spirit
How fares the king ands followers
Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge
Just as you left them all prisoners sir
In the linegrove which weatherfends your cell
They cannot budge till your release The king
And the remainder mourning over them
Brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
Him that you termd sir The good old lord Gonzalo
His tears run down his beard like winters drops
From eaves of reeds Your charm so strongly works em
That if you now beheld them your affections
Would become tender
Dost thou think so spirit
Mine would sir were I human
And mine shall
Hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
Of their afflictions and shall not myself
One of their kind that relish all as sharply
Passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick
Yet with my nobler reason gaitist my fury
In virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further Go release them Ariel
My charms Ill break their senses Ill restore
And they shall be themselves
Ill fetch them sir
Exit
Ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
When he comes back you demipuppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
Weak masters though ye be I have bedimmd
The noontide sun calld forth the mutinous winds
And twixt the green sea and the azured vault
Set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder
Have I given fire and rifted Joves stout oak
With his own bolt the strongbased promontory
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluckd up
The pine and cedar graves at my command
Have waked their sleepers oped and let em forth
By my so potent art But this rough magic
I here abjure and when I have required
Some heavenly music which even now I do
To work mine end upon their senses that
This airy charm is for Ill break my staff
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
Ill drown my book
Solemn music
Reenter ARIEL before then ALONSO with a  frantic gesture attended by GONZALO  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made  and there stand charmed which PROSPERO observing speaks
A solemn air and the best comforter
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
Now useless boild within thy skull There stand
For you are spellstoppd
Holy Gonzalo honourable man
Mine eyes even sociable to the show of thine
Fall fellowly drops The charm dissolves apace
And as the morning steals upon the night
Melting the darkness so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason O good Gonzalo
My true preserver and a loyal sir
To him you followst I will pay thy graces
Home both in word and deed Most cruelly
Didst thou Alonso use me and my daughter
Thou art pinchd fort now Sebastian Flesh and blood
You brother mine that entertaind ambition
Expelld remorse and nature who with Sebastian
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong
Would here have killd your king I do forgive thee
Unnatural though thou art Their understanding
Begins to swell and the approaching tide
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy Not one of them
That yet looks on me or would know me Ariel
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell
I will discase me and myself present
As I was sometime Milan quickly spirit
Thou shalt ere long be free
ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
Where the bee sucks there suck I
In a cowslips bell I lie
There I couch when owls do cry
On the bats back I do fly
After summer merrily
Merrily merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough
Why thats my dainty Ariel I shall miss thee
But yet thou shalt have freedom so so so
To the kings ship invisible as thou art
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches the master and the boatswain
Being awake enforce them to this place
And presently I prithee
I drink the air before me and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat
Exit
All torment trouble wonder and amazement
Inhabits here some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country
Behold sir king
The wronged Duke of Milan Prospero
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee I embrace thy body
And to thee and thy company I bid
A hearty welcome
Whether thou best he or no
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
As late I have been I not know thy pulse
Beats as of flesh and blood and since I saw thee
The affliction of my mind amends with which
I fear a madness held me this must crave
An if this be at all a most strange story
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs But how should Prospero
Be living and be here
First noble friend
Let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
Be measured or confined
Whether this be
Or be not Ill not swear
You do yet taste
Some subtilties o the isle that will not let you
Believe things certain Welcome my friends all
Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
But you my brace of lords were I so minded
I here could pluck his highness frown upon you
And justify you traitors at this time
I will tell no tales
Aside  The devil speaks in him
No
For you most wicked sir whom to call brother
Would even infect my mouth I do forgive
Thy rankest fault all of them and require
My dukedom of thee which perforce I know
Thou must restore
If thou best Prospero
Give us particulars of thy preservation
How thou hast met us here who three hours since
Were wreckd upon this shore where I have lost
How sharp the point of this remembrance is
My dear son Ferdinand
I am woe fort sir
Irreparable is the loss and patience
Says it is past her cure
I rather think
You have not sought her help of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
And rest myself content
You the like loss
As great to me as late and supportable
To make the dear loss have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you for I
Have lost my daughter
A daughter
O heavens that they were living both in Naples
The king and queen there that they were I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies When did you lose your daughter
In this last tempest I perceive these lords
At this encounter do so much admire
That they devour their reason and scarce think
Their eyes do offices of truth their words
Are natural breath but howsoeer you have
Been justled from your senses know for certain
That I am Prospero and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely
Upon this shore where you were wreckd was landed
To be the lord ont No more yet of this
For tis a chronicle of day by day
Not a relation for a breakfast nor
Befitting this first meeting Welcome sir
This cells my court here have I few attendants
And subjects none abroad pray you look in
My dukedom since you have given me again
I will requite you with as good a thing
At least bring forth a wonder to content ye
As much as me my dukedom
Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess
Sweet lord you play me false
No my dearst love
I would not for the world
Yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
And I would call it fair play
If this prove
A vision of the Island one dear son
Shall I twice lose
A most high miracle
Though the seas threaten they are merciful
I have cursed them without cause
Kneels
Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about
Arise and say how thou camest here
O wonder
How many goodly creatures are there here
How beauteous mankind is O brave new world
That has such people int
Tis new to thee
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play
Your eldst acquaintance cannot be three hours
Is she the goddess that hath severd us
And brought us thus together
Sir she is mortal
But by immortal Providence shes mine
I chose her when I could not ask my father
For his advice nor thought I had one She
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan
Of whom so often I have heard renown
But never saw before of whom I have
Received a second life and second father
This lady makes him to me
I am hers
But O how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness
There sir stop
Let us not burthen our remembrance with
A heaviness thats gone
I have inly wept
Or should have spoke ere this Look down you god
And on this couple drop a blessed crown
For it is you that have chalkd forth the way
Which brought us hither
I say Amen Gonzalo
Was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue
Should become kings of Naples O rejoice
Beyond a common joy and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars In one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis
And Ferdinand her brother found a wife
Where he himself was lost Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own
To FERDINAND and MIRANDA  Give me your hands
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy
Be it so Amen
Reenter ARIEL with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following
O look sir look sir here is more of us
I prophesied if a gallows were on land
This fellow could not drown Now blasphemy
That swearst grace oerboard not an oath on shore
Hast thou no mouth by land What is the news
The best news is that we have safely found
Our king and company the next our ship
Which but three glasses since we gave out split
Is tight and yare and bravely riggd as when
We first put out to sea
Aside to PROSPERO  Sir all this service
Have I done since I went
Aside to ARIEL  My tricksy spirit
These are not natural events they strengthen
From strange to stranger Say how came you hither
If I did think sir I were well awake
Ild strive to tell you We were dead of sleep
Andhow we know notall clappd under hatches
Where but even now with strange and several noises
Of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
And more diversity of sounds all horrible
We were awaked straightway at liberty
Where we in all her trim freshly beheld
Our royal good and gallant ship our master
Capering to eye her on a trice so please you
Even in a dream were we divided from them
And were brought moping hither
Aside to PROSPERO          Wast well done
Aside to ARIEL  Bravely my diligence Thou shalt be free
This is as strange a maze as eer men trod
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge
Sir my liege
Do not infest your mind with beating on
The strangeness of this business at pickd leisure
Which shall be shortly single Ill resolve you
Which to you shall seem probable of every
These happend accidents till when be cheerful
And think of each thing well
Aside to ARIEL
Come hither spirit
Set Caliban and his companions free
Untie the spell
Exit ARIEL
How fares my gracious sir
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not
Reenter ARIEL driving in CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO in their stolen apparel
Every man shift for all the rest and
let no man take care for himself for all is
but fortune Coragio bullymonster coragio
If these be true spies which I wear in my head
heres a goodly sight
O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed
How fine my master is I am afraid
He will chastise me
Ha ha
What things are these my lord Antonio
Will money buy em
Very like one of them
Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
Mark but the badges of these men my lords
Then say if they be true This misshapen knave
His mother was a witch and one so strong
That could control the moon make flows and ebbs
And deal in her command without her power
These three have robbd me and this demidevil
For hes a bastard onehad plotted with them
To take my life Two of these fellows you
Must know and own this thing of darkness
Acknowledge mine
I shall be pinchd to death
Is not this Stephano my drunken butler
He is drunk now where had he wine
And Trinculo is reeling ripe where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded em
How camest thou in this pickle
I have been in such a pickle since I
saw you last that I fear me will never out of
my bones I shall not fear flyblowing
Why how now Stephano
O touch me not I am not Stephano but a cramp
Yould be king o the isle sirrah
I should have been a sore one then
This is a strange thing as eer I lookd on
Pointing to Caliban
He is as disproportiond in his manners
As in his shape Go sirrah to my cell
Take with you your companions as you look
To have my pardon trim it handsomely
Ay that I will and Ill be wise hereafter
And seek for grace What a thricedouble ass
Was I to take this drunkard for a god
And worship this dull fool
Go to away
Hence and bestow your luggage where you found it
Or stole it rather
Exeunt CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO
Sir I invite your highness and your train
To my poor cell where you shall take your rest
For this one night which part of it Ill waste
With such discourse as I not doubt shall make it
Go quick away the story of my life
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle and in the morn
Ill bring you to your ship and so to Naples
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dearbeloved solemnized
And thence retire me to my Milan where
Every third thought shall be my grave
I long
To hear the story of your life which must
Take the ear strangely
Ill deliver all
And promise you calm seas auspicious gales
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off
Aside to ARIEL
My Ariel chick
That is thy charge then to the elements
Be free and fare thou well Please you draw near
Exeunt
EPILOGUE
SPOKEN BY PROSPERO
Now my charms are all oerthrown
And what strength I haves mine own
Which is most faint now tis true
I must be here confined by you
Or sent to Naples Let me not
Since I have my dukedom got
And pardond the deceiver dwell
In this bare island by your spell
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill or else my project fails
Which was to please Now I want
Spirits to enforce art to enchant
And my ending is despair
Unless I be relieved by prayer
Which pierces so that it assaults
Mercy itself and frees all faults
As you from crimes would pardond be
Let your indulgence set me free
Enter Poet Painter Jeweller Merchant and others at several doors
Good day sir
I am glad youre well
I have not seen you long how goes the world
It wears sir as it grows
Ay thats well known
But what particular rarity what strange
Which manifold record not matches See
Magic of bounty all these spirits thy power
Hath conjured to attend I know the merchant
I know them both th others a jeweller
O tis a worthy lord
Nay thats most fixd
A most incomparable man breathed as it were
To an untirable and continuate goodness
He passes
JewellerI have a jewel here
O pray lets seet for the Lord Timon sir
JewellerIf he will touch the estimate but for that
Reciting to himself  When we for recompense have
praised the vile
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Which aptly sings the good
Tis a good form
Looking at the jewel
And rich here is a water look ye
You are rapt sir in some work some dedication
To the great lord
A thing slippd idly from me
Our poesy is as a gum which oozes
From whence tis nourishd the fire i the flint
Shows not till it be struck our gentle flame
Provokes itself and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes What have you there
A picture sir When comes your book forth
Upon the heels of my presentment sir
Lets see your piece
Tis a good piece
So tis this comes off well and excellent
Indifferent
Admirable how this grace
Speaks his own standing what a mental power
This eye shoots forth how big imagination
Moves in this lip to the dumbness of the gesture
One might interpret
It is a pretty mocking of the life
Here is a touch ist good
I will say of it
It tutors nature artificial strife
Lives in these touches livelier than life
Enter certain Senators and pass over
How this lord is followd
The senators of Athens happy man
Look more
You see this confluence this great flood
of visitors
I have in this rough work shaped out a man
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
With amplest entertainment my free drift
Halts not particularly but moves itself
In a wide sea of wax no levelld malice
Infects one comma in the course I hold
But flies an eagle flight bold and forth on
How shall I understand you
I will unbolt to you
You see how all conditions how all minds
As well of glib and slippery creatures as
Of grave and austere quality tender down
Their services to Lord Timon his large fortune
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
All sorts of hearts yea from the glassfaced flatterer
To Apemantus that few things loves better
Than to abhor himself even he drops down
The knee before him and returns in peace
Most rich in Timons nod
I saw them speak together
Sir I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Feignd Fortune to be throned the base o the mount
Is rankd with all deserts all kind of natures
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
To propagate their states amongst them all
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixd
One do I personate of Lord Timons frame
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals
Tis conceived to scope
This throne this Fortune and this hill methinks
With one man beckond from the rest below
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
To climb his happiness would be well expressd
In our condition
Nay sir but hear me on
All those which were his fellows but of late
Some better than his value on the moment
Follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear
Make sacred even his stirrup and through him
Drink the free air
Ay marry what of these
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved all his dependants
Which labourd after him to the mountains top
Even on their knees and hands let him slip down
Not one accompanying his declining foot
Tis common
A thousand moral paintings I can show
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortunes
More pregnantly than words Yet you do well
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
The foot above the head
Trumpets sound Enter TIMON addressing himself  courteously to every suitor a Messenger from  VENTIDIUS talking with him LUCILIUS and other servants following
Imprisond is he say you
Ay my good lord five talents is his debt
His means most short his creditors most strait
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up which failing
Periods his comfort
Noble Ventidius Well
I am not of that feather to shake off
My friend when he must need me I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help
Which he shall have Ill pay the debt
and free him
Your lordship ever binds him
Commend me to him I will send his ransom
And being enfranchised bid him come to me
Tis not enough to help the feeble up
But to support him after Fare you well
All happiness to your honour
Exit
Enter an old Athenian
Lord Timon hear me speak
Freely good father
Thou hast a servant named Lucilius
I have so what of him
Most noble Timon call the man before thee
Attends he here or no Lucilius
Here at your lordships service
This fellow here Lord Timon this thy creature
By night frequents my house I am a man
That from my first have been inclined to thrift
And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Than one which holds a trencher
Well what further
One only daughter have I no kin else
On whom I may confer what I have got
The maid is fair o the youngest for a bride
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best This man of thine
Attempts her love I prithee noble lord
Join with me to forbid him her resort
Myself have spoke in vain
The man is honest
Therefore he will be Timon
His honesty rewards him in itself
It must not bear my daughter
Does she love him
She is young and apt
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
What levitys in youth
To LUCILIUS           Love you the maid
Ay my good lord and she accepts of it
If in her marriage my consent be missing
I call the gods to witness I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world
And dispossess her all
How shall she be endowd
if she be mated with an equal husband
Three talents on the present in future all
This gentleman of mine hath served me long
To build his fortune I will strain a little
For tis a bond in men Give him thy daughter
What you bestow in him Ill counterpoise
And make him weigh with her
Most noble lord
Pawn me to this your honour she is his
My hand to thee mine honour on my promise
Humbly I thank your lordship never may
The state or fortune fall into my keeping
Which is not owed to you
Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian
Vouchsafe my labour and long live your lordship
I thank you you shall hear from me anon
Go not away What have you there my friend
A piece of painting which I do beseech
Your lordship to accept
Painting is welcome
The painting is almost the natural man
or since dishonour traffics with mans nature
He is but outside these pencilld figures are
Even such as they give out I like your work
And you shall find I like it wait attendance
Till you hear further from me
The gods preserve ye
Well fare you gentleman give me your hand
We must needs dine together Sir your jewel
Hath sufferd under praise
What my lord dispraise
A more satiety of commendations
If I should pay you fort as tis extolld
It would unclew me quite
My lord tis rated
As those which sell would give but you well know
Things of like value differing in the owners
Are prized by their masters believet dear lord
You mend the jewel by the wearing it
Well mockd
No my good lord he speaks the common tongue
Which all men speak with him
Look who comes here will you be chid
Enter APEMANTUS
Jeweller Well bear with your lordship
Hell spare none
Good morrow to thee gentle Apemantus
Till I be gentle stay thou for thy good morrow
When thou art Timons dog and these knaves honest
Why dost thou call them knaves thou knowst them not
Are they not Athenians
Yes
Then I repent not
Jeweller You know me Apemantus
Thou knowst I do I calld thee by thy name
Thou art proud Apemantus
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon
Whither art going
To knock out an honest Athenians brains
Thats a deed thoult die for
Right if doing nothing be death by the law
How likest thou this picture Apemantus
The best for the innocence
Wrought he not well that painted it
He wrought better that made the painter and yet
hes but a filthy piece of work
Youre a dog
Thy mothers of my generation whats she if I be a dog
Wilt dine with me Apemantus
No I eat not lords
An thou shouldst thou ldst anger ladies
O they eat lords so they come by great bellies
Thats a lascivious apprehension
So thou apprehendest it take it for thy labour
How dost thou like this jewel Apemantus
Not so well as plaindealing which will not cost a
man a doit
What dost thou think tis worth
Not worth my thinking How now poet
How now philosopher
Thou liest
Art not one
Yes
Then I lie not
Art not a poet
Yes
Then thou liest look in thy last work where thou
hast feigned him a worthy fellow
Thats not feigned he is so
Yes he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy
labour he that loves to be flattered is worthy o
the flatterer Heavens that I were a lord
What wouldst do then Apemantus
Een as Apemantus does now hate a lord with my heart
What thyself
Ay
Wherefore
That I had no angry wit to be a lord
Art not thou a merchant
Ay Apemantus
Traffic confound thee if the gods will not
If traffic do it the gods do it
Traffics thy god and thy god confound thee
Trumpet sounds Enter a Messenger
What trumpets that
Tis Alcibiades and some twenty horse
All of companionship
Pray entertain them give them guide to us
Exeunt some Attendants
You must needs dine with me go not you hence
Till I have thankd you when dinners done
Show me this piece I am joyful of your sights
Enter ALCIBIADES with the rest
Most welcome sir
So so there
That there should be small love mongst these
sweet knaves
And all this courtesy The strain of mans bred out
Into baboon and monkey
Sir you have saved my longing and I feed
Most hungerly on your sight
Right welcome sir
Ere we depart well share a bounteous time
In different pleasures Pray you let us in
Exeunt all except APEMANTUS
Enter two Lords
What time o day ist Apemantus
Time to be honest
That time serves still
The more accursed thou that still omittst it
Thou art going to Lord Timons feast
Ay to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools
Fare thee well fare thee well
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice
Why Apemantus
Shouldst have kept one to thyself for I mean to
give thee none
Hang thyself
No I will do nothing at thy bidding make thy
requests to thy friend
Away unpeaceable dog or Ill spurn thee hence
I will fly like a dog the heels o the ass
Exit
Hes opposite to humanity Come shall we in
And taste Lord Timons bounty he outgoes
The very heart of kindness
He pours it out Plutus the god of gold
Is but his steward no meed but he repays
Sevenfold above itself no gift to him
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance
The noblest mind he carries
That ever governd man
Long may he live in fortunes Shall we in
Ill keep you company
Exeunt
Hautboys playing loud music A great banquet  served in FLAVIUS and others attending then enter  TIMON ALCIBIADES Lords Senators and VENTIDIUS  Then comes dropping after all APEMANTUS discontentedly like himself
Most honourd Timon
It hath pleased the gods to remember my fathers age
And call him to long peace
He is gone happy and has left me rich
Then as in grateful virtue I am bound
To your free heart I do return those talents
Doubled with thanks and service from whose help
I derived liberty
O by no means
Honest Ventidius you mistake my love
I gave it freely ever and theres none
Can truly say he gives if he receives
If our betters play at that game we must not dare
To imitate them faults that are rich are fair
A noble spirit
Nay my lords
They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON
Ceremony was but devised at first
To set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes
Recanting goodness sorry ere tis shown
But where there is true friendship there needs none
Pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes
Than my fortunes to me
They sit
My lord we always have confessd it
Ho ho confessd it hangd it have you not
O Apemantus you are welcome
No
You shall not make me welcome
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors
Fie thourt a churl yeve got a humour there
Does not become a man tis much to blame
They say my lords ira furor brevis est but yond
man is ever angry Go let him have a table by
himself for he does neither affect company nor is
he fit fort indeed
Let me stay at thine apperil Timon I come to
observe I give thee warning ont
I take no heed of thee thourt an Athenian
therefore welcome I myself would have no power
prithee let my meat make thee silent
I scorn thy meat twould choke me for I should
neer flatter thee O you gods what a number of
men eat Timon and he sees em not It grieves me
to see so many dip their meat in one mans blood
and all the madness is he cheers them up too
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men
Methinks they should invite them without knives
Good for their meat and safer for their lives
Theres much example fort the fellow that sits
next him now parts bread with him pledges the
breath of him in a divided draught is the readiest
man to kill him t has been proved If I were a
huge man I should fear to drink at meals
Lest they should spy my windpipes dangerous notes
Great men should drink with harness on their throats
My lord in heart and let the health go round
Let it flow this way my good lord
Flow this way A brave fellow he keeps his tides
well Those healths will make thee and thy state
look ill Timon Heres that which is too weak to
be a sinner honest water which neer left man i the mire
This and my food are equals theres no odds
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods
Apemantus grace
Immortal gods I crave no pelf
I pray for no man but myself
Grant I may never prove so fond
To trust man on his oath or bond
Or a harlot for her weeping
Or a dog that seems asleeping
Or a keeper with my freedom
Or my friends if I should need em
Amen So fall tot
Rich men sin and I eat root
Eats and drinks
Much good dich thy good heart Apemantus
Captain Alcibiades your hearts in the field now
My heart is ever at your service my lord
You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
dinner of friends
So the were bleedingnew my lord theres no meat
like em I could wish my best friend at such a feast
Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then
that then thou mightst kill em and bid me to em
Might we but have that happiness my lord that you
would once use our hearts whereby we might express
some part of our zeals we should think ourselves
for ever perfect
O no doubt my good friends but the gods
themselves have provided that I shall have much help
from you how had you been my friends else why
have you that charitable title from thousands did
not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
speak in your own behalf and thus far I confirm
you O you gods think I what need we have any
friends if we should neer have need of em they
were the most needless creatures living should we
neer have use for em and would most resemble
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
sounds to themselves Why I have often wished
myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We
are born to do benefits and what better or
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
friends O what a precious comfort tis to have
so many like brothers commanding one anothers
fortunes O joy een made away ere t can be born
Mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks to
forget their faults I drink to you
Thou weepest to make them drink Timon
Joy had the like conception in our eyes
And at that instant like a babe sprung up
Ho ho I laugh to think that babe a bastard
I promise you my lord you moved me much
Much
Tucket within
What means that trump
Enter a Servant
How now
Please you my lord there are certain
ladies most desirous of admittance
Ladies what are their wills
There comes with them a forerunner my lord which
bears that office to signify their pleasures
I pray let them be admitted
Enter Cupid
Hail to thee worthy Timon and to all
That of his bounties taste The five best senses
Acknowledge thee their patron and come freely
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom th ear
Taste touch and smell pleased from thy tale rise
They only now come but to feast thine eyes
Theyre welcome all let em have kind admittance
Music make their welcome
Exit Cupid
You see my lord how ample youre beloved
Music Reenter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons with lutes in their hands dancing and playing
Hoyday what a sweep of vanity comes this way
They dance they are mad women
Like madness is the glory of this life
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves
And spend our flatteries to drink those men
Upon whose age we void it up again
With poisonous spite and envy
Who lives thats not depraved or depraves
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
Of their friends gift
I should fear those that dance before me now
Would one day stamp upon me t has been done
Men shut their doors against a setting sun
The Lords rise from table with much adoring of  TIMON and to show their loves each singles out an  Amazon and all dance men with women a lofty strain or two to the hautboys and cease
You have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment
Which was not half so beautiful and kind
You have added worth unto t and lustre
And entertaind me with mine own device
I am to thank you for t
My lord you take us even at the best
Faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold
taking I doubt me
Ladies there is an idle banquet attends you
Please you to dispose yourselves
Most thankfully my lord
Exeunt Cupid and Ladies
Flavius
My lord
The little casket bring me hither
Yes my lord More jewels yet
There is no crossing him in s humour
Aside
Else I should tell himwell i faith I should
When alls spent he ld be crossd then an he could
Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind
That man might neer be wretched for his mind
Exit
Where be our men
Here my lord in readiness
Our horses
Reenter FLAVIUS with the casket
O my friends
I have one word to say to you look you my good lord
I must entreat you honour me so much
As to advance this jewel accept it and wear it
Kind my lord
I am so far already in your gifts
So are we all
Enter a Servant
My lord there are certain nobles of the senate
Newly alighted and come to visit you
They are fairly welcome
I beseech your honour
Vouchsafe me a word it does concern you near
Near why then another time Ill hear thee
I prithee lets be provided to show them
entertainment
Aside  I scarce know how
Enter a Second Servant
May it please your honour Lord Lucius
Out of his free love hath presented to you
Four milkwhite horses trappd in silver
I shall accept them fairly let the presents
Be worthily entertaind
Enter a third Servant
How now what news
Please you my lord that honourable
gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company
tomorrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour
two brace of greyhounds
Ill hunt with him and let them be received
Not without fair reward
Aside                What will this come to
He commands us to provide and give great gifts
And all out of an empty coffer
Nor will he know his purse or yield me this
To show him what a beggar his heart is
Being of no power to make his wishes good
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt he owes
For every word he is so kind that he now
Pays interest for t his lands put to their books
Well would I were gently put out of office
Before I were forced out
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
Than such that do een enemies exceed
I bleed inwardly for my lord
Exit
You do yourselves
Much wrong you bate too much of your own merits
Here my lord a trifle of our love
With more than common thanks I will receive it
O hes the very soul of bounty
And now I remember my lord you gave
Good words the other day of a bay courser
I rode on it is yours because you liked it
O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that
You may take my word my lord I know no man
Can justly praise but what he does affect
I weigh my friends affection with mine own
Ill tell you true Ill call to you
O none so welcome
I take all and your several visitations
So kind to heart tis not enough to give
Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends
And neer be weary Alcibiades
Thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich
It comes in charity to thee for all thy living
Is mongst the dead and all the lands thou hast
Lie in a pitchd field
Ay defiled land my lord
We are so virtuously bound
And so
Am I to you
So infinitely endeard
All to you Lights more lights
The best of happiness
Honour and fortunes keep with you Lord Timon
Ready for his friends
Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON
What a coils here
Serving of becks and juttingout of bums
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
That are given for em Friendships full of dregs
Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on courtsies
Now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen I would be
good to thee
No Ill nothing for if I should be bribed too
there would be none left to rail upon thee and then
thou wouldst sin the faster Thou givest so long
Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
paper shortly what need these feasts pomps and
vainglories
Nay an you begin to rail on society once I am
sworn not to give regard to you Farewell and come
with better music
Exit
So
Thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then
Ill lock thy heaven from thee
O that mens ears should be
To counsel deaf but not to flattery
Exit
Enter Senator with papers in his hand
And late five thousand to Varro and to Isidore
He owes nine thousand besides my former sum
Which makes it five and twenty Still in motion
Of raging waste It cannot hold it will not
If I want gold steal but a beggars dog
And give it Timon why the dog coins gold
If I would sell my horse and buy twenty more
Better than he why give my horse to Timon
Ask nothing give it him it foals me straight
And able horses No porter at his gate
But rather one that smiles and still invites
All that pass by It cannot hold no reason
Can found his state in safety Caphis ho
Caphis I say

With slight denial nor then silenced when
Commend me to your masterand the cap
Plays in the right hand thus but tell him
My uses cry to me I must serve my turn
Out of mine own his days and times are past
Have smit my credit I love and honour him
But must not break my back to heal his finger
Immediate are my needs and my relief
Must not be tossd and turnd to me in words
But find supply immediate Get you gone
Put on a most importunate aspect
A visage of demand for I do fear
When every feather sticks in his own wing
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull
Which flashes now a phoenix Get you gone

And have the dates in contempt
I will sir
Go
Exeunt
Enter FLAVIUS with many bills in his hand
No care no stop so senseless of expense
That he will neither know how to maintain it
Nor cease his flow of riot takes no account

What shall be done he will not hear till feel
I must be round with him now he comes from hunting
Fie fie fie fie

shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore

Varros ServantThou art not altogether a fool

That answer might have become Apemantus
Aside aside here comes Lord Timon
Reenter TIMON and FLAVIUS
Come with me fool come
I do not always follow lover elder brother and
woman sometime the philosopher
Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool
Pray you walk near Ill speak with you anon
Exeunt Servants
You make me marvel wherefore ere this time
Had you not fully laid my state before me
That I might so have rated my expense
As I had leave of means
You would not hear me
At many leisures I proposed
Go to
Perchance some single vantages you took
When my indispos ition put you back
And that unaptness made your minister
Thus to excuse yourself
O my good lord
At many times I brought in my accounts
Laid them before you you would throw them off
And say you found them in mine honesty
When for some trifling present you have bid me
Return so much I have shook my head and wept
Yea gainst the authority of manners prayd you
To hold your hand more close I did endure
Not seldom nor no slight cheques when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts My loved lord
Though you hear now too lateyet nows a time
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts
Let all my land be sold
Tis all engaged some forfeited and gone
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues the future comes apace
What shall defend the interim and at length
How goes our reckoning
To Lacedaemon did my land extend
O my good lord the world is but a word
Were it all yours to give it in a breath
How quickly were it gone
You tell me true
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood
And set me on the proof So the gods bless me
When all our offices have been oppressd
With riotous feeders when our vaults have wept
With drunken spilth of wine when every room
Hath blazed with lights and brayd with minstrelsy
I have retired me to a wasteful cock
And set mine eyes at flow
Prithee no more
Heavens have I said the bounty of this lord
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
This night englutted Who is not Timons
What heart head sword force means but is
Lord Timons
Great Timon noble worthy royal Timon
Ah when the means are gone that buy this praise
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made
Feastwon fastlost one cloud of winter showers
These flies are couchd
Come sermon me no further
No villanous bounty yet hath passd my heart
Unwisely not ignobly have I given
Why dost thou weep Canst thou the conscience lack
To think I shall lack friends Secure thy heart
If I would broach the vessels of my love
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing
Men and mens fortunes could I frankly use
As I can bid thee speak
Assurance bless your thoughts
And in some sort these wants of mine are crownd
That I account them blessings for by these
Shall I try friends you shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes I am wealthy in my friends
Within there Flaminius Servilius
Enter FLAMINIUS SERVILIUS and other Servants
My lord my lord
I will dispatch you severally you to Lord Lucius
to Lord Lucullus you I hunted with his honour

loves and I am proud say that my occasions have
found time to use em toward a supply of money let
the request be fifty talents
As you have said my lord
Aside  Lord Lucius and Lucullus hum
Go you sir to the senators
Of whom even to the states best health I have
Deserved this hearingbid em send o the instant
A thousand talents to me
I have been bold
For that I knew it the most general way
To them to use your signet and your name
But they do shake their heads and I am here
No richer in return
Ist true cant be
They answer in a joint and corporate voice
That now they are at fall want treasure cannot
Do what they would are sorryyou are honourable
But yet they could have wishdthey know not
Something hath been amissa noble nature
May catch a wrenchwould all were welltis pity
And so intending other serious matters
With certain halfcaps and coldmoving nods
They froze me into silence
You gods reward them
Prithee man look cheerly These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary
Their blood is caked tis cold it seldom flows
Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind
And nature as it grows again toward earth
Is fashiond for the journey dull and heavy
To a Servant
Go to Ventidius
To FLAVIUS
Prithee be not sad
Thou art true and honest ingeniously I speak
No blame belongs to thee
To Servant
Ventidius lately
Buried his father by whose death hes steppd
Into a great estate when he was poor
Imprisond and in scarcity of friends
I cleard him with five talents greet him from me
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend which craves to be rememberd
With those five talents
Exit Servant
To FLAVIUS
That had givet these fellows
To whom tis instant due Neer speak or think
That Timons fortunes mong his friends can sink
I would I could not think it that thought is
bountys foe
Being free itself it thinks all others so
Exeunt

And how does that honourable complete freehearted
gentleman of Athens thy very bountiful good lord
and master
His health is well sir
I am right glad that his health is well sir and
what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty Flaminius
Faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my
lords behalf I come to entreat your honour to
supply who having great and instant occasion to
use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to
furnish him nothing doubting your present
assistance therein
La la la la nothing doubting says he Alas
good lord a noble gentleman tis if he would not
keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha
dined with him and told him ont and come again to
supper to him of purpose to have him spend less
and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning
by my coming Every man has his fault and honesty
is his I ha told him ont but I could neer get
him fromt
Reenter Servant with wine
Please your lordship here is the wine
Flaminius I have noted thee always wise Heres to thee
Your lordship speaks your pleasure
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
spiritgive thee thy dueand one that knows what
belongs to reason and canst use the time well if
the time use thee well good parts in thee
To Servant
Get you gone sirrah
Exit Servant
Draw nearer honest Flaminius Thy lords a
bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou
knowest well enough although thou comest to me
that this is no time to lend money especially upon
bare friendship without security Heres three
solidares for thee good boy wink at me and say
thou sawest me not Fare thee well
Ist possible the world should so much differ
And we alive that lived Fly damned baseness
To him that worships thee
Throwing the money back
Ha now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master
Exit
May these add to the number that may scald thee
Let moulten coin be thy damnation
Thou disease of a friend and not himself
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart
It turns in less than two nights O you gods
I feel masters passion this slave
Unto his honour has my lords meat in him
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
When he is turnd to poison
O may diseases only work upont
And when hes sick to death let not that part of nature
Which my lord paid for be of any power
To expel sickness but prolong his hour
Exit
Enter LUCILIUS with three Strangers
Who the Lord Timon he is my very good friend and
an honourable gentleman
We know him for no less though we are but strangers
to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and
which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timons
happy hours are done and past and his estate
shrinks from him
Fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money
But believe you this my lord that not long ago
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
so many talents nay urged extremely fort and
showed what necessity belonged tot and yet was denied
How
I tell you denied my lord
What a strange case was that now before the gods
I am ashamed ont Denied that honourable man
there was very little honour showed int For my own
part I must needs confess I have received some
small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels
and suchlike trifles nothing comparing to his
yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should
neer have denied his occasion so many talents
Enter SERVILIUS
See by good hap yonders my lord
I have sweat to see his honour My honoured lord
To LUCIUS
Servilius you are kindly met sir Fare thee well
commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very
exquisite friend
May it please your honour my lord hath sent
Ha what has he sent I am so much endeared to
that lord hes ever sending how shall I thank
him thinkest thou And what has he sent now
Has only sent his present occasion now my lord
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
with so many talents
I know his lordship is but merry with me
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents
But in the mean time he wants less my lord
If his occasion were not virtuous
I should not urge it half so faithfully
Dost thou speak seriously Servilius
Upon my soultis true sir
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
against such a good time when I might ha shown
myself honourable how unluckily it happened that I
should purchase the day before for a little part
and undo a great deal of honoured Servilius now
before the gods I am not able to dothe more
beast I sayI was sending to use Lord Timon
myself these gentlemen can witness but I would
not for the wealth of Athens I had donet now
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me
because I have no power to be kind and tell him
this from me I count it one of my greatest
afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you
befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him
Yes sir I shall
Ill look you out a good turn Servilius
Exit SERVILIUS
True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed
And he thats once denied will hardly speed
Exit
Do you observe this Hostilius
Ay too well
Why this is the worlds soul and just of the
same piece
Is every flatterers spirit Who can call him
His friend that dips in the same dish for in
My knowing Timon has been this lords father
And kept his credit with his purse
Supported his estate nay Timons money
Has paid his men their wages he neer drinks
But Timons silver treads upon his lip
And yetO see the monstrousness of man
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape
He does deny him in respect of his
What charitable men afford to beggars
Religion groans at it
For mine own part
I never tasted Timon in my life
Nor came any of his bounties over me
To mark me for his friend yet I protest
For his right noble mind illustrious virtue
And honourable carriage
Had his necessity made use of me
I would have put my wealth into donation
And the best half should have returnd to him
So much I love his heart but I perceive
Men must learn now with pity to dispense
For policy sits above conscience
Exeunt
Enter SEMPRONIUS and a Servant of TIMONs
Must he needs trouble me in thumbove
all others
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus
And now Ventidius is wealthy too
Whom he redeemd from prison all these
Owe their estates unto him
My lord
They have all been touchd and found base metal for
They have au denied him
How have they denied him
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him
And does he send to me Three hum
It shows but little love or judgment in him
Must I be his last refuge His friends like
physicians
Thrive give him over must I take the cure upon me
Has much disgraced me int Im angry at him
That might have known my place I see no sense fort
But his occasion might have wood me first
For in my conscience I was the first man
That eer received gift from him
And does he think so backwardly of me now
That Ill requite its last No
So it may prove an argument of laughter
To the rest and mongst lords I be thought a fool
Ild rather than the worth of thrice the sum
Had sent to me first but for my minds sake
Id such a courage to do him good But now return
And with their faint reply this answer join
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin
Exit
Excellent Your lordships a goodly villain The
devil knew not what he did when he made man
politic he crossed himself by t and I cannot
think but in the end the villainies of man will
set him clear How fairly this lord strives to
appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked
like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his
politic love
This was my lords best hope now all are fled
Save only the gods now his friends are dead
Doors that were neer acquainted with their wards
Many a bounteous year must be employd
Now to guard sure their master
And this is all a liberal course allows
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house
Exit
Enter two Servants of Varro and the Servant of  LUCIUS meeting TITUS HORTENSIUS and other Servants of TIMONs creditors waiting his coming out
Varros
Well met good morrow Titus and Hortensius
The like to you kind Varro
Lucius
What do we meet together
Lucilius ServantAy and I think
One business does command us all for mine Is money
So is theirs and ours
Enter PHILOTUS
Lucilius ServantAnd Sir Philotus too
Good day at once
Lucilius Servant                  Welcome good brother
What do you think the hour
Labouring for nine
Lucilius ServantSo much
Is not my lord seen yet
Lucilius ServantNot yet
I wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven
Lucilius ServantAy but the days are waxd shorter with him
You must consider that a prodigal course
Is like the suns but not like his recoverable
I fear tis deepest winter in Lord Timons purse
That is one may reach deep enough and yet
Find little
I am of your fear for that
Ill show you how to observe a strange event
Your lord sends now for money
Most true he does
And he wears jewels now of Timons gift
For which I wait for money
It is against my heart
Lucilius ServantMark how strange it shows
Timon in this should pay more than he owes
And een as if your lord should wear rich jewels
And send for money for em
Im weary of this charge the gods can witness
I know my lord hath spent of Timons wealth
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth
Varros
Yes mines three thousand crowns whats yours
Lucilius ServantFive thousand mine
Varros
Tis much deep and it should seem by the sun
Your masters confidence was above mine
Else surely his had equalld
Enter FLAMINIUS
One of Lord Timons men
Lucilius ServantFlaminius Sir a word pray is my lord ready to
come forth
No indeed he is not
We attend his lordship pray signify so much
I need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent
Exit
Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak muffled
Lucilius ServantHa is not that his steward muffled so
He goes away in a cloud call him call him
Do you hear sir
Varros
By your leave sir
What do ye ask of me my friend
We wait for certain money here sir
Ay
If money were as certain as your waiting
Twere sure enough
Why then preferrd you not your sums and bills
When your false masters eat of my lords meat
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
And take down the interest into their
gluttonous maws
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
Let me pass quietly
Believe t my lord and I have made an end
I have no more to reckon he to spend
Lucilius ServantAy but this answer will not serve
If twill not servetis not so base as you
For you serve knaves
Exit
Varros
How what does his cashiered worship mutter
Varros
No matter what hes poor and thats revenge
enough Who can speak broader than he that has no
house to put his head in such may rail against
great buildings
Enter SERVILIUS
O heres Servilius now we shall know some answer
If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some
other hour I should derive much fromt for
taket of my soul my lord leans wondrously to
discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him
hes much out of health and keeps his chamber
Lucilius Servant Many do keep their chambers are not sick
And if it be so far beyond his health
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts
And make a clear way to the gods
Good gods
We cannot take this for answer sir
Within  Servilius help My lord my lord
Enter TIMON in a rage FLAMINIUS following
What are my doors opposed against my passage
Have I been ever free and must my house
Be my retentive enemy my gaol
The place which I have feasted does it now
Like all mankind show me an iron heart
Lucilius ServantPut in now Titus
My lord here is my bill
Lucilius ServantHeres mine
And mine my lord

Exeunt
Reenter TIMON and FLAVIUS
They have een put my breath from me the slaves
Creditors devils
My dear lord
What if it should be so
My lord
Ill have it so My steward
Here my lord
So fitly Go bid all my friends again
Lucius Lucullus and Sempronius
All sirrah all
Ill once more feast the rascals
O my lord
There is not so much left to furnish out
A moderate table
Bet not in thy care go
I charge thee invite them all let in the tide
Of knaves once more my cook and Ill provide
Exeunt
My lord you have my voice to it the faults
Bloody tis necessary he should die
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy
Most true the law shall bruise him
Enter ALCIBIADES with Attendants
Honour health and compassion to the senate
Now captain
I am an humble suitor to your virtues
For pity is the virtue of the law
And none but tyrants use it cruelly
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood
Hath steppd into the law which is past depth
To those that without heed do plunge into t
He is a man setting his fate aside
Of comely virtues
An honour in him which buys out his fault
But with a noble fury and fair spirit
Seeing his reputation touchd to death
He did oppose his foe
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behave his anger ere twas spent
As if he had but proved an argument
You undergo too strict a paradox
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair
Your words have took such pains as if they labourd
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
Upon the head of valour which indeed
Is valour misbegot and came into the world
Hes truly valiant that can wisely suffer
The worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs
His outsides to wear them like his raiment
carelessly
And neer prefer his injuries to his heart
To bring it into danger
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
What folly tis to hazard life for ill
My lord
You cannot make gross sins look clear
To revenge is no valour but to bear
My lords then under favour pardon me
If I speak like a captain
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle
And not endure all threats sleep upont
And let the foes quietly cut their throats
Without repugnancy If there be
Such valour in the bearing what make we
Abroad why then women are more valiant
That stay at home if bearing carry it
And the ass more captain than the lion the felon
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge
If wisdom be in suffering O my lords
As you are great be pitifully good
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
To kill I grant is sins extremest gust
But in defence by mercy tis most just
To be in anger is impiety
But who is man that is not angry
Weigh but the crime with this
You breathe in vain
In vain his service done
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
Were a sufficient briber for his life
Whats that
I say my lords he has done fair service
And slain in fight many of your enemies
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
He has made too much plenty with em
Hes a sworn rioter he has a sin that often
Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner
If there were no foes that were enough
To overcome him in that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages
His days are foul and his drink dangerous
He dies
Hard fate he might have died in war
My lords if not for any parts in him
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
And be in debt to noneyet more to move you
Take my deserts to his and join em both
And for I know your reverend ages love
Security Ill pawn my victories all
My honours to you upon his good returns
If by this crime he owes the law his life
Why let the war receive t in valiant gore
For law is strict and war is nothing more
We are for law he dies urge it no more
On height of our displeasure friend or brother
He forfeits his own blood that spills another
Must it be so it must not be My lords
I do beseech you know me
How
Call me to your remembrances
What
I cannot think but your age has forgot me
It could not else be I should prove so base
To sue and be denied such common grace
My wounds ache at you
Do you dare our anger
Tis in few words but spacious in effect
We banish thee for ever
Banish me
Banish your dotage banish usury
That makes the senate ugly
If after two days shine Athens contain thee
Attend our weightier judgment And not to swell
our spirit
He shall be executed presently
Exeunt Senators
Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
Only in bone that none may look on you
Im worse than mad I have kept back their foes
While they have told their money and let out
Their coin upon large interest I myself
Rich only in large hurts All those for this
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
Pours into captains wounds Banishment
It comes not ill I hate not to be banishd
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
That I may strike at Athens Ill cheer up
My discontented troops and lay for hearts
Tis honour with most lands to be at odds
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods
Exit
Music Tables set out Servants attending  Enter divers Lords Senators and others at several doors
The good time of day to you sir
I also wish it to you I think this honourable lord
did but try us this other day
Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we
encountered I hope it is not so low with him as
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends
It should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting
I should think so he hath sent me an earnest
inviting which many my near occasions did urge me
to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and
I must needs appear
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
business but he would not hear my excuse I am
sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my
provision was out
I am sick of that grief too as I understand how all
things go
Every man heres so What would he have borrowed of
you
A thousand pieces
A thousand pieces
What of you
He sent to me sirHere he comes
Enter TIMON and Attendants
With all my heart gentlemen both and how fare you
Ever at the best hearing well of your lordship
The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
your lordship
Aside  Nor more willingly leaves winter such
summerbirds are men Gentlemen our dinner will not
recompense this long stay feast your ears with the
music awhile if they will fare so harshly o the
trumpets sound we shall to t presently
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
that I returned you an empty messenger
O sir let it not trouble you
My noble lord
Ah my good friend what cheer
My most honourable lord I am een sick of shame
that when your lordship this other day sent to me
I was so unfortunate a beggar
Think not on t sir
If you had sent but two hours before
Let it not cumber your better remembrance
The banquet brought in
Come bring in all together
All covered dishes
Royal cheer I warrant you
Doubt not that if money and the season can yield
it
How do you Whats the news
Alcibiades is banished hear you of it
Alcibiades banished
Tis so be sure of it
How how
I pray you upon what
My worthy friends will you draw near
Ill tell you more anon Heres a noble feast toward
This is the old man still
Will t hold will t hold
It does but time willand so
I do conceive
Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to
the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all
places alike Make not a city feast of it to let
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place
sit sit The gods require our thanks
thankfulness For your own gifts make yourselves
praised but reserve still to give lest your
deities be despised Lend to each man enough that
one need not lend to another for were your
godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the
gods Make the meat be beloved more than the man
that gives it Let no assembly of twenty be without
a score of villains if there sit twelve women at
the table let a dozen of them beas they are The
rest of your fees O godsthe senators of Athens
together with the common lag of peoplewhat is
amiss in them you gods make suitable for
destruction For these my present friends as they
are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to
nothing are they welcome
Uncover dogs and lap
The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water
What does his lordship mean
I know not
May you a better feast never behold
You knot of mouthfriends I smoke and lukewarm water
Is your perfection This is Timons last
Who stuck and spangled with your flatteries
Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces
Your reeking villany
Throwing the water in their faces
Live loathed and long
Most smiling smooth detested parasites
Courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears
You fools of fortune trencherfriends times flies
Cap and knee slaves vapours and minutejacks
Of man and beast the infinite malady
Crust you quite oer What dost thou go
Soft take thy physic firstthou tooand thou
Stay I will lend thee money borrow none
Throws the dishes at them and drives them out
What all in motion Henceforth be no feast
Whereat a villains not a welcome guest
Burn house sink Athens henceforth hated be
Of Timon man and all humanity
Exit
Reenter the Lords Senators  and c
How now my lords
Know you the quality of Lord Timons fury
Push did you see my cap
I have lost my gown
Hes but a mad lord and nought but humour sways him
He gave me a jewel th other day and now he has
beat it out of my hat did you see my jewel
Did you see my cap
Here tis
Here lies my gown
Lets make no stay
Lord Timons mad
I feel t upon my bones
One day he gives us diamonds next day stones
Exeunt
Enter TIMON
Let me look back upon thee O thou wall
That girdlest in those wolves dive in the earth
And fence not Athens Matrons turn incontinent
Obedience fail in children slaves and fools
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench
And minister in their steads to general filths
Convert o the instant green virginity
Do t in your parents eyes bankrupts hold fast
Rather than render back out with your knives
And cut your trusters throats bound servants steal
Largehanded robbers your grave masters are
And pill by law Maid to thy masters bed
Thy mistress is o the brothel Son of sixteen
pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire
With it beat out his brains Piety and fear
Religion to the gods peace justice truth
Domestic awe nightrest and neighbourhood
Instruction manners mysteries and trades
Degrees observances customs and laws
Decline to your confounding contraries
And let confusion live Plagues incident to men
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
On Athens ripe for stroke Thou cold sciatica
Cripple our senators that their limbs may halt
As lamely as their manners Lust and liberty
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth
That gainst the stream of virtue they may strive
And drown themselves in riot Itches blains
Sow all the Athenian bosoms and their crop
Be general leprosy Breath infect breath
at their society as their friendship may
merely poison Nothing Ill bear from thee
But nakedness thou detestable town
Take thou that too with multiplying bans
Timon will to the woods where he shall find
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind
The gods confoundhear me you good gods all
The Athenians both within and out that wall
And grant as Timon grows his hate may grow
To the whole race of mankind high and low Amen
Exit
Enter FLAVIUS with two or three Servants
Hear you master steward wheres our master
Are we undone cast off nothing remaining
Alack my fellows what should I say to you
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods
I am as poor as you
Such a house broke
So noble a master falln All gone and not
One friend to take his fortune by the arm
And go along with him
As we do turn our backs
From our companion thrown into his grave
So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Slink all away leave their false vows with him
Like empty purses pickd and his poor self
A dedicated beggar to the air
With his disease of allshunnd poverty
Walks like contempt alone More of our fellows
Enter other Servants
All broken implements of a ruind house
Yet do our hearts wear Timons livery
That see I by our faces we are fellows still
Serving alike in sorrow leakd is our bark
And we poor mates stand on the dying deck
Hearing the surges threat we must all part
Into this sea of air
Good fellows all
The latest of my wealth Ill share amongst you
Wherever we shall meet for Timons sake
Lets yet be fellows lets shake our heads and say
As twere a knell unto our masters fortunes
We have seen better days Let each take some
Nay put out all your hands Not one word more
Thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor
Servants embrace and part several ways
O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
Since riches point to misery and contempt
Who would be so mockd with glory or to live
But in a dream of friendship
To have his pomp and all what state compounds
But only painted like his varnishd friends
Poor honest lord brought low by his own heart
Undone by goodness Strange unusual blood
When mans worst sin is he does too much good
Who then dares to be half so kind again
For bounty that makes gods does still mar men
My dearest lord blessd to be most accursed
Rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes
Are made thy chief afflictions Alas kind lord
Hes flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Of monstrous friends nor has he with him to
Supply his life or that which can command it
Ill follow and inquire him out
Ill ever serve his mind with my best will
Whilst I have gold Ill be his steward still
Exit
Enter TIMON from the cave
O blessed breeding sun draw from the earth
Rotten humidity below thy sisters orb
Infect the air Twinnd brothers of one womb
Whose procreation residence and birth
Scarce is dividant touch them with several fortunes
The greater scorns the lesser not nature
To whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune
But by contempt of nature
Raise me this beggar and deny t that lord
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary
The beggar native honour
It is the pasture lards the rothers sides
The want that makes him lean Who dares who dares
In purity of manhood stand upright
And say This mans a flatterer if one be
So are they all for every grise of fortune
Is smoothd by that below the learned pate
Ducks to the golden fool all is oblique
Theres nothing level in our cursed natures
But direct villany Therefore be abhorrd
All feasts societies and throngs of men
His semblable yea himself Timon disdains
Destruction fang mankind Earth yield me roots
Digging
Who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate
With thy most operant poison What is here
Gold yellow glittering precious gold No gods
I am no idle votarist roots you clear heavens
Thus much of this will make black white foul fair
Wrong right base noble old young coward valiant
Ha you gods why this what this you gods Why this
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides
Pluck stout mens pillows from below their heads
This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions bless the accursed
Make the hoar leprosy adored place thieves
And give them title knee and approbation
With senators on the bench this is it
That makes the wappend widow wed again
She whom the spitalhouse and ulcerous sores
Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices
To the April day again Come damned earth
Thou common whore of mankind that putst odds
Among the route of nations I will make thee
Do thy right nature
March afar off
Ha a drum  Thourt quick
But yet Ill bury thee thoult go strong thief
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand
Nay stay thou out for earnest
Keeping some gold
Enter ALCIBIADES with drum and fife in warlike manner PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA
What art thou there speak
A beast as thou art The canker gnaw thy heart
For showing me again the eyes of man
What is thy name Is man so hateful to thee
That art thyself a man
I am Misanthropos and hate mankind
For thy part I do wish thou wert a dog
That I might love thee something
I know thee well
But in thy fortunes am unlearnd and strange
I know thee too and more than that I know thee
I not desire to know Follow thy drum
With mans blood paint the ground gules gules
Religious canons civil laws are cruel
Then what should war be This fell whore of thine
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword
For all her cherubim look
Thy lips rot off
I will not kiss thee then the rot returns
To thine own lips again
How came the noble Timon to this change
As the moon does by wanting light to give
But then renew I could not like the moon
There were no suns to borrow of
Noble Timon
What friendship may I do thee
None but to
Maintain my opinion
What is it Timon
Promise me friendship but perform none if thou
wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art
a man if thou dost perform confound thee for
thou art a man
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries
Thou sawst them when I had prosperity
I see them now then was a blessed time
As thine is now held with a brace of harlots
Is this the Athenian minion whom the world
Voiced so regardfully
Art thou Timandra
Yes
Be a whore still they love thee not that use thee
Give them diseases leaving with thee their lust
Make use of thy salt hours season the slaves
For tubs and baths bring down rosecheeked youth
To the tubfast and the diet
Hang thee monster
Pardon him sweet Timandra for his wits
Are drownd and lost in his calamities
I have but little gold of late brave Timon
The want whereof doth daily make revolt
In my penurious band I have heard and grieved
How cursed Athens mindless of thy worth
Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states
But for thy sword and fortune trod upon them
I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone
I am thy friend and pity thee dear Timon
How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble
I had rather be alone
Why fare thee well
Here is some gold for thee
Keep it I cannot eat it
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap
Warrst thou gainst Athens
Ay Timon and have cause
The gods confound them all in thy conquest
And thee after when thou hast conquerd
Why me Timon
That by killing of villains
Thou wast born to conquer my country
Put up thy gold go onheres goldgo on
Be as a planetary plague when Jove
Will oer some highviced city hang his poison
In the sick air let not thy sword skip one
Pity not honourd age for his white beard
He is an usurer strike me the counterfeit matron
It is her habit only that is honest
Herselfs a bawd let not the virgins cheek
Make soft thy trenchant sword for those milkpaps
That through the windowbars bore at mens eyes
Are not within the leaf of pity writ
But set them down horrible traitors spare not the babe
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy
Think it a bastard whom the oracle
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut
And mince it sans remorse swear against objects
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes
Whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding
Shall pierce a jot Theres gold to pay soldiers
Make large confusion and thy fury spent
Confounded be thyself Speak not be gone
Hast thou gold yet Ill take the gold thou
givest me
Not all thy counsel
Dost thou or dost thou not heavens curse
upon thee
Give us some gold good Timon hast thou more
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade
And to make whores a bawd Hold up you sluts
Your aprons mountant you are not oathable
Although I know you ll swear terribly swear
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
The immortal gods that hear youspare your oaths
Ill trust to your conditions be whores still
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you
Be strong in whore allure him burn him up
Let your close fire predominate his smoke
And be no turncoats yet may your pains six months
Be quite contrary and thatch your poor thin roofs
With burthens of the deadsome that were hangd
No matterwear them betray with them whore still
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face
A pox of wrinkles
Well more gold what then
Believet that well do any thing for gold
Consumptions sow
In hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins
And mar mens spurring Crack the lawyers voice
That he may never more false title plead
Nor sound his quillets shrilly hoar the flamen
That scolds against the quality of flesh
And not believes himself down with the nose
Down with it flat take the bridge quite away
Of him that his particular to foresee
Smells from the general weal make curldpate
ruffians bald
And let the unscarrd braggarts of the war
Derive some pain from you plague all
The source of all erection Theres more gold
Do you damn others and let this damn you
And ditches grave you all
More counsel with more money bounteous Timon
More whore more mischief first I have given you earnest
Strike up the drum towards Athens Farewell Timon
If I thrive well Ill visit thee again
If I hope well Ill never see thee more
I never did thee harm
Yes thou spokest well of me
Callst thou that harm
Men daily find it Get thee away and take
Thy beagles with thee
We but offend him Strike

Engenders the black toad and adder blue
The gilded newt and eyeless venomd worm
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
Whereon Hyperions quickening fire doth shine
Yield him who all thy human sons doth hate
From forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man

Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
Hath to the marbled mansion all above

More man plague plague
I was directed hither men report
Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them
Tis then because thou dost not keep a dog
Whom I would imitate consumption catch thee
This is in thee a nature but infected
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
From change of fortune Why this spade this place
This slavelike habit and these looks of care
Thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft
Hug their diseased perfumes and have forgot
That ever Timon was Shame not these woods
By putting on the cunning of a carper
Be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive
By that which has undone thee hinge thy knee
And let his very breath whom thoult observe
Blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain
And call it excellent thou wast told thus
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
To knaves and all approachers tis most just
That thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again
Rascals should have t Do not assume my likeness
Were I like thee Ild throw away myself
Thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself
A madman so long now a fool What thinkst
That the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain
Will put thy shirt on warm will these mossd trees
That have outlived the eagle page thy heels
And skip where thou pointst out will the
cold brook
Candied with ice caudle thy morning taste
To cure thy oernights surfeit Call the creatures
Whose naked natures live in an the spite
Of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks
To the conflicting elements exposed
Answer mere nature bid them flatter thee
O thou shalt find
A fool of thee depart
I love thee better now than eer I did
I hate thee worse
Why
Thou flatterst misery
I flatter not but say thou art a caitiff
Why dost thou seek me out
To vex thee
Always a villains office or a fools
Dost please thyself int
Ay
What a knave too
If thou didst put this sourcold habit on
To castigate thy pride twere well but thou
Dost it enforcedly thouldst courtier be again
Wert thou not beggar Willing misery
Outlives encertain pomp is crownd before
The one is filling still never complete
The other at high wish best state contentless
Worse than the worst content
Thou shouldst desire to die being miserable
Not by his breath that is more miserable
Thou art a slave whom Fortunes tender arm
With favour never claspd but bred a dog
Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
To such as may the passive drugs of it
Freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself
In general riot melted down thy youth
In different beds of lust and never learnd
The icy precepts of respect but followd
The sugard game before thee But myself
Who had the world as my confectionary
The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men
At duty more than I could frame employment
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
Do on the oak hive with one winters brush
Fell from their boughs and left me open bare
For every storm that blows I to bear this
That never knew but better is some burden
Thy nature did commence in sufferance time
Hath made thee hard int Why shouldst thou hate men
They never flatterd thee what hast thou given
If thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag
Must be thy subject who in spite put stuff
To some she beggar and compounded thee
Poor rogue hereditary Hence be gone
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer
Art thou proud yet
Ay that I am not thee
I that I was
No prodigal
I that I am one now
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee
Ild give thee leave to hang it Get thee gone
That the whole life of Athens were in this
Thus would I eat it
Eating a root
Here I will mend thy feast
Offering him a root
First mend my company take away thyself
So I shall mend mine own by the lack of thine
Tis not well mended so it is but botchd
if not I would it were
What wouldst thou have to Athens
Thee thither in a whirlwind If thou wilt
Tell them there I have gold look so I have
Here is no use for gold
The best and truest
For here it sleeps and does no hired harm
Where liest o nights Timon
Under thats above me
Where feedst thou o days Apemantus
Where my stomach finds meat or rather where I eat
it
Would poison were obedient and knew my mind
Where wouldst thou send it
To sauce thy dishes
The middle of humanity thou never knewest but the
extremity of both ends when thou wast in thy gilt
and thy perfume they mocked thee for too much
curiosity in thy rags thou knowest none but art
despised for the contrary Theres a medlar for
thee eat it
On what I hate I feed not
Dost hate a medlar
Ay though it look like thee
An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner thou shouldst
have loved thyself better now What man didst thou
ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means
Who without those means thou talkest of didst thou
ever know beloved
Myself
I understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a
dog
What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
to thy flatterers
Women nearest but men men are the things
themselves What wouldst thou do with the world
Apemantus if it lay in thy power
Give it the beasts to be rid of the men
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
men and remain a beast with the beasts
Ay Timon
A beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t
attain to If thou wert the lion the fox would
beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would
eat three if thou wert the fox the lion would
suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by
the ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would
torment thee and still thou livedst but as a
breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy
greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst
hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the
unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and
make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert
thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse
wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the
leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to
the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy
defence absence What beast couldst thou be that
were not subject to a beast and what a beast art
thou already that seest not thy loss in
transformation
If thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou
mightst have hit upon it here the commonwealth of
Athens is become a forest of beasts
How has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city
Yonder comes a poet and a painter the plague of
company light upon thee I will fear to catch it
and give way when I know not what else to do Ill
see thee again
When there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be
welcome I had rather be a beggars dog than Apemantus
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
A plague on thee thou art too bad to curse
All villains that do stand by thee are pure
There is no leprosy but what thou speakst
If I name thee
Ill beat thee but I should infect my hands
I would my tongue could rot them off
Away thou issue of a mangy dog
Choler does kill me that thou art alive
I swound to see thee
Would thou wouldst burst
Away
Thou tedious rogue I am sorry I shall lose
A stone by thee
Throws a stone at him
Beast
Slave
Toad
Rogue rogue rogue
I am sick of this false world and will love nought
But even the mere necessities upon t
Then Timon presently prepare thy grave
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
Thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph
That death in me at others lives may laugh
To the gold
O thou sweet kingkiller and dear divorce
Twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler
Of Hymens purest bed thou valiant Mars
Thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
That lies on Dians lap thou visible god
That solderst close impossibilities
And makest them kiss that speakst with
every tongue
To every purpose O thou touch of hearts
Think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue
Set them into confounding odds that beasts
May have the world in empire
Would twere so
But not till I am dead Ill say thoust gold
Thou wilt be throngd to shortly
Throngd to
Ay
Thy back I prithee
Live and love thy misery
Long live so and so die
Exit APEMANTUS
I am quit

Enter Banditti
Where should he have this gold It is some poor
fragment some slender sort of his remainder the
mere want of gold and the fallingfrom of his
friends drove him into this melancholy
It is noised he hath a mass of treasure
Let us make the assay upon him if he care not
fort he will supply us easily if he covetously
reserve it how shalls get it
True for he bears it not about him tis hid
Is not this he
Where
Tis his description
He I know him
Save thee Timon
Now thieves
Soldiers not thieves
Both too and womens sons
We are not thieves but men that much do want
Your greatest want is you want much of meat
Why should you want Behold the earth hath roots
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs
The oaks bear mast the briers scarlet hips
The bounteous housewife nature on each bush
Lays her full mess before you Want why want
We cannot live on grass on berries water
As beasts and birds and fishes
Nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes
You must eat men Yet thanks I must you con
That you are thieves professd that you work not
In holier shapes for there is boundless theft
In limited professions Rascal thieves
Heres gold Go suck the subtle blood o the grape
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth
And so scape hanging trust not the physician
His antidotes are poison and he slays
Moe than you rob take wealth and lives together
Do villany do since you protest to dot
Like workmen Ill example you with thievery
Robs the vast sea the moons an arrant thief
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun
The seas a thief whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears the earths a thief
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement each things a thief
The laws your curb and whip in their rough power
Have unchequed theft Love not yourselves away
Rob one another Theres more gold Cut throats
All that you meet are thieves to Athens go
Break open shops nothing can you steal
But thieves do lose it steal no less for this
I give you and gold confound you howsoeer Amen
Has almost charmed me from my profession by
persuading me to it
Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
us not to have us thrive in our mystery
Ill believe him as an enemy and give over my trade
Let us first see peace in Athens there is no time
so miserable but a man may be true
Exeunt Banditti
Enter FLAVIUS
O you gods
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord
Full of decay and failing O monument
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestowd
What an alteration of honour
Has desperate want made
What viler thing upon the earth than friends
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
How rarely does it meet with this times guise
When man was wishd to love his enemies
Grant I may ever love and rather woo
Those that would mischief me than those that do
Has caught me in his eye I will present
My honest grief unto him and as my lord
Still serve him with my life My dearest master
Away what art thou
Have you forgot me sir
Why dost ask that I have forgot all men
Then if thou grantst thourt a man I have forgot thee
An honest poor servant of yours
Then I know thee not
I never had honest man about me I all
I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains
The gods are witness
Neer did poor steward wear a truer grief
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you
What dost thou weep Come nearer Then I
love thee
Because thou art a woman and disclaimst
Flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
But thorough lust and laughter Pitys sleeping
Strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping
I beg of you to know me good my lord
To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
To entertain me as your steward still
Had I a steward
So true so just and now so comfortable
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild
Let me behold thy face Surely this man
Was born of woman
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness
You perpetualsober gods I do proclaim
One honest manmistake me notbut one
No more I prayand hes a steward
How fain would I have hated all mankind
And thou redeemst thyself but all save thee
I fell with curses
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise
For by oppressing and betraying me
Thou mightst have sooner got another service
For many so arrive at second masters
Upon their first lords neck But tell me true
For I must ever doubt though neer so sure
Is not thy kindness subtle covetous
If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts
Expecting in return twenty for one
No my most worthy master in whose breast
Doubt and suspect alas are placed too late
You should have feard false times when you did feast
Suspect still comes where an estate is least
That which I show heaven knows is merely love
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind
Care of your food and living and believe it
My most honourd lord
For any benefit that points to me
Either in hope or present Ild exchange
For this one wish that you had power and wealth
To requite me by making rich yourself
Look thee tis so Thou singly honest man
Here take the gods out of my misery
Have sent thee treasure Go live rich and happy
But thus conditiond thou shalt build from men
Hate all curse all show charity to none
But let the famishd flesh slide from the bone
Ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs
What thou denyst to men let prisons swallow em
Debts wither em to nothing be men like
blasted woods
And may diseases lick up their false bloods
And so farewell and thrive
O let me stay
And comfort you my master
If thou hatest curses
Stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free
Neer see thou man and let me neer see thee
Exit FLAVIUS TIMON retires to his cave
Enter Poet and Painter TIMON watching them from his cave
As I took note of the place it cannot be far where
he abides
Whats to be thought of him does the rumour hold
for true that hes so full of gold
Certain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and
Timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor
straggling soldiers with great quantity tis said
he gave unto his steward a mighty sum
Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends
Nothing else you shall see him a palm in Athens
again and flourish with the highest Therefore
tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this
supposed distress of his it will show honestly in
us and is very likely to load our purposes with
what they travail for if it be a just true report
that goes of his having
What have you now to present unto him
Nothing at this time but my visitation only I will
promise him an excellent piece
I must serve him so too tell him of an intent
thats coming toward him
Good as the best Promising is the very air o the
time it opens the eyes of expectation
but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the
deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is
most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind
of will or testament which argues a great sickness
in his judgment that makes it
TIMON comes from his cave behind
Aside  Excellent workman thou canst not paint a
man so bad as is thyself
I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
him it must be a personating of himself a satire
against the softness of prosperity with a discovery
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency
Aside  Must thou needs stand for a villain in
thine own work wilt thou whip thine own faults in
other men Do so I have gold for thee
Nay lets seek him
Then do we sin against our own estate
When we may profit meet and come too late
True
When the day serves before blackcornerd night
Find what thou wantst by free and offerd light Come
Aside  Ill meet you at the turn What a
gods gold
That he is worshippd in a baser temple
Than where swine feed
Tis thou that riggst the bark and ploughst the foam
Settlest admired reverence in a slave
To thee be worship and thy saints for aye
Be crownd with plagues that thee alone obey
Fit I meet them
Coming forward
Hail worthy Timon
Our late noble master
Have I once lived to see two honest men
Sir
Having often of your open bounty tasted
Hearing you were retired your friends falln off
Whose thankless naturesO abhorred spirits
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough
What to you
Whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence
To their whole being I am rapt and cannot cover
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
With any size of words
Let it go naked men may seet the better
You that are honest by being what you are
Make them best seen and known
He and myself
Have travaild in the great shower of your gifts
And sweetly felt it
Ay you are honest men
We are hither come to offer you our service
Most honest men Why how shall I requite you
Can you eat roots and drink cold water no
What we can do well do to do you service
Yere honest men yeve heard that I have gold
I am sure you have speak truth yere honest men
So it is said my noble lord but therefore
Came not my friend nor I
Good honest men Thou drawst a counterfeit
Best in all Athens thourt indeed the best
Thou counterfeitst most lively
So so my lord
Een so sir as I say And for thy fiction
Why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
That thou art even natural in thine art
But for all this my honestnatured friends
I must needs say you have a little fault
Marry tis not monstrous in you neither wish I
You take much pains to mend
Beseech your honour
To make it known to us
Youll take it ill
Most thankfully my lord
Will you indeed
Doubt it not worthy lord
Theres never a one of you but trusts a knave
That mightily deceives you
Do we my lord
Ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble
Know his gross patchery love him feed him
Keep in your bosom yet remain assured
That hes a madeup villain
I know none such my lord
Nor I
Look you I love you well Ill give you gold
Rid me these villains from your companies
Hang them or stab them drown them in a draught
Confound them by some course and come to me
Ill give you gold enough
Name them my lord lets know them
You that way and you this but two in company
Each man apart all single and alone
Yet an archvillain keeps him company
If where thou art two villains shall not be
Come not near him If thou wouldst not reside
But where one villain is then him abandon
Hence pack theres gold you came for gold ye slaves
To Painter
You have workd for me theres payment for you hence
To Poet
You are an alchemist make gold of that
Out rascal dogs
Beats them out and then retires to his cave
Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators
It is in vain that you would speak with Timon
For he is set so only to himself
That nothing but himself which looks like man
Is friendly with him
Bring us to his cave
It is our part and promise to the Athenians
To speak with Timon
At all times alike
Men are not still the same twas time and griefs
That framed him thus time with his fairer hand
Offering the fortunes of his former days
The former man may make him Bring us to him
And chance it as it may
Here is his cave
Peace and content be here Lord Timon Timon
Look out and speak to friends the Athenians
By two of their most reverend senate greet thee
Speak to them noble Timon
TIMON comes from his cave
Thou sun that comfortst burn Speak and
be hangd
For each true word a blister and each false
Be as cauterizing to the root o the tongue
Consuming it with speaking
Worthy Timon
Of none but such as you and you of Timon
The senators of Athens greet thee Timon
I thank them and would send them back the plague
Could I but catch it for them
O forget
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee
The senators with one consent of love
Entreat thee back to Athens who have thought
On special dignities which vacant lie
For thy best use and wearing
They confess
Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross
Which now the public body which doth seldom
Play the recanter feeling in itself
A lack of Timons aid hath sense withal
Of its own fail restraining aid to Timon
And send forth us to make their sorrowd render
Together with a recompense more fruitful
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram
Ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
And write in thee the figures of their love
Ever to read them thine
You witch me in it
Surprise me to the very brink of tears
Lend me a fools heart and a womans eyes
And Ill beweep these comforts worthy senators
Therefore so please thee to return with us
And of our Athens thine and ours to take
The captainship thou shalt be met with thanks
Allowd with absolute power and thy good name
Live with authority so soon we shall drive back
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild
Who like a boar too savage doth root up
His countrys peace
And shakes his threatening sword
Against the walls of Athens
Therefore Timon
Well sir I will therefore I will sir thus
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon
That Timon cares not But if be sack fair Athens
And take our goodly aged men by the beards
Giving our holy virgins to the stain
Of contumelious beastly madbraind war
Then let him know and tell him Timon speaks it
In pity of our aged and our youth
I cannot choose but tell him that I care not
And let him taket at worst for their knives care not
While you have throats to answer for myself
Theres not a whittle in the unruly camp
But I do prize it at my love before
The reverendst throat in Athens So I leave you
To the protection of the prosperous gods
As thieves to keepers
Stay not alls in vain
Why I was writing of my epitaph
it will be seen tomorrow my long sickness
Of health and living now begins to mend
And nothing brings me all things Go live still
Be Alcibiades your plague you his
And last so long enough
We speak in vain
But yet I love my country and am not
One that rejoices in the common wreck
As common bruit doth put it
Thats well spoke
Commend me to my loving countrymen
These words become your lips as they pass
thorough them
And enter in our ears like great triumphers
In their applauding gates
Commend me to them
And tell them that to ease them of their griefs
Their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses
Their pangs of love with other incident throes
That natures fragile vessel doth sustain
In lifes uncertain voyage I will some kindness do them
Ill teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades wrath
I like this well he will return again
I have a tree which grows here in my close
That mine own use invites me to cut down
And shortly must I fell it tell my friends
Tell Athens in the sequence of degree
From high to low throughout that whoso please
To stop affliction let him take his haste
Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe
And hang himself I pray you do my greeting
Trouble him no further thus you still shall find him
Come not to me again but say to Athens
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood
Who once a day with his embossed froth
The turbulent surge shall cover thither come
And let my gravestone be your oracle
Lips let sour words go by and language end
What is amiss plague and infection mend
Graves only be mens works and death their gain
Sun hide thy beams Timon hath done his reign
Retires to his cave
His discontents are unremoveably
Coupled to nature
Our hope in him is dead let us return
And strain what other means is left unto us
In our dear peril
It requires swift foot
Exeunt
Enter two Senators and a Messenger
Thou hast painfully discoverd are his files
As full as thy report
have spoke the least
Besides his expedition promises
Present approach
We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon
I met a courier one mine ancient friend
Whom though in general part we were opposed
Yet our old love made a particular force
And made us speak like friends this man was riding
From Alcibiades to Timons cave
With letters of entreaty which imported
His fellowship i the cause against your city
In part for his sake moved
Here come our brothers
Enter the Senators from TIMON
No talk of Timon nothing of him expect
The enemies drum is heard and fearful scouring
Doth choke the air with dust in and prepare
Ours is the fall I fear our foes the snare
Exeunt
Enter a Soldier seeking TIMON
By all description this should be the place
Whos here speak ho No answer What is this
Timon is dead who hath outstretchd his span
Some beast reard this there does not live a man
Dead sure and this his grave Whats on this tomb
Our captain hath in every figure skill
An aged interpreter though young in days
Before proud Athens hes set down by this
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is
Exit
Trumpets sound Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers
Sound to this coward and lascivious town
Our terrible approach
A parley sounded
Enter Senators on the walls
Till now you have gone on and filld the time
With all licentious measure making your wills
The scope of justice till now myself and such
As slept within the shadow of your power
Hav e wanderd with our traversed arms and breathed
Our sufferance vainly now the time is flush
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
Cries of itself No more now breathless wrong
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
And pursy insolence shall break his wind
With fear and horrid flight
Noble and young
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear
We sent to thee to give thy rages balm
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Above their quantity
So did we woo
Transformed Timon to our citys love
By humble message and by promised means
We were not all unkind nor all deserve
The common stroke of war
These walls of ours
Were not erected by their hands from whom
You have received your griefs nor are they such
That these great towers trophies and schools
should fall
For private faults in them
Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out
Shame that they wanted cunning in excess
Hath broke their hearts March noble lord
Into our city with thy banners spread
By decimation and a tithed death
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathestake thou the destined tenth
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Let die the spotted
All have not offended
For those that were it is not square to take
On those that are revenges crimes like lands
Are not inherited Then dear countryman
Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
With those that have offended like a shepherd
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth
But kill not all together
What thou wilt
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
Than hew tot with thy sword
Set but thy foot
Against our rampired gates and they shall ope
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
To say thoult enter friendly
Throw thy glove
Or any token of thine honour else
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
And not as our confusion all thy powers
Shall make their harbour in our town till we
Have seald thy full desire
Then theres my glove
Descend and open your uncharged ports
Those enemies of Timons and mine own
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall and no more and to atone your fears
With my more noble meaning not a man
Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
Of regular justice in your citys bounds
But shall be renderd to your public laws
At heaviest answer
Tis most nobly spoken
Descend and keep your words
The Senators descend and open the gates
Enter Soldier
My noble general Timon is dead
Entombd upon the very hem o the sea
And on his gravestone this insculpture which
With wax I brought away whose soft impression
Interprets for my poor ignorance
Reads the epitaph  Here lies a
wretched corse of wretched soul bereft
Seek not my name a plague consume you wicked
caitiffs left
Here lie I Timon who alive all living men did hate
Pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay
not here thy gait
These well express in thee thy latter spirits
Though thou abhorrdst in us our human griefs
Scorndst our brains flow and those our
droplets which
From niggard nature fall yet rich conceit
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
On thy low grave on faults forgiven Dead
Is noble Timon of whose memory
Hereafter more Bring me into your city
And I will use the olive with my sword
Make war breed peace make peace stint war make each
Prescribe to other as each others leech
Let our drums strike
Exeunt
The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing the Tribunes  and Senators aloft Enter below from one side  SATURNINUS and his Followers and from the other side BASSIANUS and his Followers with drum and colours
Noble patricians patrons of my right
Defend the justice of my cause with arms
And countrymen my loving followers
Plead my successive title with your swords
I am his firstborn son that was the last
That wore the imperial diadem of Rome
Then let my fathers honours live in me
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity
Romans friends followers favorers of my right
If ever Bassianus Caesars son
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome
Keep then this passage to the Capitol
And suffer not dishonour to approach
The imperial seat to virtue consecrate
To justice continence and nobility
But let desert in pure election shine
And Romans fight for freedom in your choice
Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft with the crown
Ambitiously for rule and empery
Know that the people of Rome for whom we stand
A special party have by common voice
In election for the Roman empery
Chosen Andronicus surnamed Pius
For many good and great deserts to Rome
A nobler man a braver warrior
Lives not this day within the city walls
He by the senate is accitd home
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths
That with his sons a terror to our foes
Hath yoked a nation strong traind up in arms
Ten years are spent since first he undertook
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
Our enemies pride five times he hath returnd
Bleeding to Rome bearing his valiant sons
In coffins from the field
And now at last laden with horrors spoils
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome
Renowned Titus flourishing in arms
Let us entreat by honour of his name
Whom worthily you would have now succeed
And in the Capitol and senates right
Whom you pretend to honour and adore
That you withdraw you and abate your strength
Dismiss your followers and as suitors should
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness
How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts
Marcus Andronicus so I do ally
In thy uprightness and integrity
And so I love and honour thee and thine
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all
Gracious Lavinia Romes rich ornament
That I will here dismiss my loving friends
And to my fortunes and the peoples favor
Commit my cause in balance to be weighd
Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS
Friends that have been thus forward in my right
I thank you all and here dismiss you all
And to the love and favor of my country
Commit myself my person and the cause
Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS
Rome be as just and gracious unto me
As I am confident and kind to thee
Open the gates and let me in
Tribunes and me a poor competitor
Flourish SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol
Enter a Captain
Romans make way the good Andronicus
Patron of virtue Romes best champion
Successful in the battles that he fights
With honour and with fortune is returnd
From where he circumscribed with his sword
And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome
Drums and trumpets sounded Enter MARTIUS and  MUTIUS After them two Men bearing a coffin  covered with black then LUCIUS and QUINTUS After  them TITUS ANDRONICUS and then TAMORA with  ALARBUS DEMETRIUS CHIRON AARON and other Goths  prisoners Soldiers and people following The Bearers set down the coffin and TITUS speaks
Hail Rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
Lo as the bark that hath discharged her fraught
Returns with precious jading to the bay
From whence at first she weighd her anchorage
Cometh Andronicus bound with laurel boughs
To resalute his country with his tears
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome
Thou great defender of this Capitol
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend
Romans of five and twenty valiant sons
Half of the number that King Priam had
Behold the poor remains alive and dead
These that survive let Rome reward with love
These that I bring unto their latest home
With burial amongst their ancestors
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword
Titus unkind and careless of thine own
Why sufferst thou thy sons unburied yet
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx
Make way to lay them by their brethren
The tomb is opened
There greet in silence as the dead are wont
And sleep in peace slain in your countrys wars
O sacred receptacle of my joys
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility
How many sons of mine hast thou in store
That thou wilt never render to me more
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths
That we may hew his limbs and on a pile
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
Before this earthy prison of their bones
That so the shadows be not unappeased
Nor we disturbd with prodigies on earth
I give him you the noblest that survives
The eldest son of this distressed queen
Stay Roman brethren Gracious conqueror
Victorious Titus rue the tears I shed
A mothers tears in passion for her son
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee
O think my son to be as dear to me
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
To beautify thy triumphs and return
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke
But must my sons be slaughterd in the streets
For valiant doings in their countrys cause
O if to fight for king and commonweal
Were piety in thine it is in these
Andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
Draw near them then in being merciful
Sweet mercy is nobilitys true badge
Thrice noble Titus spare my firstborn son
Patient yourself madam and pardon me
These are their brethren whom you Goths beheld
Alive and dead and for their brethren slain
Religiously they ask a sacrifice
To this your son is markd and die he must
To appease their groaning shadows that are gone
Away with him and make a fire straight
And with our swords upon a pile of wood
Lets hew his limbs till they be clean consumed
Exeunt LUCIUS QUINTUS MARTIUS and MUTIUS with ALARBUS
O cruel irreligious piety
Was ever Scythia half so barbarous
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome
Alarbus goes to rest and we survive
To tremble under Titus threatening looks
Then madam stand resolved but hope withal
The selfsame gods that armd the Queen of Troy
With opportunity of sharp revenge
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
May favor Tamora the Queen of Goths
When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes
Reenter LUCIUS QUINTUS MARTIUS and MUTIUS with their swords bloody
See lord and father how we have performd
Our Roman rites Alarbus limbs are loppd
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky
Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren
And with loud larums welcome them to Rome
Let it be so and let Andronicus
Make this his latest farewell to their souls
Trumpets sounded and the coffin laid in the tomb
In peace and honour rest you here my sons
Romes readiest champions repose you here in rest
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps
Here lurks no treason here no envy swells
Here grow no damned grudges here are no storms
No noise but silence and eternal sleep
In peace and honour rest you here my sons
Enter LAVINIA
In peace and honour live Lord Titus long
My noble lord and father live in fame
Lo at this tomb my tributary tears
I render for my brethrens obsequies
And at thy feet I kneel with tears of joy
Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome
O bless me here with thy victorious hand
Whose fortunes Romes best citizens applaud
Kind Rome that hast thus lovingly reserved
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart
Lavinia live outlive thy fathers days
And fames eternal date for virtues praise
Enter below MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes reenter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS attended
Long live Lord Titus my beloved brother
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome
Thanks gentle tribune noble brother Marcus
And welcome nephews from successful wars
You that survive and you that sleep in fame
Fair lords your fortunes are alike in all
That in your countrys service drew your swords
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
That hath aspired to Solons happiness
And triumphs over chance in honours bed
Titus Andronicus the people of Rome
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been
Send thee by me their tribune and their trust
This palliament of white and spotless hue
And name thee in election for the empire
With these our latedeceased emperors sons
Be candidatus then and put it on
And help to set a head on headless Rome
A better head her glorious body fits
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness
What should I don this robe and trouble you
Be chosen with proclamations today
Tomorrow yield up rule resign my life
And set abroad new business for you all
Rome I have been thy soldier forty years
And led my countrys strength successfully
And buried one and twenty valiant sons
Knighted in field slain manfully in arms
In right and service of their noble country
Give me a staff of honour for mine age
But not a sceptre to control the world
Upright he held it lords that held it last
Titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery
Proud and ambitious tribune canst thou tell
Patience Prince Saturninus
Romans do me right
Patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not
Till Saturninus be Romes emperor
Andronicus would thou wert shippd to hell
Rather than rob me of the peoples hearts
Proud Saturnine interrupter of the good
That nobleminded Titus means to thee
Content thee prince I will restore to thee
The peoples hearts and wean them from themselves
Andronicus I do not flatter thee
But honour thee and will do till I die
I will most thankful be and thanks to men
Of noble minds is honourable meed
People of Rome and peoples tribunes here
I ask your voices and your suffrages
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus
To gratify the good Andronicus
And gratulate his safe return to Rome
The people will accept whom he admits
Tribunes I thank you and this suit I make
That you create your emperors eldest son
Lord Saturnine whose virtues will I hope
Reflect on Rome as Titans rays on earth
And ripen justice in this commonweal
Then if you will elect by my advice
Crown him and say Long live our emperor
With voices and applause of every sort
Patricians and plebeians we create
Lord Saturninus Romes great emperor
And say Long live our Emperor Saturnine
A long flourish till they come down
Titus Andronicus for thy favors done
To us in our election this day
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness
And for an onset Titus to advance
Thy name and honourable family
Lavinia will I make my empress
Romes royal mistress mistress of my heart
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse
Tell me Andronicus doth this motion please thee
It doth my worthy lord and in this match
I hold me highly honourd of your grace
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine
King and commander of our commonweal
The wide worlds emperor do I consecrate
My sword my chariot and my prisoners
Presents well worthy Romes imperial lord
Receive them then the tribute that I owe
Mine honours ensigns humbled at thy feet
Thanks noble Titus father of my life
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Rome shall record and when I do forget
The least of these unspeakable deserts
Romans forget your fealty to me
To TAMORA  Now madam are you prisoner to
an emperor
To him that for your honour and your state
Will use you nobly and your followers
A goodly lady trust me of the hue
That I would choose were I to choose anew
Clear up fair queen that cloudy countenance
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer
Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome
Princely shall be thy usage every way
Rest on my word and let not discontent
Daunt all your hopes madam he comforts you
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths
Lavinia you are not displeased with this
Not I my lord sith true nobility
Warrants these words in princely courtesy
Thanks sweet Lavinia Romans let us go
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free
Proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum
Flourish SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show
Lord Titus by your leave this maid is mine
Seizing LAVINIA
How sir are you in earnest then my lord
Ay noble Titus and resolved withal
To do myself this reason and this right
Suum cuique is our Roman justice
This prince in justice seizeth but his own
And that he will and shall if Lucius live
Traitors avaunt Where is the emperors guard
Treason my lord Lavinia is surprised
Surprised by whom
By him that justly may
Bear his betrothd from all the world away
Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA
Brothers help to convey her hence away
And with my sword Ill keep this door safe
Exeunt LUCIUS QUINTUS and MARTIUS
Follow my lord and Ill soon bring her back
My lord you pass not here
What villain boy
Barrst me my way in Rome
Stabbing MUTIUS
Help Lucius help
Dies
During the fray SATURNINUS TAMORA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and AARON go out and reenter above
Reenter LUCIUS
My lord you are unjust and more than so
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son
Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine
My sons would never so dishonour me
Traitor restore Lavinia to the emperor
Dead if you will but not to be his wife
That is anothers lawful promised love
Exit
No Titus no the emperor needs her not
Nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock
Ill trust by leisure him that mocks me once
Thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons
Confederates all thus to dishonour me
Was there none else in Rome to make a stale
But Saturnine Full well Andronicus
Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
That saidst I beggd the empire at thy hands
O monstrous what reproachful words are these
But go thy ways go give that changing piece
To him that flourishd for her with his sword
A valiant soninlaw thou shalt enjoy
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome
These words are razors to my wounded heart
And therefore lovely Tamora queen of Goths
That like the stately Phoebe mongst her nymphs
Dost overshine the gallantst dames of Rome
If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice
Behold I choose thee Tamora for my bride
And will create thee empress of Rome
Speak Queen of Goths dost thou applaud my choice
And here I swear by all the Roman gods
Sith priest and holy water are so near
And tapers burn so bright and every thing
In readiness for Hymenaeus stand
I will not resalute the streets of Rome
Or climb my palace till from forth this place
I lead espoused my bride along with me
And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths
She will a handmaid be to his desires
A loving nurse a mother to his youth
Ascend fair queen Pantheon Lords accompany
Your noble emperor and his lovely bride
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered
There shall we consummate our spousal rites
Exeunt all but TITUS
I am not bid to wait upon this bride
Titus when wert thou wont to walk alone
Dishonourd thus and challenged of wrongs
Reenter MARCUS LUCIUS QUINTUS and MARTIUS
O Titus see O see what thou hast done
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son
No foolish tribune no no son of mine
Nor thou nor these confederates in the deed
That hath dishonourd all our family
Unworthy brother and unworthy sons
But let us give him burial as becomes
Give Mutius burial with our brethren
Traitors away he rests not in this tomb
This monument five hundred years hath stood
Which I have sumptuously reedified
Here none but soldiers and Romes servitors
Repose in fame none basely slain in brawls
Bury him where you can he comes not here
My lord this is impiety in you
My nephew Mutius deeds do plead for him
He must be buried with his brethren
And shall or him we will accompany
And shall what villain was it that spake
that word
He that would vouch it in any place but here
What would you bury him in my despite
No noble Titus but entreat of thee
To pardon Mutius and to bury him
Marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest
And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded
My foes I do repute you every one
So trouble me no more but get you gone
He is not with himself let us withdraw
Not I till Mutius bones be buried
MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel
Brother for in that name doth nature plead
Father and in that name doth nature speak
Speak thou no more if all the rest will speed
Renowned Titus more than half my soul
Dear father soul and substance of us all
Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
His noble nephew here in virtues nest
That died in honour and Lavinias cause
Thou art a Roman be not barbarous
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
That slew himself and wise Laertes son
Did graciously plead for his funerals
Let not young Mutius then that was thy joy
Be barrd his entrance here
Rise Marcus rise
The dismallst day is this that eer I saw
To be dishonourd by my sons in Rome
Well bury him and bury me the next
MUTIUS is put into the tomb
There lie thy bones sweet Mutius with thy friends
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb
Kneeling  No man shed tears for noble Mutius
He lives in fame that died in virtues cause
My lord to step out of these dreary dumps
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome
I know not Marcus but I know it is
Whether by device or no the heavens can tell
Is she not then beholding to the man
That brought her for this high good turn so far
Yes and will nobly him remunerate
Flourish Reenter from one side SATURNINUS  attended TAMORA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and AARON from the other BASSIANUS LAVINIA and others
So Bassianus you have playd your prize
God give you joy sir of your gallant bride
And you of yours my lord I say no more
Nor wish no less and so I take my leave
Traitor if Rome have law or we have power
Rape call you it my lord to seize my own
My truthbetrothed love and now my wife
But let the laws of Rome determine all
Meanwhile I am possessd of that is mine
Tis good sir you are very short with us
But if we live well be as sharp with you
My lord what I have done as best I may
Answer I must and shall do with my life
Only thus much I give your grace to know
By all the duties that I owe to Rome
This noble gentleman Lord Titus here
Is in opinion and in honour wrongd
That in the rescue of Lavinia
With his own hand did slay his youngest son
In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
To be controlld in that he frankly gave
Receive him then to favor Saturnine
That hath expressd himself in all his deeds
A father and a friend to thee and Rome
Prince Bassianus leave to plead my deeds
Tis thou and those that have dishonourd me
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
How I have loved and honourd Saturnine
My worthy lord if ever Tamora
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine
Then hear me speak in indifferently for all
And at my suit sweet pardon what is past
What madam be dishonourd openly
And basely put it up without revenge
Not so my lord the gods of Rome forfend
I should be author to dishonour you
But on mine honour dare I undertake
For good Lord Titus innocence in all
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs
Then at my suit look graciously on him
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose
Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart
Aside to SATURNINUS
be won at last
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents
You are but newly planted in your throne
Lest then the people and patricians too
Upon a just survey take Titus part
And so supplant you for ingratitude
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin
Yield at entreats and then let me alone
Ill find a day to massacre them all
The cruel father and his traitorous sons
To whom I sued for my dear sons life
And make them know what tis to let a queen
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain
Aloud
Come come sweet emperor come Andronicus
Take up this good old man and cheer the heart
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown
Rise Titus rise my empress hath prevaild
I thank your majesty and her my lord
These words these looks infuse new life in me
Titus I am incorporate in Rome
A Roman now adopted happily
And must advise the emperor for his good
This day all quarrels die Andronicus
And let it be mine honour good my lord
That I have reconciled your friends and you
For you Prince Bassianus I have passd
My word and promise to the emperor
And fear not lords and you Lavinia
By my advice all humbled on your knees
You shall ask pardon of his majesty
We do and vow to heaven and to his highness
That what we did was mildly as we might
Tendering our sisters honour and our own
That on mine honour here I do protest
Away and talk not trouble us no more
Nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends
The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace
I will not be denied sweet heart look back
Marcus for thy sake and thy brothers here
And at my lovely Tamoras entreats
I do remit these young mens heinous faults Stand up
Lavinia though you left me like a churl
I found a friend and sure as death I swore
I would not part a bachelor from the priest
Come if the emperors court can feast two brides
You are my guest Lavinia and your friends
This day shall be a loveday Tamora
Tomorrow an it please your majesty
To hunt the panther and the hart with me
With horn and hound well give your grace bonjour
Be it so Titus and gramercy too
Flourish Exeunt
Enter AARON
Now climbeth Tamora Olympus top
Safe out of fortunes shot and sits aloft
Secure of thunders crack or lightning flash
Advanced above pale envys threatening reach
As when the golden sun salutes the morn
And having gilt the ocean with his beams
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach
And overlooks the highestpeering hills
So Tamora
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown
Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress
And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
Hast prisoner held fetterd in amorous chains
And faster bound to Aarons charming eyes
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold
To wait upon this newmade empress
To wait said I to wanton with this queen
This goddess this Semiramis this nymph
This siren that will charm Romes Saturnine
And see his shipwreck and his commonweals
Holloa what storm is this
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON braving
Chiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edge
And manners to intrude where I am graced
And may for aught thou knowst affected be
Demetrius thou dost overween in all
And so in this to bear me down with braves
Tis not the difference of a year or two
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate
I am as able and as fit as thou
To serve and to deserve my mistress grace
And that my sword upon thee shall approve
And plead my passions for Lavinias love
Aside  Clubs clubs these lovers will not keep
the peace
Why boy although our mother unadvised
Gave you a dancingrapier by your side
Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
Go to have your lath glued within your sheath
Till you know better how to handle it
Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare
Ay boy grow ye so brave
They draw
Coming forward  Why how now lords
So near the emperors palace dare you draw
And maintain such a quarrel openly
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge
I would not for a million of gold
The cause were known to them it most concerns
Nor would your noble mother for much more
Be so dishonourd in the court of Rome
For shame put up
Not I till I have sheathed
My rapier in his bosom and withal
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here
For that I am prepared and full resolved
Foulspoken coward that thunderst with thy tongue
And with thy weapon nothing darest perform
Away I say
Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore
This petty brabble will undo us all
Why lords and think you not how dangerous
It is to jet upon a princes right
What is Lavinia then become so loose
Or Bassianus so degenerate
That for her love such quarrels may be broachd
Without controlment justice or revenge
Young lords beware and should the empress know
This discords ground the music would not please
I care not I knew she and all the world
I love Lavinia more than all the world
Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice
Lavinia is thine elder brothers hope
Why are ye mad or know ye not in Rome
How furious and impatient they be
And cannot brook competitors in love
I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
By this device
Aaron a thousand deaths
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love
To achieve her how
Why makest thou it so strange
She is a woman therefore may be wood
She is a woman therefore may be won
She is Lavinia therefore must be loved
What man more water glideth by the mill
Than wots the miller of and easy it is
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
Though Bassianus be the emperors brother
Better than he have worn Vulcans badge
Aside  Ay and as good as Saturninus may
Then why should he despair that knows to court it
With words fair looks and liberality
What hast not thou full often struck a doe
And borne her cleanly by the keepers nose
Why then it seems some certain snatch or so
Would serve your turns
Ay so the turn were served
Aaron thou hast hit it
Would you had hit it too
Then should not we be tired with this ado
Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools
To square for this would it offend you then
That both should speed
Faith not me
Nor me so I were one
For shame be friends and join for that you jar
Tis policy and stratagem must do
That you affect and so must you resolve
That what you cannot as you would achieve
You must perforce accomplish as you may
Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste
Than this Lavinia Bassianus love
A speedier course than lingering languishment
Must we pursue and I have found the path
My lords a solemn hunting is in hand
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop
The forest walks are wide and spacious
And many unfrequented plots there are
Fitted by kind for rape and villany
Single you thither then this dainty doe
And strike her home by force if not by words
This way or not at all stand you in hope
Come come our empress with her sacred wit
To villany and vengeance consecrate
Will we acquaint with all that we intend
And she shall file our engines with advice
That will not suffer you to square yourselves
But to your wishes height advance you both
The emperors court is like the house of Fame
The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
There speak and strike brave boys and take
your turns
There serve your lusts shadowd from heavens eye
And revel in Lavinias treasury
Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice
Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream
To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits
Per Styga per manes vehor
Exeunt
Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS with Hunters  and c MARCUS LUCIUS QUINTUS and MARTIUS
The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey
The fields are fragrant and the woods are green
Uncouple here and let us make a bay
And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
And rouse the prince and ring a hunters peal
That all the court may echo with the noise
Sons let it be your charge as it is ours
To attend the emperors person carefully
I have been troubled in my sleep this night
But dawning day new comfort hath inspired
A cry of hounds and horns winded in a peal Enter  SATURNINUS TAMORA BASSIANUS LAVINIA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and Attendants
Many good morrows to your majesty
Madam to you as many and as good
I promised your grace a hunters peal
And you have rung it lustily my lord
Somewhat too early for newmarried ladies
Lavinia how say you
I say no
I have been broad awake two hours and more
Come on then horse and chariots let us have
And to our sport
To TAMORA
Madam now shall ye see
Our Roman hunting
I have dogs my lord
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase
And climb the highest promontory top
And I have horse will follow where the game
Makes way and run like swallows oer the plain
Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground
Exeunt
Enter AARON with a bag of gold
He that had wit would think that I had none
To bury so much gold under a tree
And never after to inherit it
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem
Which cunningly effected will beget
A very excellent piece of villany
And so repose sweet gold for their unrest
Hides the gold
That have their alms out of the empress chest
Enter TAMORA
My lovely Aaron wherefore lookst thou sad
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast
The birds chant melody on every bush
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
And make a chequerd shadow on the ground
Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit
And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds
Replying shrilly to the welltuned horns
As if a double hunt were heard at once
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise
And after conflict such as was supposed
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoyd
When with a happy storm they were surprised
And curtaind with a counselkeeping cave
We may each wreathed in the others arms
Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
Be unto us as is a nurses song
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep
Madam though Venus govern your desires
Saturn is dominator over mine
What signifies my deadlystanding eye
My silence and my cloudy melancholy
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
Even as an adder when she doth unroll
To do some fatal execution
No madam these are no venereal signs
Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head
Hark Tamora the empress of my soul
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee
This is the day of doom for Bassianus
His Philomel must lose her tongue today
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
And wash their hands in Bassianus blood
Seest thou this letter take it up I pray thee
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll
Now question me no more we are espied
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
Which dreads not yet their lives destruction
Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life
No more great empress Bassianus comes
Be cross with him and Ill go fetch thy sons
To back thy quarrels whatsoeer they be
Exit
Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA
Who have we here Romes royal empress
Unfurnishd of her wellbeseeming troop
Or is it Dian habited like her
Who hath abandoned her holy groves
To see the general hunting in this forest
Saucy controller of our private steps
Had I the power that some say Dian had
Thy temples should be planted presently
Should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs
Unmannerly intruder as thou art
Under your patience gentle empress
Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning
And to be doubted that your Moor and you
Are singled forth to try experiments
Jove shield your husband from his hounds today
Tis pity they should take him for a stag
Believe me queen your swarth Cimmerian
Doth make your honour of his bodys hue
Spotted detested and abominable
Why are you sequesterd from all your train
Dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed
And wanderd hither to an obscure plot
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor
If foul desire had not conducted you
And being intercepted in your sport
Great reason that my noble lord be rated
For sauciness I pray you let us hence
And let her joy her ravencolourd love
This valley fits the purpose passing well
The king my brother shall have note of this
Ay for these slips have made him noted long
Good king to be so mightily abused
Why have I patience to endure all this
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan
Have I not reason think you to look pale
These two have ticed me hither to this place
A barren detested vale you see it is
The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
Oercome with moss and baleful mistletoe
Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven
And when they showd me this abhorred pit
They told me here at dead time of the night
A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
Would make such fearful and confused cries
As any mortal body hearing it
Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
No sooner had they told this hellish tale
But straight they told me they would bind me here
Unto the body of a dismal yew
And leave me to this miserable death
And then they calld me foul adulteress
Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms
That ever ear did hear to such effect
And had you not by wondrous fortune come
This vengeance on me had they executed
Revenge it as you love your mothers life
Or be ye not henceforth calld my children
This is a witness that I am thy son
Stabs BASSIANUS
And this for me struck home to show my strength
Also stabs BASSIANUS who dies
Ay come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora
For no name fits thy nature but thy own
Give me thy poniard you shall know my boys
Your mothers hand shall right your mothers wrong
Stay madam here is more belongs to her
First thrash the corn then after burn the straw
This minion stood upon her chastity
Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness
And shall she carry this unto her grave
An if she do I would I were an eunuch
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust
But when ye have the honey ye desire
Let not this wasp outlive us both to sting
I warrant you madam we wil l make that sure
Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy
That nicepreserved honesty of yours
O Tamora thou bearst a womans face
I will not hear her speak away with her
Sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word
Listen fair madam let it be your glory
To see her tears but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain
When did the tigers young ones teach the dam
O do not learn her wrath she taught it thee
The milk thou suckdst from her did turn to marble
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike
To CHIRON
Do thou entreat her show a woman pity
What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark
Yet have I heardO could I find it now
The lion moved with pity did endure
To have his princely paws pared all away
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests
O be to me though thy hard heart say no
Nothing so kind but something pitiful
I know not what it means away with her
O let me teach thee for my fathers sake
That gave thee life when well he might have
slain thee
Be not obdurate open thy deaf ears
Hadst thou in person neer offended me
Even for his sake am I pitiless
Remember boys I pourd forth tears in vain
To save your brother from the sacrifice
But fierce Andronicus would not relent
Therefore away with her and use her as you will
The worse to her the better loved of me
O Tamora be calld a gentle queen
And with thine own hands kill me in this place
For tis not life that I have beggd so long
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died
What beggst thou then fond woman let me go
Tis present death I beg and one thing more
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell
O keep me from their worse than killing lust
And tumble me into some loathsome pit
Where never mans eye may behold my body
Do this and be a charitable murderer
So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee
No let them satisfy their lust on thee
Away for thou hast stayd us here too long
No grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature
The blot and enemy to our general name
Confusion fall
Nay then Ill stop your mouth Bring thou her husband
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him
DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the  pit then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON dragging off LAVINIA
Farewell my sons see that you make her sure
Neer let my heart know merry cheer indeed
Till all the Andronici be made away
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflowr
Exit
Reenter AARON with QUINTUS and MARTIUS
Come on my lords the better foot before
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
Where I espied the panther fast asleep
My sight is very dull whateer it bodes
And mine I promise you weret not for shame
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile
Falls into the pit
What art thou falln What subtle hole is this
Whose mouth is coverd with rudegrowing briers
Upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood
As fresh as morning dew distilld on flowers
A very fatal place it seems to me
Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall
O brother with the dismallst object hurt
That ever eye with sight made heart lament
Aside  Now will I fetch the king to find them here
That he thereby may give a likely guess
How these were they that made away his brother
Exit
Why dost not comfort me and help me out
From this unhallowed and bloodstained hole
I am surprised with an uncouth fear
A chilling sweat oerruns my trembling joints
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see
To prove thou hast a truedivining heart
Aaron and thou look down into this den
And see a fearful sight of blood and death
Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise
O tell me how it is for neer till now
Was I a child to fear I know not what
Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here
All on a heap like to a slaughterd lamb
In this detested dark blooddrinking pit
If it be dark how dost thou know tis he
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
A precious ring that lightens all the hole
Which like a taper in some monument
Doth shine upon the dead mans earthy cheeks
And shows the ragged entrails of the pit
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood
O brother help me with thy fainting hand
If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath
Out of this fell devouring receptacle
As hateful as Cocytus misty mouth
Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out
Or wanting strength to do thee so much good
I may be pluckd into the swallowing womb
Of this deep pit poor Bassianus grave
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help
Thy hand once more I will not loose again
Till thou art here aloft or I below
Thou canst not come to me I come to thee
Falls in
Enter SATURNINUS with AARON
Along with me Ill see what hole is here
And what he is that now is leapd into it
Say who art thou that lately didst descend
Into this gaping hollow of the earth
The unhappy son of old Andronicus
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour
To find thy brother Bassianus dead
My brother dead I know thou dost but jest
He and his lady both are at the lodge
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase
Tis not an hour since I left him there
We know not where you left him all alive
But out alas here have we found him dead
Reenter TAMORA with Attendants TITUS ANDRONICUS and Lucius
Where is my lord the king
Here Tamora though grieved with killing grief
Where is thy brother Bassianus
Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered
Then all too late I bring this fatal writ
The complot of this timeless tragedy
And wonder greatly that mans face can fold
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
She giveth SATURNINUS a letter
Reads  An if we miss to meet him handsomely
Sweet huntsman Bassianus tis we mean
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him
Thou knowst our meaning Look for thy reward
Among the nettles at the eldertree
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus
Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends
O Tamora was ever heard the like
This is the pit and this the eldertree
Look sirs if you can find the huntsman out
That should have murdered Bassianus here
My gracious lord here is the bag of gold
To TITUS  Two of thy whelps fell curs of
bloody kind
Have here bereft my brother of his life
Sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
There let them bide until we have devised
Some neverheardof torturing pain for them
What are they in this pit O wondrous thing
How easily murder is discovered
High emperor upon my feeble knee
I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed
That this fell fault of my accursed sons
Accursed if the fault be proved in them
If it be proved you see it is apparent
Who found this letter Tamora was it you
Andronicus himself did take it up
I did my lord yet let me be their bail
For by my fathers reverend tomb I vow
They shall be ready at your highness will
To answer their suspicion with their lives
Thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me
Some bring the murderd body some the murderers
Let them not speak a word the guilt is plain
For by my soul were there worse end than death
That end upon them should be executed
Andronicus I will entreat the king
Fear not thy sons they shall do well enough
Come Lucius come stay not to talk with them
Exeunt
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA ravished her hands cut off and her tongue cut out
So now go tell an if thy tongue can speak
Who twas that cut thy tongue and ravishd thee
Write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe
See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl
Go home call for sweet water wash thy hands
She hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
And so lets leave her to her silent walks
An twere my case I should go hang myself
If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
Enter MARCUS
Who is this my niece that flies away so fast
Cousin a word where is your husband
If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me
If I do wake some planet strike me down
That I may slumber in eternal sleep
Speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands
Have loppd and hewd and made thy body bare
Of her two branches those sweet ornaments
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
And might not gain so great a happiness
As have thy love Why dost not speak to me
Alas a crimson river of warm blood
Like to a bubbling fountain stirrd with wind
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips
Coming and going with thy honey breath
But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee
And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
Ah now thou turnst away thy face for shame
And notwithstanding all this loss of blood
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titans face
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud
Shall I speak for thee shall I say tis so
O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast
That I might rail at him to ease my mind
Sorrow concealed like an oven stoppd
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is
Fair Philomela she but lost her tongue
And in a tedious sampler sewd her mind
But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
That could have better sewd than Philomel
O had the monster seen those lily hands
Tremble like aspenleaves upon a lute
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them
He would not then have touchd them for his life
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
Which that sweet tongue hath made
He would have droppd his knife and fell asleep
As Cerberus at the Thracian poets feet
Come let us go and make thy father blind
For such a sight will blind a fathers eye
One hours storm will drown the fragrant meads
What will whole months of tears thy fathers eyes
Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee
O could our mourning ease thy misery
Exeunt
Enter Judges Senators and Tribunes with MARTIUS  and QUINTUS bound passing on to the place of execution TITUS going before pleading
Hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
For pity of mine age whose youth was spent
In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
For all my blood in Romes great quarrel shed
For all the frosty nights that I have watchd
And for these bitter tears which now you see
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks
Be pitiful to my condemned sons
Whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought
For two and twenty sons I never wept
Because they died in honours lofty bed
Lieth down the Judges  and c pass by him and Exeunt
For these these tribunes in the dust I write
My hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears
Let my tears stanch the earths dry appetite
My sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush
O earth I will befriend thee more with rain
That shall distil from these two ancient urns
Than youthful April shall with all his showers
In summers drought Ill drop upon thee still
In winter with warm tears Ill melt the snow
And keep eternal springtime on thy face
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood
Enter LUCIUS with his sword drawn
O reverend tribunes O gentle aged men
Unbind my sons reverse the doom of death
And let me say that never wept before
My tears are now prevailing orators
O noble father you lament in vain
The tribunes hear you not no man is by
And you recount your sorrows to a stone
Ah Lucius for thy brothers let me plead
Grave tribunes once more I entreat of you
My gracious lord no tribune hears you speak
Why tis no matter man if they did hear
They would not mark me or if they did mark
They would not pity me yet plead I must
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones
Who though they cannot answer my distress
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes
For that they will not intercept my tale
When I do weep they humbly at my feet
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me
And were they but attired in grave weeds
Rome could afford no tribune like to these
A stone is soft as waxtribunes more hard than stones
A stone is silent and offendeth not
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death
Rises
But wherefore standst thou with thy weapon drawn
To rescue my two brothers from their death
For which attempt the judges have pronounced
My everlasting doom of banishment
O happy man they have befriended thee
Why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers
Tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey
But me and mine how happy art thou then
From these devourers to be banished
But who comes with our brother Marcus here
Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA
Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep
Or if not so thy noble heart to break
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age
Will it consume me let me see it then
This was thy daughter
Why Marcus so she is
Ay me this object kills me
Fainthearted boy arise and look upon her
Speak Lavinia what accursed hand
Hath made thee handless in thy fathers sight
What fool hath added water to the sea
Or brought a faggot to brightburning Troy
My grief was at the height before thou camest
And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds
Give me a sword Ill chop off my hands too
For they have fought for Rome and all in vain
And they have nursed this woe in feeding life
In bootless prayer have they been held up
And they have served me to effectless use
Now all the service I require of them
Is that the one will help to cut the other
Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands
For hands to do Rome service are but vain
Speak gentle sister who hath martyrd thee
O that delightful engine of her thoughts
That blabbd them with such pleasing eloquence
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
Sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
O say thou for her who hath done this deed
O thus I found her straying in the park
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
That hath received some unrecuring wound
It was my deer and he that wounded her
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead
For now I stand as one upon a rock
Environed with a wilderness of sea
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
Expecting ever when some envious surge
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him
This way to death my wretched sons are gone
Here stands my other son a banished man
And here my brother weeping at my woes
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
Is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
It would have madded me what shall I do
Now I behold thy lively body so
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyrd thee
Thy husband he is dead and for his death
Thy brothers are condemnd and dead by this
Look Marcus ah son Lucius look on her
When I did name her brothers then fresh tears
Stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew
Upon a gatherd lily almost witherd
Perchance she weeps because they killd her husband
Perchance because she knows them innocent
If they did kill thy husband then be joyful
Because the law hath taen revenge on them
No no they would not do so foul a deed
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes
Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease
Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
And thou and I sit round about some fountain
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
How they are staind as meadows yet not dry
With miry slime left on them by a flood
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
And made a brinepit with our bitter tears
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine
Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
Pass the remainder of our hateful days
What shall we do let us that have our tongues
Plot some deuce of further misery
To make us wonderd at in time to come
Sweet father cease your tears for at your grief
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps
Patience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyes
Ah Marcus Marcus brother well I wot
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
For thou poor man hast drownd it with thine own
Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks
Mark Marcus mark I understand her signs
Had she a tongue to speak now would she say
That to her brother which I said to thee
His napkin with his true tears all bewet
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
O what a sympathy of woe is this
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss
Enter AARON
Titus Andronicus my lord the emperor
Sends thee this wordthat if thou love thy sons
Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus
Or any one of you chop off your hand
And send it to the king he for the same
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive
And that shall be the ransom for their fault
O gracious emperor O gentle Aaron
Did ever raven sing so like a lark
That gives sweet tidings of the suns uprise
With all my heart Ill send the emperor My hand
Good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off
Stay father for that noble hand of thine
That hath thrown down so many enemies
Shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn
My youth can better spare my blood than you
And therefore mine shall save my brothers lives
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
And reard aloft the bloody battleaxe
Writing destruction on the enemys castle
O none of both but are of high desert
My hand hath been but idle let it serve
To ransom my two nephews from their death
Then have I kept it to a worthy end
Nay come agree whose hand shall go along
For fear they die before their pardon come
My hand shall go
By heaven it shall not go
Sirs strive no more such witherd herbs as these
Are meet for plucking up and therefore mine
Sweet father if I shall be thought thy son
Let me redeem my brothers both from death
And for our fathers sake and mothers care
Now let me show a brothers love to thee
Agree between you I will spare my hand
Then Ill go fetch an axe
But I will use the axe
Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS
Come hither Aaron Ill deceive them both
Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine
Aside  If that be calld deceit I will be honest
And never whilst I live deceive men so
But Ill deceive you in another sort
And that youll say ere half an hour pass
Cuts off TITUSs hand
Reenter LUCIUS and MARCUS
Now stay your strife what shall be is dispatchd
Good Aaron give his majesty my hand
Tell him it was a hand that warded him
From thousand dangers bid him bury it
More hath it merited that let it have
As for my sons say I account of them
As jewels purchased at an easy price
And yet dear too because I bought mine own
I go Andronicus and for thy hand
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee
Aside
Their heads I mean O how this villany
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
Let fools do good and fair men call for grace
Aaron will have his soul black like his face
Exit
O here I lift this one hand up to heaven
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth
If any power pities wretched tears
To that I call
To LAVINIA
What wilt thou kneel with me
Do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers
Or with our sighs well breathe the welkin dim
And stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms
O brother speak with possibilities
And do not break into these deep extremes
Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom
Then be my passions bottomless with them
But yet let reason govern thy lament
If there were reason for these miseries
Then into limits could I bind my woes
When heaven doth weep doth not the earth oerflow
If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad
Threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil
I am the sea hark how her sighs do blow
She is the weeping welkin I the earth
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs
Then must my earth with her continual tears
Become a deluge overflowd and drownd
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes
But like a drunkard must I vomit them
Then give me leave for losers will have leave
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues
Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand
Worthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid
For that good hand thou sentst the emperor
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons
And heres thy hand in scorn to thee sent back
Thy griefs their sports thy resolution mockd
That woe is me to think upon thy woes
More than remembrance of my fathers death
Exit
Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily
And be my heart an everburning hell
These miseries are more than may be borne
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal
But sorrow flouted at is double death
Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound
And yet detested life not shrink thereat
That ever death should let life bear his name
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe
LAVINIA kisses TITUS
Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless
As frozen water to a starved snake
When will this fearful slumber have an end
Now farewell flattery die Andronicus
Thou dost not slumber see thy two sons heads
Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here
Thy other banishd son with this dear sight
Struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I
Even like a stony image cold and numb
Ah now no more will I control thy griefs
Rend off thy silver hair thy other hand
Gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight
The closing up of our most wretched eyes
Now is a time to storm why art thou still
Ha ha ha
Why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour
Why I have not another tear to shed
Besides this sorrow is an enemy
And would usurp upon my watery eyes
And make them blind with tributary tears
Then which way shall I find Revenges cave
For these two heads do seem to speak to me
And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Till all these mischiefs be returnd again
Even in their throats that have committed them
Come let me see what task I have to do
You heavy people circle me about
That I may turn me to each one of you
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs
The vow is made Come brother take a head
And in this hand the other I will bear
Lavinia thou shalt be employd these arms
Bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth
As for thee boy go get thee from my sight
Thou art an exile and thou must not stay
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there
And if you love me as I think you do
Lets kiss and part for we have much to do
Exeunt TITUS MARCUS and LAVINIA
Farewell Andronicus my noble father
The wofullst man that ever lived in Rome
Farewell proud Rome till Lucius come again
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life
Farewell Lavinia my noble sister
O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
But in oblivion and hateful griefs
If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs
And make proud Saturnine and his empress
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen
Now will I to the Goths and raise a power
To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine
Exit
Enter TITUS MARCUS LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS a boy
So so now sit and look you eat no more
Than will preserve just so much strength in us
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours
Marcus unknit that sorrowwreathen knot
Thy niece and I poor creatures want our hands
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
With folded arms This poor right hand of mine
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast
Who when my heart all mad with misery
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh
Then thus I thump it down
To LAVINIA
Thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still
Wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans
Or get some little knife between thy teeth
And just against thy heart make thou a hole
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
May run into that sink and soaking in
Drown the lamenting fool in seasalt tears
Fie brother fie teach her not thus to lay
Such violent hands upon her tender life
How now has sorrow made thee dote already
Why Marcus no man should be mad but I
What violent hands can she lay on her life
Ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands
To bid AEneas tell the tale twice oer
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable
O handle not the theme to talk of hands
Lest we remember still that we have none
Fie fie how franticly I square my talk
As if we should forget we had no hands
If Marcus did not name the word of hands
Come lets fall to and gentle girl eat this
Here is no drink Hark Marcus what she says
I can interpret all her martyrd signs
She says she drinks no other drink but tears
Brewd with her sorrow meshd upon her cheeks
Speechless complainer I will learn thy thought
As begging hermits in their holy prayers
Thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven
Nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign
But I of these will wrest an alphabet
Good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale
Alas the tender boy in passion moved
Doth weep to see his grandsires heaviness
Peace tender sapling thou art made of tears
And tears will quickly melt thy life away
MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife
What dost thou strike at Marcus with thy knife
At that that I have killd my lord a fly
Out on thee murderer thou killst my heart
Mine eyes are cloyd with view of tyranny
A deed of death done on the innocent
Becomes not Titus brother get thee gone
I see thou art not for my company
Alas my lord I have but killd a fly
But how if that fly had a father and mother
How would he hang his slender gilded wings
And buzz lamenting doings in the air
Poor harmless fly
That with his pretty buzzing melody
Came here to make us merry and thou hast
killd him
Pardon me sir it was a black illfavord fly
Like to the empress Moor therefore I killd him
O O O
Then pardon me for reprehending thee
For thou hast done a charitable deed
Give me thy knife I will insult on him
Flattering myself as if it were the Moor
Come hither purposely to poison me
Theres for thyself and thats for Tamora
Ah sirrah
Yet I think we are not brought so low
But that between us we can kill a fly
That comes in likeness of a coalblack Moor
Alas poor man grief has so wrought on him
He takes false shadows for true substances
Come take away Lavinia go with me
Ill to thy closet and go read with thee
Sad stories chanced in the times of old
Come boy and go with me thy sight is young
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle
Exeunt
Enter young LUCIUS and LAVINIA running after him  and the boy flies from her with books under his arm Then enter TITUS and MARCUS
Help grandsire help my aunt Lavinia
Follows me every where I know not why
Good uncle Marcus see how swift she comes
Alas sweet aunt I know not what you mean
Stand by me Lucius do not fear thine aunt
She loves thee boy too well to do thee harm
Ay when my father was in Rome she did
What means my niece Lavinia by these signs
Fear her not Lucius somewhat doth she mean
See Lucius see how much she makes of thee
Somewhither would she have thee go with her
Ah boy Cornelia never with more care
Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
Sweet poetry and Tullys Orator
Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus
My lord I know not I nor can I guess
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft
Extremity of griefs would make men mad
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
Ran mad through sorrow that made me to fear
Although my lord I know my noble aunt
Loves me as dear as eer my mother did
And would not but in fury fright my youth
Which made me down to throw my books and fly
Causeless perhaps But pardon me sweet aunt
And madam if my uncle Marcus go
I will most willingly attend your ladyship
Lucius I will
LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall
How now Lavinia Marcus what means this
Some book there is that she desires to see
Which is it girl of these Open them boy
But thou art deeper read and better skilld
Come and take choice of all my library
And so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens
Reveal the damnd contriver of this deed
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus
I think she means that there was more than one
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge
Lucius what book is that she tosseth so
Grandsire tis Ovids Metamorphoses
My mother gave it me
For love of her thats gone
Perhaps she culld it from among the rest
Soft see how busily she turns the leaves
Helping her
What would she find Lavinia shall I read
This is the tragic tale of Philomel
And treats of Tereus treason and his rape
And rape I fear was root of thine annoy
See brother see note how she quotes the leaves
Lavinia wert thou thus surprised sweet girl
Ravishd and wrongd as Philomela was
Forced in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods See see
Ay such a place there is where we did hunt
O had we never never hunted there
Patternd by that the poet here describes
By nature made for murders and for rapes
O why should nature build so foul a den
Unless the gods delight in tragedies
Give signs sweet girl for here are none
but friends
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed
Or slunk not Saturnine as Tarquin erst
That left the camp to sin in Lucrece bed
Sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me
Apollo Pallas Jove or Mercury
Inspire me that I may this treason find
My lord look here look here Lavinia
This sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst
This after me when I have writ my name
Without the help of any hand at all
He writes his name with his staff and guides it with feet and mouth
Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift
Write thou good niece and here display at last
What God will have discoverd for revenge
Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain
That we may know the traitors and the truth
She takes the staff in her mouth and guides it with her stumps and writes
O do ye read my lord what she hath writ
Stuprum Chiron Demetrius
What what the lustful sons of Tamora
Performers of this heinous bloody deed
Magni Dominator poli
Tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides
O calm thee gentle lord although I know
There is enough written upon this earth
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims
My lord kneel down with me Lavinia kneel
And kneel sweet boy the Roman Hectors hope
And swear with me as with the woful fere
And father of that chaste dishonourd dame
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece rape
That we will prosecute by good advice
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths
And see their blood or die with this reproach
Tis sure enough an you knew how
But if you hunt these bearwhelps then beware
The dam will wake and if she wind you once
Shes with the lion deeply still in league
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back
And when he sleeps will she do what she list
You are a young huntsman Marcus let it alone
And come I will go get a leaf of brass
And with a gad of steel will write these words
And lay it by the angry northern wind
Will blow these sands like Sibyls leaves abroad
And wheres your lesson then Boy what say you
I say my lord that if I were a man
Their mothers bedchamber should not be safe
For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome
Ay thats my boy thy father hath full oft
For his ungrateful country done the like
And uncle so will I an if I live
Come go with me into mine armoury
Lucius Ill fit thee and withal my boy
Shalt carry from me to the empress sons
Presents that I intend to send them both
Come come thoult do thy message wilt thou not
Ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire
No boy not so Ill teach thee another course
Lavinia come Marcus look to my house
Lucius and Ill go brave it at the court
Ay marry will we sir and well be waited on
Exeunt TITUS LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS
O heavens can you hear a good man groan
And not relent or not compassion him
Marcus attend him in his ecstasy
That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
Than foemens marks upon his batterd shield
But yet so just that he will not revenge
Revenge ye heavens for old Andronicus
Exit
Enter from one side AARON DEMETRIUS and  CHIRON from the other side Young LUCIUS and an  Attendant with a bundle of weapons and verses writ upon them
Demetrius heres the son of Lucius
He hath some message to deliver us
Ay some mad message from his mad grandfather
My lords with all the humbleness I may
I greet your honours from Andronicus
Aside
And pray the Roman gods confound you both
Gramercy lovely Lucius whats the news
Aside  That you are both decipherd thats the news
For villains markd with rapeMay it please you
My grandsire well advised hath sent by me
The goodliest weapons of his armoury
To gratify your honourable youth
The hope of Rome for so he bade me say
And so I do and with his gifts present
Your lordships that whenever you have need
You may be armed and appointed well
And so I leave you both
Aside
like bloody villains
Exeunt Young LUCIUS and Attendant
Whats here A scroll and written round about
Lets see
Reads
Integer vitae scelerisque purus
Non eget Mauri jaculis nec arcu
O tis a verse in Horace I know it well
I read it in the grammar long ago
Ay just a verse in Horace right you have it
Aside
Now what a thing it is to be an ass
Heres no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt
And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines
That wound beyond their feeling to the quick
But were our witty empress well afoot
She would applaud Andronicus conceit
But let her rest in her unrest awhile
And now young lords wast not a happy star
Led us to Rome strangers and more than so
Captives to be advanced to this height
It did me good before the palace gate
To brave the tribune in his brothers hearing
But me more good to see so great a lord
Basely insinuate and send us gifts
Had he not reason Lord Demetrius
Did you not use his daughter very friendly
I would we had a thousand Roman dames
At such a bay by turn to serve our lust
A charitable wish and full of love
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen
And that would she for twenty thousand more
Come let us go and pray to all the gods
For our beloved mother in her pains
Aside  Pray to the devils the gods have given us over
Trumpets sound within
Why do the emperors trumpets flourish thus
Belike for joy the emperor hath a son
Soft who comes here
Enter a Nurse with a blackamoor Child in her arms
Good morr ow lords
O tell me did you see Aaron the Moor
Well more or less or neer a whit at all
Here Aaron is and what with Aaron now
O gentle Aaron we are all undone
Now help or woe betide thee evermore
Why what a caterwauling dost thou keep
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms
O that which I would hide from heavens eye
Our empress shame and stately Romes disgrace
She is deliverd lords she is deliverd
To whom
I mean she is brought abed
Well God give her good rest What hath he sent her
A devil
Why then she is the devils dam a joyful issue
A joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue
Here is the babe as loathsome as a toad
Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime
The empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal
And bids thee christen it with thy daggers point
Zounds ye whore is black so base a hue
Sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure
Villain what hast thou done
That which thou canst not undo
Thou hast undone our mother
Villain I have done thy mother
And therein hellish dog thou hast undone
Woe to her chance and damnd her loathed choice
Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend
It shall not live
It shall not die
Aaron it must the mother wills it so
What must it nurse then let no man but I
Do execution on my flesh and blood
Ill broach the tadpole on my rapiers point
Nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it
Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up
Takes the Child from the Nurse and draws
Stay murderous villains will you kill your brother
Now by the burning tapers of the sky
That shone so brightly when this boy was got
He dies upon my scimitars sharp point
That touches this my firstborn son and heir
I tell you younglings not Enceladus
With all his threatening band of Typhons brood
Nor great Alcides nor the god of war
Shall seize this prey out of his fathers hands
What what ye sanguine shallowhearted boys
Ye whitelimed walls ye alehouse painted signs
Coalblack is better than another hue
In that it scorns to bear another hue
For all the water in the ocean
Can never turn the swans black legs to white
Although she lave them hourly in the flood
Tell the empress from me I am of age
To keep mine own excuse it how she can
Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus
My mistress is my mistress this myself
The vigour and the picture of my youth
This before all the world do I prefer
This maugre all the world will I keep safe
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome
By this our mother is forever shamed
Rome will despise her for this foul escape
The emperor in his rage will doom her death
I blush to think upon this ignomy
Why theres the privilege your beauty bears
Fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing
Heres a young lad framed of another leer
Look how the black slave smiles upon the father
As who should say Old lad I am thine own
He is your brother lords sensibly fed
Of that selfblood that first gave life to you
And from that womb where you imprisond were
He is enfranchised and come to light
Nay he is your brother by the surer side
Although my seal be stamped in his face
Aaron what shall I say unto the empress
Advise thee Aaron what is to be done
And we will all subscribe to thy advice
Save thou the child so we may all be safe
Then sit we down and let us all consult
My son and I will have the wind of you
Keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety
They sit
How many women saw this child of his
Why so brave lords when we join in league
I am a lamb but if you brave the Moor
The chafed boar the mountain lioness
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms
But say again how many saw the child
Cornelia the midwife and myself
And no one else but the deliverd empress
The empress the midwife and yourself
Two may keep counsel when the thirds away
Go to the empress tell her this I said
He kills the nurse
Weke weke so cries a pig prepared to the spit
What meanst thou Aaron wherefore didst thou this
O Lord sir tis a deed of policy
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours
A longtongued babbling gossip no lords no
And now be it known to you my full intent
Not far one Muli lives my countryman
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed
His child is like to her fair as you are
Go pack with him and give the mother gold
And tell them both the circumstance of all
And how by this their child shall be advanced
And be received for the emperors heir
And substituted in the place of mine
To calm this tempest whirling in the court
And let the emperor dandle him for his own
Hark ye lords ye see I have given her physic
Pointing to the nurse
And you must needs bestow her funeral
The fields are near and you are gallant grooms
This done see that you take no longer days
But send the midwife presently to me
The midwife and the nurse well made away
Then let the ladies tattle what they please
Aaron I see thou wilt not trust the air
With secrets
For this care of Tamora
Herself and hers are highly bound to thee
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the Nurses body
Now to the Goths as swift as swallow flies
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms
And secretly to greet the empress friends
Come on you thick lippd slave Ill bear you hence
For it is you that puts us to our shifts
Ill make you feed on berries and on roots
And feed on curds and whey and suck the goat
And cabin in a cave and bring you up
To be a warrior and command a camp
Exit
Enter TITUS bearing arrows with letters at the  ends of them with him MARCUS Young LUCIUS  PUBLIUS SEMPRONIUS CAIUS and other Gentlemen with bows
Come Marcus come kinsmen this is the way
Sir boy now let me see your archery
Look ye draw home enough and tis there straight
Terras Astraea reliquit
Be you rememberd Marcus shes gone shes fled
Sirs take you to your tools You cousins shall
Go sound the ocean and cast your nets
Happily you may catch her in the sea
Yet theres as little justice as at land
No Publius and Sempronius you must do it
Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth
Then when you come to Plutos region
I pray you deliver him this petition
Tell him it is for justice and for aid
And that it comes from old Andronicus
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome
Ah Rome Well well I made thee miserable
What time I threw the peoples suffrages
On him that thus doth tyrannize oer me
Go get you gone and pray be careful all
And leave you not a manofwar unsearchd
This wicked emperor may have shippd her hence
And kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice
O Publius is not this a heavy case
Therefore my lord it highly us concerns
By day and night to attend him carefully
And feed his humour kindly as we may
Till time beget some careful remedy
Kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
Join with the Goths and with revengeful war
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine
Publius how now how now my masters
What have you met with her
No my good lord but Pluto sends you word
If you will have Revenge from hell you shall
Marry for Justice she is so employd
He thinks with Jove in heaven or somewhere else
So that perforce you must needs stay a time
He doth me wrong to feed me with delays
Ill dive into the burning lake below
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels
Marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we
No bigboned men framed of the Cyclops size
But metal Marcus steel to the very back
Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear
And sith theres no justice in earth nor hell
We will solicit heaven and move the gods
To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs
Come to this gear You are a good archer Marcus
He gives them the arrows
Ad Jovem thats for you here Ad Apollinem
Ad Martem thats for myself
Here boy to Pallas here to Mercury
To Saturn Caius not to Saturnine
You were as good to shoot against the wind
To it boy Marcus loose when I bid
Of my word I have written to effect
Theres not a god left unsolicited
Kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court
We will afflict the emperor in his pride
Now masters draw
They shoot
O well said Lucius
Good boy in Virgos lap give it Pallas
My lord I aim a mile beyond the moon
Your letter is with Jupiter by this
Ha ha
Publius Publius what hast thou done
See see thou hast shot off one of Taurus horns
This was the sport my lord when Publius shot
The Bull being galld gave Aries such a knock
That down fell both the Rams horns in the court
And who should find them but the empress villain
She laughd and told the Moor he should not choose
But give them to his master for a present
Why there it goes God give his lordship joy
Enter a Clown with a basket and two pigeons in it
News news from heaven Marcus the post is come
Sirrah what tidings have you any letters
Shall I have justice what says Jupiter
O the gibbetmaker he says that he hath taken
them down again for the man must not be hanged till
the next week
But what says Jupiter I ask thee
Alas sir I know not Jupiter I never drank with him
in all my life
Why villain art not thou the carrier
Ay of my pigeons sir nothing else
Why didst thou not come from heaven
From heaven alas sir I never came there     God
forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
young days Why I am going with my pigeons to the
tribunal plebs to take up a matter of brawl
betwixt my uncle and one of the emperials men
Why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for
your oration and let him deliver the pigeons to
the emperor from you
Tell me can you deliver an oration to the emperor
with a grace
Nay truly sir I could never say grace in all my life
Sirrah come hither make no more ado
But give your pigeons to the emperor
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands
Hold hold meanwhile heres money for thy charges
Give me pen and ink Sirrah can you with a grace
deliver a supplication
Ay sir
Then here is a supplication for you And when you
come to him at the first approach you must kneel
then kiss his foot then deliver up your pigeons and
then look for your reward Ill be at hand sir see
you do it bravely
I warrant you sir let me alone
Sirrah hast thou a knife come let me see it
Here Marcus fold it in the oration
For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant
And when thou hast given it the emperor
Knock at my door and tell me what he says
God be with you sir I will
Come Marcus let us go Publius follow me
Exeunt
Enter SATURNINUS TAMORA DEMETRIUS CHIRON  Lords and others SATURNINUS with the arrows in his hand that TITUS shot
Why lords what wrongs are these was ever seen
An emperor in Rome thus overborne
Troubled confronted thus and for the extent
Of egal justice used in such contempt
My lords you know as know the mightful gods
However these disturbers of our peace
Buz in the peoples ears there nought hath passd
But even with law against the willful sons
Of old Andronicus And what an if
His sorrows have so overwhelmd his wits
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
His fits his frenzy and his bitterness
And now he writes to heaven for his redress
See heres to Jove and this to Mercury
This to Apollo this to the god of war
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome
Whats this but libelling against the senate
And blazoning our injustice every where
A goodly humour is it not my lords
As who would say in Rome no justice were
But if I live his feigned ecstasies
Shall be no shelter to these outrages
But he and his shall know that justice lives
In Saturninus health whom if she sleep
Hell so awake as she in fury shall
Cut off the proudst conspirator that lives
My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine
Lord of my life commander of my thoughts
Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus age
The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarrd his heart
And rather comfort his distressed plight
Than prosecute the meanest or the best
For these contempts
Aside
Why thus it shall become
Highwitted Tamora to gloze with all
But Titus I have touched thee to the quick
Thy lifeblood out if Aaron now be wise
Then is all safe the anchors in the port
Enter Clown
How now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us
Yea forsooth an your mistership be emperial
Empress I am but yonder sits the emperor
Tis he God and Saint Stephen give you good den
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here
SATURNINUS reads the letter
Go take him away and hang him presently
How much money must I have
Come sirrah you must be hanged
Hanged byr lady then I have brought up a neck to
a fair end
Exit guarded
Despiteful and intolerable wrongs
Shall I endure this monstrous villany
I know from whence this same device proceeds
May this be borneas if his traitorous sons
That died by law for murder of our brother
Have by my means been butcherd wrongfully
Go drag the villain hither by the hair
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege
For this proud mock Ill be thy slaughterman
Sly frantic wretch that holpst to make me great
In hope thyself should govern Rome and me
Enter AEMILIUS
What news with thee AEmilius
Arm arm my lordRome never had more cause
The Goths have gatherd head and with a power
highresolved men bent to the spoil
They hither march amain under conduct
Of Lucius son to old Andronicus
Who threats in course of this revenge to do
As much as ever Coriolanus did
Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths
These tidings nip me and I hang the head
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
Ay now begin our sorrows to approach
Tis he the common people love so much
Myself hath often overheard them say
When I have walked like a private man
That Lucius banishment was wrongfully
And they have wishd that Lucius were their emperor
Why should you fear is not your city strong
Ay but the citizens favor Lucius
And will revolt from me to succor him
King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
Is the sun dimmd that gnats do fly in it
The eagle suffers little birds to sing
And is not careful what they mean thereby
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
He can at pleasure stint their melody
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome
Then cheer thy spirit  for know thou emperor
I will enchant the old Andronicus
With words more sweet and yet more dangerous
Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep
When as the one is wounded with the bait
The other rotted with delicious feed
But he will not entreat his son for us
If Tamora entreat him then he will
For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
With golden promises that were his heart
Almost impregnable his old ears deaf
Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue
To AEmilius
Go thou before be our ambassador
Say that the emperor requests a parley
Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting
Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus
AEmilius do this message honourably
And if he stand on hostage for his safety
Bid him demand what pledge will please him best
Your bidding shall I do effectually
Exit
Now will I to that old Andronicus
And temper him with all the art I have
To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths
And now sweet emperor be blithe again
And bury all thy fear in my devices
Then go successantly and plead to him
Exeunt
Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths with drum and colours
Approved warriors and my faithful friends
I have received letters from great Rome
Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
And how desirous of our sight they are
Therefore great lords be as your titles witness
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath
Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus
Whose name was once our terror now our comfort
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt
Be bold in us well follow where thou leadst
Like stinging bees in hottest summers day
Led by their master to the flowered fields
And be avenged on cursed Tamora
And as he saith so say we all with him
I humbly thank him and I thank you all
But who comes here led by a lusty Goth
Enter a Goth leading AARON with his Child in his arms
Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayd
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery
And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
Upon the wasted building suddenly
I heard a child cry underneath a wall
I made unto the noise when soon I heard
The crying babe controlld with this discourse
Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look
Villain thou mightst have been an emperor
But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite
They never do beget a coalblack calf
Peace villain peaceeven thus he rates
the babe
For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth
Who when he knows thou art the empress babe
Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake
With this my weapon drawn I rushd upon him
Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither
To use as you think needful of the man
O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil
That robbd Andronicus of his good hand
This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye
And heres the base fruit of his burning lust
Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey
This growing image of thy fiendlike face
Why dost not speak what deaf not a word
A halter soldiers hang him on this tree
And by his side his fruit of bastardy
Touch not the boy he is of royal blood
Too like the sire for ever being good
First hang the child that he may see it sprawl
A sight to vex the fathers soul withal
Get me a ladder
A ladder brought which AARON is made to ascend
Lucius save the child
And bear it from me to the empress
If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things
That highly may advantage thee to hear
If thou wilt not befall what may befall
Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all
Say on an if it please me which thou speakst
Thy child shall live and I will see it nourishd
An if it please thee why assure thee Lucius
Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak
For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres
Complots of mischief treason villanies
Ruthful to hear yet piteously performd
And this shall all be buried by my death
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live
Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live
Swear that he shall and then I will begin
Who should I swear by thou believest no god
That granted how canst thou believe an oath
What if I do not as indeed I do not
Yet for I know thou art religious
And hast a thing within thee called conscience
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
Which I have seen thee careful to observe
Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know
An idiot holds his bauble for a god
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears
To that Ill urge him therefore thou shalt vow
By that same god what god soeer it be
That thou adorest and hast in reverence
To save my boy to nourish and bring him up
Or else I will discover nought to thee
Even by my god I swear to thee I will
First know thou I begot him on the empress
O most insatiate and luxurious woman
Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon
Twas her two sons that murderd Bassianus
They cut thy sisters tongue and ravishd her
And cut her hands and trimmd her as thou sawst
O detestable villain callst thou that trimming
Why she was washd and cut and trimmd and twas
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it
O barbarous beastly villains like thyself
Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them
That codding spirit had they from their mother
As sure a card as ever won the set
That bloody mind I think they learnd of me
As true a dog as ever fought at head
Well let my deeds be witness of my worth
I traind thy brethren to that guileful hole
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay
I wrote the letter that thy father found
And hid the gold within the letter mentiond
Confederate with the queen and her two sons
And what not done that thou hast cause to rue
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it
I playd the cheater for thy fathers hand
And when I had it drew myself apart
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
I pryd me through the crevice of a wall
When for his hand he had his two sons heads
Beheld his tears and laughd so heartily
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his 
And when I told the empress of this sport
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses
What canst thou say all this and never blush
Ay like a black dog as the saying is
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds
Ay that I had not done a thousand more
Even now I curse the dayand yet I think
Few come within the compass of my curse
Wherein I did not some notorious ill
As kill a man or else devise his death
Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself
Set deadly enmity between two friends
Make poor mens cattle break their necks
Set fire on barns and haystacks in the night
And bid the owners quench them with their tears
Oft have I diggd up dead men from their graves
And set them upright at their dear friends doors
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot
And on their skins as on the bark of trees
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters
Let not your sorrow die though I am dead
Tut I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand more
Bring down the devil for he must not die
So sweet a death as hanging presently
If there be devils would I were a devil
To live and burn in everlasting fire
So I might have your company in hell
But to torment you with my bitter tongue
Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more
Enter a Goth
My lord there is a messenger from Rome
Desires to be admitted to your presence
Let him come near
Enter AEMILIUS
Welcome AEmiliuswhats the news from Rome
Lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths
The Roman emperor greets you all by me
And for he understands you are in arms
He craves a parley at your fathers house
Willing you to demand your hostages
And they shall be immediately deliverd
What says our general
AEmilius let the emperor give his pledges
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus
And we will come March away
Exeunt
Enter TAMORA DEMETRIUS and CHIRON disguised
Thus in this strange and sad habiliment
I will encounter with Andronicus
And say I am Revenge sent from below
To join with him and right his heinous wrongs
Knock at his study where they say he keeps
To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge
Tell him Revenge is come to join with him
And work confusion on his enemies
They knock
Enter TITUS above
Who doth molest my contemplation
Is it your trick to make me ope the door
That so my sad decrees may fly away
And all my study be to no effect
You are deceived for what I mean to do
See here in bloody lines I have set down
And what is written shall be executed
Titus I am come to talk with thee
No not a word how can I grace my talk
Thou hast the odds of me therefore no more
If thou didst know me thou wouldest talk with me
I am not mad I know thee well enough
Witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines
Witness these trenches made by grief and care
Witness the tiring day and heavy night
Witness all sorrow that I know thee well
For our proud empress mighty Tamora
Is not thy coming for my other hand
Know thou sad man I am not Tamora
She is thy enemy and I thy friend
I am Revenge sent from the infernal kingdom
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes
Come down and welcome me to this worlds light
Confer with me of murder and of death
Theres not a hollow cave or lurkingplace
No vast obscurity or misty vale
Where bloody murder or detested rape
Can couch for fear but I will find them out
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name
Revenge which makes the foul offender quake
Art thou Revenge and art thou sent to me
To be a torment to mine enemies
I am therefore come down and welcome me
Do me some service ere I come to thee
Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands
Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge
Stab them or tear them on thy chariotwheels
And then Ill come and be thy waggoner
And whirl along with thee about the globe
Provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away
And find out murderers in their guilty caves
And when thy car is loaden with their heads
I will dismount and by the waggonwheel
Trot like a servile footman all day long
Even from Hyperions rising in the east
Until his very downfall in the sea
And day by day Ill do this heavy task
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there
These are my ministers and come with me
Are these thy ministers what are they calld
Rapine and Murder therefore called so
Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men
Good Lord how like the empress sons they are
And you the empress but we worldly men
Have miserable mad mistaking eyes
O sweet Revenge now do I come to thee
And if one arms embracement will content thee
I will embrace thee in it by and by
Exit above
This closing with him fits his lunacy
Whateer I forge to feed his brainsick fits
Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches
For now he firmly takes me for Revenge
And being credulous in this mad thought
Ill make him send for Lucius his son
And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths
Or at the least make them his enemies
See here he comes and I must ply my theme
Enter TITUS below
Long have I been forlorn and all for thee
Welcome dread Fury to my woful house
Rapine and Murder you are welcome too
How like the empress and her sons you are
Well are you fitted had you but a Moor
Could not all hell afford you such a devil
For well I wot the empress never wags
But in her company there is a Moor
And would you represent our queen aright
It were convenient you had such a devil
But welcome as you are What shall we do
What wouldst thou have us do Andronicus
Show me a murderer Ill deal with him
Show me a villain that hath done a rape
And I am sent to be revenged on him
Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong
And I will be revenged on them all
Look round about the wicked streets of Rome
And when thou findst a man thats like thyself
Good Murder stab him hes a murderer
Go thou with him and when it is thy hap
To find another that is like to thee
Good Rapine stab him hes a ravisher
Go thou with them and in the emperors court
There is a queen attended by a Moor
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion
for up and down she doth resemble thee
I pray thee do on them some violent death
They have been violent to me and mine
Well hast thou lessond us this shall we do
But would it please thee good Andronicus
To send for Lucius thy thricevaliant son
Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths
And bid him come and banquet at thy house
When he is here even at thy solemn feast
I will bring in the empress and her sons
The emperor himself and all thy foes
And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
What says Andronicus to this device
Marcus my brother tis sad Titus calls
Enter MARCUS
Go gentle Marcus to thy nephew Lucius
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths
Bid him repair to me and bring with him
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are
Tell him the emperor and the empress too
Feast at my house and he shall feast with them
This do thou for my love and so let him
As he regards his aged fathers life
This will I do and soon return again
Exit
Now will I hence about thy business
And take my ministers along with me
Nay nay let Rape and Murder stay with me
Or else Ill call my brother back again
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius
Aside to her sons  What say you boys will you
bide with him
Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
How I have governd our determined jest
Yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair
And tarry with him till I turn again
Aside  I know them all though they suppose me mad
And will oerreach them in their own devices
A pair of cursed hellhounds and their dam
Madam depart at pleasure leave us here
Farewell Andronicus Revenge now goes
To lay a complot to betray thy foes
I know thou dost and sweet Revenge farewell
Exit TAMORA
Tell us old man how shall we be employd
Tut I have work enough for you to do
Publius come hither Caius and Valentine
Enter PUBLIUS and others
What is your will

The empress sons I take them Chiron and Demetrius
Fie Publius fie thou art too much deceived
The one is Murder Rape is the others name
And therefore bind them gentle Publius
Caius and Valentine lay hands on them
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour
And now I find it therefore bind them sure
And stop their mouths if they begin to cry
Exit
PUBLIUS  and c lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS
Villains forbear we are the empress sons
And therefore do we what we are commanded
Stop close their mouths let them not speak a word
Is he sure bound look that you bind them fast
Reenter TITUS with LAVINIA he bearing a knife and she a basin
Come come Lavinia look thy foes are bound
Sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me
But let them hear what fearful words I utter
O villains Chiron and Demetrius
Here stands the spring whom you have staind with mud
This goodly summer with your winter mixd
You killd her husband and for that vile fault
Two of her brothers were condemnd to death
My hand cut off and made a merry jest
Both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear
Than hands or tongue her spotless chastity
Inhuman traitors you constraind and forced
What would you say if I should let you speak
Villains for shame you could not beg for grace
Hark wretches how I mean to martyr you
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats
Whilst that Lavinia tween her stumps doth hold
The basin that receives your guilty blood
You know your mother means to feast with me
And calls herself Revenge and thinks me mad
Hark villains I will grind your bones to dust
And with your blood and it Ill make a paste
And of the paste a coffin I will rear
And make two pasties of your shameful heads
And bid that strumpet your unhallowd dam
Like to the earth swallow her own increase
This is the feast that I have bid her to
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter
And worse than Progne I will be revenged
And now prepare your throats Lavinia come
He cuts their throats
Receive the blood and when that they are dead
Let me go grind their bones to powder small
And with this hateful liquor temper it
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked
Come come be every one officious
To make this banquet which I wish may prove
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs feast
So now bring them in for Ill play the cook
And see them ready gainst their mother comes
Exeunt bearing the dead bodies
Enter LUCIUS MARCUS and Goths with AARON prisoner
Uncle Marcus since it is my fathers mind
That I repair to Rome I am content
And ours with thine befall what fortune will
Good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor
This ravenous tiger this accursed devil
Let him receive no sustenance fetter him
Till he be brought unto the empress face
For testimony of her foul proceedings
And see the ambush of our friends be strong
I fear the emperor means no good to us
Some devil whisper curses in mine ear
And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
The venomous malice of my swelling heart
Away inhuman dog unhallowd slave
Sirs help our uncle to convey him in
Exeunt Goths with AARON Flourish within
The trumpets show the emperor is at hand
Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA with AEMILIUS Tribunes Senators and others
What hath the firmament more suns than one
What boots it thee to call thyself a sun
Romes emperor and nephew break the parle
These quarrels must be quietly debated
The feast is ready which the careful Titus
Hath ordaind to an honourable end
For peace for love for league and good to Rome
Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places
Marcus we will
Hautboys sound The Company sit down at table
Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook LAVINIA veiled  Young LUCIUS and others TITUS places the dishes on the table
Welcome my gracious lord welcome dread queen
Welcome ye warlike Goths welcome Lucius
And welcome all although the cheer be poor
Twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it
Why art thou thus attired Andronicus
Because I would be sure to have all well
To entertain your highness and your empress
We are beholding to you good Andronicus
An if your highness knew my heart you were
My lord the emperor resolve me this
Was it well done of rash Virginius
To slay his daughter with his own right hand
Because she was enforced staind and deflowerd
It was Andronicus
Your reason mighty lord
Because the girl should not survive her shame
And by her presence still renew his sorrows
A reason mighty strong and effectual
A pattern precedent and lively warrant
For me most wretched to perform the like
Die die Lavinia and thy shame with thee
Kills LAVINIA
And with thy shame thy fathers sorrow die
What hast thou done unnatural and unkind
Killd her for whom my tears have made me blind
I am as woful as Virginius was
And have a thousand times more cause than he
To do this outrage and it now is done
What was she ravishd tell who did the deed
Willt please you eat willt please your
highness feed
Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus
Not I twas Chiron and Demetrius
They ravishd her and cut away her tongue
And they twas they that did her all this wrong
Go fetch them hither to us presently
Why there they are both baked in that pie
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred
Tis true tis true witness my knifes sharp point
Kills TAMORA
Die frantic wretch for this accursed deed
Kills TITUS
Can the sons eye behold his father bleed
Theres meed for meed death for a deadly deed
Kills SATURNINUS A great tumult LUCIUS MARCUS and others go up into the balcony
You sadfaced men people and sons of Rome
By uproar severd like a flight of fowl
Scatterd by winds and high tempestuous gusts
O let me teach you how to knit again
This scatterd corn  into one mutual sheaf
These broken limbs again into one body
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself
And she whom mighty kingdoms courtsy to
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway
Do shameful execution on herself
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age
Grave witnesses of true experience
Cannot induce you to attend my words
To LUCIUS
Speak Romes dear friend as erst our ancestor
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
To lovesick Didos sad attending ear
The story of that baleful burning night
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priams Troy
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitchd our ears
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief
But floods of tears will drown my oratory
And break my utterance even in the time
When it should move you to attend me most
Lending your kind commiseration
Here is a captain let him tell the tale
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak
Then noble auditory be it known to you
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
Were they that murdered our emperors brother
And they it were that ravished our sister
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded
Our fathers tears despised and basely cozend
Of that true hand that fought Romes quarrel out
And sent her enemies unto the grave
Lastly myself unkindly banished
The gates shut on me and turnd weeping out
To beg relief among Romes enemies
Who drownd their enmity in my true tears
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend
I am the turned forth be it known to you
That have preserved her welfare in my blood
And from her bosom took the enemys point
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body
Alas you know I am no vaunter I
My scars can witness dumb although they are
That my report is just and full of truth
But soft methinks I do digress too much
Citing my worthless praise O pardon me
For when no friends are by men praise themselves
Now is my turn to speak Behold this child
Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant
Of this was Tamora delivered
The issue of an irreligious Moor
Chief architect and plotter of these woes
The villain is alive in Titus house
And as he is to witness this is true
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
These wrongs unspeakable past patience
Or more than any living man could bear
Now you have heard the truth what say you Romans
Have we done aught amissshow us wherein
And from the place where you behold us now
The poor remainder of Andronici
Will hand in hand all headlong cast us down
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains
And make a mutual closure of our house
Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall
Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall
Come come thou reverend man of Rome
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand
Lucius our emperor for well I know
The common voice do cry it shall be so
Lucius all hail Romes royal emperor
Go go into old Titus sorrowful house
To Attendants
And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death
As punishment for his most wicked life
Exeunt Attendants
LUCIUS MARCUS and the others descend
Lucius all hail Romes gracious governor
Thanks gentle Romans may I govern so
To heal Romes harms and wipe away her woe
But gentle people give me aim awhile
For nature puts me to a heavy task
Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk
O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips
Kissing TITUS
These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstaind face
The last true duties of thy noble son
Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips
O were the sum of these that I should pay
Countless and infinite yet would I pay them
Come hither boy come come and learn of us
To melt in showers thy grandsire loved thee well
Many a time he danced thee on his knee
Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow
Many a matter hath he told to thee
Meet and agreeing with thine infancy
In that respect then like a loving child
Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring
Because kind nature doth require it so
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe
Bid him farewell commit him to the grave
Do him that kindness and take leave of him
O grandsire grandsire even with all my heart
Would I were dead so you did live again
O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping
My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth
Reenter Attendants with AARON
You sad Andronici have done with woes
Give sentence on this execrable wretch
That hath been breeder of these dire events
Set him breastdeep in earth and famish him
There let him stand and rave and cry for food
If any one relieves or pities him
For the offence he dies This is our doom
Some stay to see him fastend in the earth
O why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
I am no baby I that with base prayers
I should repent the evils I have done
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Would I perform if I might have my will
If one good deed in all my life I did
I do repent it from my very soul
Some loving friends convey the emperor hence
And give him burial in his fathers grave
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Be closed in our households monument
As for that heinous tiger Tamora
No funeral rite nor man m mourning weeds
No mournful bell shall ring her burial
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey
Her life was beastlike and devoid of pity
And being so shall have like want of pity
See justice done on Aaron that damnd Moor
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning
Then afterwards to order well the state
That like events may neer it ruinate
Exeunt
PROLOGUE
The princes orgulous their high blood chafed
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships
Fraught with the ministers and instruments
Of cruel war sixty and nine that wore
Their crownets regal from the Athenian bay
Put forth toward Phrygia and their vow is made
To ransack Troy within whose strong immures
The ravishd Helen Menelaus queen
With wanton Paris sleeps and thats the quarrel
To Tenedos they come
And the deepdrawing barks do there disgorge
Their warlike fraughtage now on Dardan plains
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
Their brave pavilions Priams sixgated city
Dardan and Tymbria Helias Chetas Troien
And Antenorides with massy staples
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
Sperr up the sons of Troy
Now expectation tickling skittish spirits
On one and other side Trojan and Greek
Sets all on hazard and hither am I come
A prologue armd but not in confidence
In like conditions as our argument
To tell you fair beholders that our play
Leaps oer the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
Beginning in the middle starting thence away
To what may be digested in a play
Like or find fault do as your pleasures are
Now good or bad tis but the chance of war
Enter TROILUS armed and PANDARUS
Call here my varlet Ill unarm again
Why should I war without the walls of Troy
That find such cruel battle here within
Each Trojan that is master of his heart
Let him to field Troilus alas hath none
Will this gear neer be mended
The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
But I am weaker than a womans tear
Tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
Less valiant than the virgin in the night
Well I have told you enough of this for my part
Ill not meddle nor make no further He that will
have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding
Have I not tarried
Ay the grinding but you must tarry
the bolting
Have I not tarried
Ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening
Still have I tarried
Ay to the leavening but heres yet in the word
hereafter the kneading the making of the cake the
heating of the oven and the baking nay you must
stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lips
Patience herself what goddess eer she be
Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do
At Priams royal table do I sit
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts
So traitor When she comes When is she thence
Well she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
her look or any woman else
I was about to tell theewhen my heart
As wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me
I have as when the sun doth light a storm
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
But sorrow that is couchd in seeming gladness
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helens
well go tothere were no more comparison between
the women but for my part she is my kinswoman I
would not as they term it praise her but I would
somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did I
will not dispraise your sister Cassandras wit but
O Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus
When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drownd
Reply not in how many fathoms deep
They lie indrenchd I tell thee I am mad
In Cressids love thou answerst she is fair
Pourst in the open ulcer of my heart
Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
Handlest in thy discourse O that her hand
In whose comparison all whites are ink
Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
The cygnets down is harsh and spirit of sense
Hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tellst me
As true thou tellst me when I say I love her
But saying thus instead of oil and balm
Thou layst in every gash that love hath given me
The knife that made it
I speak no more than truth
Thou dost not speak so much
Faith Ill not meddle int Let her be as she is
if she be fair tis the better for her an she be
not she has the mends in her own hands
Good Pandarus how now Pandarus
I have had my labour for my travail illthought on of
her and illthought on of you gone between and
between but small thanks for my labour
What art thou angry Pandarus what with me
Because shes kin to me therefore shes not so fair
as Helen an she were not kin to me she would be as
fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday But what care
I I care not an she were a blackamoor tis all one to me
Say I she is not fair
I do not care whether you do or no Shes a fool to
stay behind her father let her to the Greeks and so
Ill tell her the next time I see her for my part
Ill meddle nor make no more i the matter
Pandarus
Not I
Sweet Pandarus
Pray you speak no more to me I will leave all as I
found it and there an end
Exit PANDARUS An alarum
Peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds
Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair
When with your blood you daily paint her thus
I cannot fight upon this argument
It is too starved a subject for my sword
But PandarusO gods how do you plague me
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar
And hes as tetchy to be wood to woo
As she is stubbornchaste against all suit
Tell me Apollo for thy Daphnes love
What Cressid is what Pandar and what we
Her bed is India there she lies a pearl
Between our Ilium and where she resides
Let it be calld the wild and wandering flood
Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar
Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
Alarum Enter AENEAS
How now Prince Troilus wherefore not afield
Because not there this womans answer sorts
For womanish it is to be from thence
What news AEneas from the field today
That Paris is returned home and hurt
By whom AEneas
Troilus by Menelaus
Let Paris bleed tis but a scar to scorn
Paris is gored with Menelaus horn
Alarum
Hark what good sport is out of town today
Better at home if would I might were may
But to the sport abroad are you bound thither
In all swift haste
Come go we then together
Exeunt
Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER
Who were those went by
Queen Hecuba and Helen
And whither go they
Up to the eastern tower
Whose height commands as subject all the vale
To see the battle Hector whose patience
Is as a virtue fixd today was moved
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer
And like as there were husbandry in war
Before the sun rose he was harnessd light
And to the field goes he where every flower
Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
In Hectors wrath
What was his cause of anger
The noise goes this there is among the Greeks
A lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hector
They call him Ajax
Good and what of him
They say he is a very man per se
And stands alone
So do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs
This man lady hath robbed many beasts of their
particular additions he is as valiant as the lion
churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with
discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he
hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he
carries some stain of it he is melancholy without
cause and merry against the hair he hath the
joints of every thing but everything so out of joint
that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use
or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight
But how should this man that makes
me smile make Hector angry
They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath
ever since kept Hector fasting and waking
Who comes here
Madam your uncle Pandarus
Enter PANDARUS
Hectors a gallant man
As may be in the world lady
Whats that whats that
Good morrow uncle Pandarus
Good morrow cousin Cressid what do you talk of
Good morrow Alexander How do you cousin When
were you at Ilium
This morning uncle
What were you talking of when I came Was Hector
armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium Helen was not
up was she
Hector was gone but Helen was not up
Even so Hector was stirring early
That were we talking of and of his anger
Was he angry
So he says here
True he was so I know the cause too hell lay
about him today I can tell them that and theres
Troilus will not come far behind him let them take
heed of Troilus I can tell them that too
What is he angry too
Who Troilus Troilus is the better man of the two
O Jupiter theres no comparison
What not between Troilus and Hector Do you know a
man if you see him
Ay if I ever saw him before and knew him
Well I say Troilus is Troilus
Then you say as I say for I am sure he is not Hector
No nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees
Tis just to each of them he is himself
Himself Alas poor Troilus I would he were
So he is
Condition I had gone barefoot to India
He is not Hector
Himself no hes not himself would a were
himself Well the gods are above time must friend
or end well Troilus well I would my heart were
in her body No Hector is not a better man than Troilus
Excuse me
He is elder
Pardon me pardon me
Th others not come tot you shall tell me another
tale when th others come tot Hector shall not
have his wit this year
He shall not need it if he have his own
Nor his qualities
No matter
Nor his beauty
Twould not become him his owns better
You have no judgment niece Helen
herself swore th other day that Troilus for
a brown favourfor so tis I must confess
not brown neither
No but brown
Faith to say truth brown and not brown
To say the truth true and not true
She praised his complexion above Paris
Why Paris hath colour enough
So he has
Then Troilus should have too much if she praised
him above his complexion is higher than his he
having colour enough and the other higher is too
flaming a praise for a good complexion I had as
lief Helens golden tongue had commended Troilus for
a copper nose
I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris
Then shes a merry Greek indeed
Nay I am sure she does She came to him th other
day into the compassed windowand you know he
has not past three or four hairs on his chin
Indeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his
particulars therein to a total
Why he is very young and yet will he within
three pound lift as much as his brother Hector
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter
But to prove to you that Helen loves him she came
and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin
Juno have mercy how came it cloven
Why you know tis dimpled I think his smiling
becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia
O he smiles valiantly
Does he not
O yes an twere a cloud in autumn
Why go to then but to prove to you that Helen
loves Troilus
Troilus will stand to the proof if youll
prove it so
Troilus why he esteems her no more than I esteem
an addle egg
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
head you would eat chickens i the shell
I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled
his chin indeed she has a marvellous white hand I
must needs confess
Without the rack
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin
Alas poor chin many a wart is richer
But there was such laughing Queen Hecuba laughed
that her eyes ran oer
With millstones
And Cassandra laughed
But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
her eyes did her eyes run oer too
And Hector laughed
At what was all this laughing
Marry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus chin
Ant had been a green hair I should have laughed
too
They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer
What was his answer
Quoth she Heres but two and fifty hairs on your
chin and one of them is white
This is her question
Thats true make no question of that Two and
fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white
hair is my father and all the rest are his sons
Jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is Paris
my husband The forked one quoth he pluckt
out and give it him But there was such laughing
and Helen so blushed an Paris so chafed and all the
rest so laughed that it passed
So let it now for it has been while going by
Well cousin I told you a thing yesterday think ont
So I do
Ill be sworn tis true he will weep you an twere
a man born in April
And Ill spring up in his tears an twere a nettle
against May
A retreat sounded

Paris is dirt to him and I warrant Helen to

Here come more
Forces pass
Asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran
porridge after meat I could live and die i the
eyes of Troilus Neer look neer look the eagles

rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and

There is among the Greeks Achilles a better man than Troilus
Achilles a drayman a porter a very camel
Well well
Well well why have you any discretion have
you any eyes Do you know what a man is Is not
birth beauty good shape discourse manhood
learning gentleness virtue youth liberality
and such like the spice and salt that season a man
Ay a minced man and then to be baked with no date
in the pie for then the mans dates out
You are such a woman one knows not at what ward you
lie
Upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to
defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine
honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to
defend all these and at all these wards I lie at a
thousand watches
Say one of your watches
Nay Ill watch you for that and thats one of the
chiefest of them too if I cannot ward what I would
not have hit I can watch you for telling how I took
the blow unless it swell past hiding and then its
past watching
You are such another
Enter Troiluss Boy
Sir my lord would instantly speak with you
Where
At your own house there he unarms him
Good boy tell him I come
Exit boy
I doubt he be hurt Fare ye well good niece
Adieu uncle
Ill be with you niece by and by
To bring uncle
Ay a token from Troilus
By the same token you are a bawd
Exit PANDARUS
Words vows gifts tears and loves full sacrifice
He offers in anothers enterprise
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
Than in the glass of Pandars praise may be
Yet hold I off Women are angels wooing
Things won are done joys soul lies in the doing
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this
Men prize the thing ungaind more than it is
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach
Achievement is command ungaind beseech
Then though my hearts content firm love doth bear
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear
Exeunt
Sennet Enter AGAMEMNON NESTOR ULYSSES MENELAUS and others
Princes
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
Fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters
As knots by the conflux of meeting sap
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth
Nor princes is it matter new to us
That we come short of our suppose so far
That after seven years siege yet Troy walls stand
Whereof we have record trial did draw
Bias and thwart not answering the aim
And that unbodied figure of the thought
That gavet surmised shape Why then you princes
Do you with cheeks abashd behold our works
And call them shames which are indeed nought else
To find persistive constancy in men
The fineness of which metal is not found
In fortunes love for then the bold and coward
The wise and fool the artist and unread
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin
But in the wind and tempest of her frown
Distinction with a broad and powerful fan
Puffing at all winnows the light away
And what hath mass or matter by itself
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled
With due observance of thy godlike seat
Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply
Thy latest words In the reproof of chance
Lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
Upon her patient breast making their way
With those of nobler bulk
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
The gentle Thetis and anon behold
The strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut
Bounding between the two moist elements
Like Perseus horse wheres then the saucy boat
Whose weak untimberd sides but even now
Corivalld greatness Either to harbour fled
Or made a toast for Neptune Even so
Doth valours show and valours worth divide
In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
And flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
Retorts to chiding fortune
Agamemnon
Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece
Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Should be shut up hear what Ulysses speaks
Besides the applause and approbation To which
To AGAMEMNON
most mighty for thy place and sway
To NESTOR
And thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life
I give to both your speeches which were such
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
Should hold up high in brass and such again
As venerable Nestor hatchd in silver
Should with a bond of air strong as the axletree
On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears
To his experienced tongue yet let it please both
Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak
Speak prince of Ithaca and bet of less expect
That matter needless of importless burden
Divide thy lips than we are confident
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws
We shall hear music wit and oracle
Troy yet upon his basis had been down
And the great Hectors sword had lackd a master
But for these instances
The specialty of rule hath been neglected
And look how many Grecian tents do stand
When that the general is not like the hive
To whom the foragers shall all repair
What honey is expected Degree being vizarded
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask
The heavens themselves the planets and this centre
Observe degree priority and place
Insisture course proportion season form
Office and custom in all line of order
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
Amidst the other whose medicinable eye
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
And posts like the commandment of a king
Sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets
In evil mixture to disorder wander
What plagues and what portents what mutiny
What raging of the sea shaking of earth
Commotion in the winds frights changes horrors
Divert and crack rend and deracinate
The unity and married calm of states
Quite from their fixure O when degree is shaked
Which is the ladder to all high designs
Then enterprise is sick How could communities
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores
The primogenitive and due of birth
Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
But by degree stand in authentic place
Take but degree away untune that string
And hark what discord follows each thing meets
In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
And make a sop of all this solid globe
Strength should be lord of imbecility
And the rude son should strike his father dead
Force should be right or rather right and wrong
Between whose endless jar justice resides
Should lose their names and so should justice too
Then every thing includes itself in power
Power into will will into appetite
And appetite an universal wolf
So doubly seconded with will and power
Must make perforce an universal prey
And last eat up himself Great Agamemnon
This chaos when degree is suffocate
Follows the choking
And this neglection of degree it is
That by a pace goes backward with a purpose
It hath to climb The generals disdaind
By him one step below he by the next
That next by him beneath so every step
Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Of his superior grows to an envious fever
Of pale and bloodless emulation
And tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot
Not her own sinews To end a tale of length
Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength
Most wisely hath Ulysses here discoverd
The fever whereof all our power is sick
The nature of the sickness found Ulysses
What is the remedy
The great Achilles whom opinion crowns
The sinew and the forehand of our host
Having his ear full of his airy fame
Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Breaks scurril jests
Which slanderer he imitation calls
He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon
Thy topless deputation he puts on
And like a strutting player whose conceit
Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage
Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming
Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquared
Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd
Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff
The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
Cries Excellent tis Agamemnon just
Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard
As he being drest to some oration
Thats done as near as the extremest ends
Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife
Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent
Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus
Arming to answer in a night alarm
And then forsooth the faint defects of age
And with a palsyfumbling on his gorget
Shake in and out the rivet and at this sport
Sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus
Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all
In pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion
All our abilities gifts natures shapes
Achievements plots orders preventions
Excitements to the field or speech for truce
Success or loss what is or is not serves
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes
And in the imitation of these twain
Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns
With an imperial voicemany are infect
Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head
In such a rein in full as proud a place
As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him
Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
To match us in comparisons with dirt
To weaken and discredit our exposure
How rank soever rounded in with danger
They tax our policy and call it cowardice
Count wisdom as no member of the war
But that of hand the still and mental parts
That do contrive how many hands shall strike
When fitness calls them on and know by measure
Of their observant toil the enemies weight
Why this hath not a fingers dignity
They call this bedwork mappery closetwar
So that the ram that batters down the wall
For the great swing and rudeness of his poise
They place before his hand that made the engine
Or those that with the fineness of their souls
By reason guide his execution
Let this be granted and Achilles horse
Makes many Thetis sons
A tucket
What trumpet look Menelaus
From Troy
Enter AENEAS
What would you fore our tent
Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you
Even this
May one that is a herald and a prince
Do a fair message to his kingly ears
With surety stronger than Achilles arm
Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice
Call Agamemnon head and general
Fair leave and large security How may
A stranger to those most imperial looks
Know them from eyes of other mortals
How
Ay
I ask that I might waken reverence
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
The youthful Phoebus
Which is that god in office guiding men
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon
This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers
Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd
As bending angels thats their fame in peace
But when they would seem soldiers they have galls
Good arms strong joints true swords and
Joves accord
Nothing so full of heart But peace AEneas
Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips
The worthiness of praise distains his worth
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth
But what the repining enemy commends
That breath fame blows that praise sole sure
transcends
Sir you of Troy call you yourself AEneas
Ay Greek that is my name
Whats your affair I pray you
Sir pardon tis for Agamemnons ears
He hears naught privately that comes from Troy
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear
To set his sense on the attentive bent
And then to speak
Speak frankly as the wind
It is not Agamemnons sleeping hour
That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake
He tells thee so himself
Trumpet blow loud
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
And every Greek of mettle let him know
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
Trumpet sounds
We have great Agamemnon here in Troy
A prince calld HectorPriam is his father
Who in this dull and longcontinued truce
Is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet
And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords
If there be one among the fairst of Greece
That holds his honour higher than his ease
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
That knows his valour and knows not his fear
That loves his mistress more than in confession
With truant vows to her own lips he loves
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
In other arms than hersto him this challenge
Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks
Shall make it good or do his best to do it
He hath a lady wiser fairer truer
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms
And will tomorrow with his trumpet call
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love
If any come Hector shall honour him
If none hell say in Troy when he retires
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
The splinter of a lance Even so much
This shall be told our lovers Lord AEneas
If none of them have soul in such a kind
We left them all at home but we are soldiers
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove
That means not hath not or is not in love
If then one is or hath or means to be
That one meets Hector if none else I am he
Tell him of Nestor one that was a man
When Hectors grandsire suckd he is old now
But if there be not in our Grecian host
One noble man that hath one spark of fire
To answer for his love tell him from me
Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
And in my vantbrace put this witherd brawn
And meeting him will tell him that my lady
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
As may be in the world his youth in flood
Ill prove this truth with my three drops of blood
Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth
Amen
Fair Lord AEneas let me touch your hand
To our pavilion shall I lead you sir
Achilles shall have word of this intent
So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent
Yourself shall feast with us before you go
And find the welcome of a noble foe
Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR
Nestor
What says Ulysses
I have a young conception in my brain
Be you my time to bring it to some shape
What ist
This tis
Blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride
That hath to this maturity blown up
In rank Achilles must or now be croppd
Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
To overbulk us all
Well and how
This challenge that the gallant Hector sends
However it is spread in general name
Relates in purpose only to Achilles
The purpose is perspicuous even as substance
And in the publication make no strain
But that Achilles were his brain as barren
As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows
Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment
Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose
Pointing on him
And wake him to the answer think you
Yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose
That can from Hector bring his honour off
If not Achilles Thought be a sportful combat
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells
For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute
With their finest palate and trust to me Ulysses
Our imputation shall be oddly poised
Although particular shall give a scantling
Of good or bad unto the general
And in such indexes although small pricks
To their subsequent volumes there is seen
The baby figure of the giant mass
Of things to come at large It is supposed
He that meets Hector issues from our choice
Makes merit her election and doth boil
As twere from us all a man distilld
Out of our virtues who miscarrying
What heart receives from hence the conquering part
To steel a strong opinion to themselves
Which entertaind limbs are his instruments
In no less working than are swords and bows
Directive by the limbs
Give pardon to my speech
Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector
Let us like merchants show our foulest wares
And think perchance theyll sell if not
The lustre of the better yet to show
Shall show the better Do not consent
That ever Hector and Achilles meet
For both our honour and our shame in this
Are doggd with two strange followers
I see them not with my old eyes what are they
What glory our Achilles shares from Hector
Were he not proud we all should share with him
But he already is too insolent
A nd we were better parch in Afric sun
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
Should he scape Hector fair if he were foild
Why then we did our main opinion crush
In taint of our best man No make a lottery
And by device let blockish Ajax draw
The sort to fight with Hector among ourselves
Give him allowance for the better man
For that will physic the great Myrmidon
Who broils in loud applause and make him fall
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off
Well dress him up in voices if he fail
Yet go we under our opinion still
That we have better men But hit or miss
Our projects life this shape of sense assumes
Ajax employd plucks down Achilles plumes
Ulysses
Now I begin to relish thy advice
And I will give a taste of it forthwith
To Agamemnon go we to him straight
Two curs shall tame each other pride alone
Must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone
Exeunt
Enter AJAX and THERSITES
Thersites
Agamemnon how if he had boils full all over
generally
Thersites
And those boils did run say so did not the
general run then were not that a botchy core
Dog
Then would come some matter from him I see none now
Thou bitchwolfs son canst thou not hear
Beating him
Feel then
The plague of Greece upon thee thou mongrel
beefwitted lord
Speak then thou vinewedst leaven speak I will
beat thee into handsomeness
I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but
I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than
thou learn a prayer without book Thou canst strike
canst thou a red murrain o thy jades tricks
Toadstool learn me the proclamation
Dost thou think I have no sense thou strikest me thus
The proclamation
Thou art proclaimed a fool I think
Do not porpentine do not my fingers itch
I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
the scratching of thee I would make thee the
loathsomest scab in Greece When thou art forth in
the incursions thou strikest as slow as another
I say the proclamation
Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles
and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
Cerberus is at Proserpines beauty ay that thou
barkest at him
Mistress Thersites
Thou shouldest strike him
Cobloaf
He would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a
sailor breaks a biscuit
Beating him  You whoreson cur
Do do
Thou stool for a witch
Ay do do thou soddenwitted lord thou hast no
more brain than I have in mine elbows an assinego
may tutor thee thou scurvyvaliant ass thou art
here but to thrash Trojans and thou art bought and
sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave
If thou use to beat me I will begin at thy heel and
tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no
bowels thou
You dog
You scurvy lord
Beating him  You cur
Mars his idiot do rudeness do camel do do
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Why how now Ajax wherefore do you thus How now
Thersites whats the matter man
You see him there do you
Ay whats the matter
Nay look upon him
So I do whats the matter
Nay but regard him well
Well why I do so
But yet you look not well upon him for whosoever you
take him to be he is Ajax
I know that fool
Ay but that fool knows not himself
Therefore I beat thee
Lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his
evasions have ears thus long I have bobbed his
brain more than he has beat my bones I will buy
nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not
worth the nineth part of a sparrow This lord
Achilles Ajax who wears his wit in his belly and
his guts in his head Ill tell you what I say of
him
What
I say this Ajax
Ajax offers to beat him
Nay good Ajax
Has not so much wit
Nay I must hold you
As will stop the eye of Helens needle for whom he
comes to fight
Peace fool
I would have peace and quietness but the fool will
not he there that he look you there
O thou damned cur I shall
Will you set your wit to a fools
No I warrant you for a fools will shame it
Good words Thersites
Whats the quarrel
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
proclamation and he rails upon me
I serve thee not
Well go to go to
I serve here voluntarily
Your last service was sufferance twas not
voluntary no man is beaten voluntary Ajax was
here the voluntary and you as under an impress
Een so a great deal of your wit too lies in your
sinews or else there be liars Hector have a great
catch if he knock out either of your brains a
were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel
What with me too Thersites
Theres Ulysses and old Nestor whose wit was mouldy
ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you
like draughtoxen and make you plough up the wars
What what
Yes good sooth to Achilles to Ajax to
I shall cut out your tongue
Tis no matter I shall speak as much as thou
afterwards
No more words Thersites peace
I will hold my peace when Achilles brach bids me shall I
Theres for you Patroclus
I will see you hanged like clotpoles ere I come
any more to your tents I will keep where there is
Exit
A good riddance
Marry this sir is proclaimd through all our host
That Hector by the fifth hour of the sun
Will with a trumpet twixt our tents and Troy
Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms
That hath a stomach and such a one that dare
MaintainI know not what tis trash Farewell
Farewell Who shall answer him
I know not tis put to lottery otherwise
He knew his man
O meaning you I will go learn more of it
Exeunt
Enter PRIAM HECTOR TROILUS PARIS and HELENUS
After so many hours lives speeches spent
Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks
Deliver Helen and all damage else
As honour loss of time travail expense
Wounds friends and what else dear that is consumed
In hot digestion of this cormorant war
Shall be struck off Hector what say you tot
Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
As far as toucheth my particular
Yet dread Priam
There is no lady of more softer bowels
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear
More ready to cry out Who knows what follows
Than Hector is the wound of peace is surety
Surety secure but modest doubt is calld
The beacon of the wise the tent that searches
To the bottom of the worst Let Helen go
Since the first sword was drawn about this question
Every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes
Hath been as dear as Helen I mean of ours
If we have lost so many tenths of ours
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
Had it our name the value of one ten
What merits in that reason which denies
The yielding of her up
Fie fie my brother
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
So great as our dread father in a scale
Of common ounces will you with counters sum
The past proportion of his infinite
And buckle in a waist most fathomless
With spans and inches so diminutive
As fears and reasons fie for godly shame
No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
You are so empty of them Should not our father
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
Because your speech hath none that tells him so
You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
You fur your gloves with reason Here are
your reasons
You know an enemy intends you harm
You know a sword employd is perilous
And reason flies the object of all harm
Who marvels then when Helenus beholds
A Grecian and his sword if he do set
The very wings of reason to his heels
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove
Or like a star disorbd Nay if we talk of reason
Lets shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour
Should have harehearts would they but fat
their thoughts
With this crammd reason reason and respect
Make livers pale and lustihood deject
Brother she is not worth what she doth cost
The holding
What is aught but as tis valued
But value dwells not in particular will
It holds his estimate and dignity
As well wherein tis precious of itself
As in the prizer tis mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the god
And the will dotes that is attributive
To what infectiously itself affects
Without some image of the affected merit
I take today a wife and my election
Is led on in the conduct of my will
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
Two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores
Of will and judgment how may I avoid
Although my will distaste what it elected
The wife I chose there can be no evasion
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
When we have soild them nor the remainder viands
We do not throw in unrespective sieve
Because we now are full It was thought meet
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails
The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
And did him service he touchd the ports desired
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive
He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness
Wrinkles Apollos and makes stale the morning
Why keep we her the Grecians keep our aunt
Is she worth keeping why she is a pearl
Whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships
And turnd crownd kings to merchants
If youll avouch twas wisdom Paris went
As you must needs for you all cried Go go
If youll confess he brought home noble prize
As you must needs for you all clappd your hands
And cried Inestimablewhy do you now
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate
And do a deed that fortune never did
Beggar the estimation which you prized
Richer than sea and land O theft most base
That we have stoln what we do fear to keep
But thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln
That in their country did them that disgrace
We fear to warrant in our native place
Within  Cry Trojans cry
What noise what shriek is this
Tis our mad sister I do know her voice
Within  Cry Trojans
It is Cassandra
Enter CASSANDRA raving
Cry Trojans cry lend me ten thousand eyes
And I will fill them with prophetic tears
Peace sister peace
Virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld
Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
Add to my clamours let us pay betimes
A moiety of that mass of moan to come
Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand
Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all
Cry Trojans cry a Helen and a woe
Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go
Exit
Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains
Of divination in our sister work
Some touches of remorse or is your blood
So madly hot that no discourse of reason
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
Can qualify the same
Why brother Hector
Such and no other than event doth form it
Nor once deject the courage of our minds
Because Cassandras mad her brainsick raptures
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
Which hath our several honours all engaged
To make it gracious For my private part
I am no more touchd than all Priams sons
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
To fight for and maintain
Else might the world convince of levity
As well my undertakings as your counsels
But I attest the gods your full consent
Gave wings to my propension and cut off
All fears attending on so dire a project
For what alas can these my single arms
What Propugnation is in one mans valour
To stand the push and enmity of those
This quarrel would excite Yet I protest
Were I alone to pass the difficulties
And had as ample power as I have will
Nor faint in the pursuit
Paris you speak
Like one besotted on your sweet delights
You have the honey still but these the gall
So to be valiant is no praise at all
Sir I propose not merely to myself
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it
But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Wiped off in honourable keeping her
What treason were it to the ransackd queen
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
Now to deliver her possession up
On terms of base compulsion Can it be
That so degenerate a strain as this
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms
Theres not the meanest spirit on our party
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
When Helen is defended nor none so noble
Whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamed
Where Helen is the subject then I say
Well may we fight for her whom we know well
The worlds large spaces cannot parallel
Paris and Troilus you have both said well
And on the cause and question now in hand
Have glozed but superficially not much
Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought
Unfit to hear moral philosophy
The reasons you allege do more conduce
To the hot passion of distemperd blood
Than to make up a free determination
Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Of any true decision Nature craves
All dues be renderd to their owners now
What nearer debt in all humanity
Than wife is to the husband If this law
Of nature be corrupted through affection
And that great minds of partial indulgence
To their benumbed wills resist the same
There is a law in each wellorderd nation
To curb those raging appetites that are
If Helen then be wife to Spartas king
As it is known she is these moral laws
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
To have her back returnd thus to persist
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong
But makes it much more heavy Hectors opinion
Is this in way of truth yet neertheless
My spritely brethren I propend to you
In resolution to keep Helen still
For tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
Upon our joint and several dignities
Why there you touchd the life of our design
Were it not glory that we more affected
Than the performance of our heaving spleens
I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector
She is a theme of honour and renown
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
Whose present courage may beat down our foes
And fame in time to come canonize us
For I presume brave Hector would not lose
So rich advantage of a promised glory
For the wide worlds revenue
I am yours
You valiant offspring of great Priamus
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
I was advertised their great general slept
Whilst emulation in the army crept
This I presume will wake him
Exeunt
Enter THERSITES solus
How now Thersites what lost in the labyrinth of
thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He

whilst he railed at me Sfoot Ill learn to
conjure and raise devils but Ill see some issue of
my spiteful execrations Then theres Achilles a
rare enginer If Troy be not taken till these two
undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of
themselves O thou great thunderdarter of Olympus
forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and
Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy
caduceus if ye take not that little little less
than little wit from them that they have which
shortarmed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
from a spider without drawing their massy irons and
cutting the web After this the vengeance on the
whole camp or rather the boneache for that
methinks is the curse dependent on those that war
for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy
say Amen What ho my Lord Achilles
Enter PATROCLUS
Whos there Thersites Good Thersites come in and rail
If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou
wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but
it is no matter thyself upon thyself The common
curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in
great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and
discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy
direction till thy death then if she that lays thee
out says thou art a fair corse Ill be sworn and
sworn upont she never shrouded any but lazars
Amen Wheres Achilles

Ay the heavens hear me
Enter ACHILLES

Thy knower Patroclus then tell me Patroclus
what art thou
Thou mayst tell that knowest
O tell tell
Ill decline the whole question Agamemnon commands
Achilles Achilles is my lord I am Patroclus
knower and Patroclus is a fool
You rascal
Peace fool I have not done
He is a privileged man Proceed Thersites
Agamemnon is a fool Achilles is a fool Thersites
is a fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a fool
Derive this come
Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon
Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and
Patroclus is a fool positive
Why am I a fool
Make that demand of the prover It suffices me thou

Patroclus Ill speak with nobody

Enter AGAMEMNON ULYSSES NESTOR DIOMEDES and AJAX
Where is Achilles
Within his tent but ill disposed my lord
Let it be known to him that we are here
He shent our messengers and we lay by
Our appertainments visiting of him
Let him be told so lest perchance he think
We dare not move the question of our place
Or know not what we are
I shall say so to him
Exit
We saw him at the opening of his tent
He is not sick
Yes lionsick sick of proud heart you may call it
melancholy if you will favour the man but by my
head tis pride but why why let him show us the
cause A word my lord
Takes AGAMEMNON aside
What moves Ajax thus to bay at him
Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him
Who Thersites
He
Then will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument
No you see he is his argument that has his
argument Achilles
could disunite
The amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily
untie Here comes Patroclus
Reenter PATROCLUS
No Achilles with him
The elephant hath joints but none for courtesy
his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
Achilles bids me say he is much sorry
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
Did move your greatness and this noble state
To call upon him he hopes it is no other
But for your health and your digestion sake
And afterdinners breath
Hear you Patroclus
We are too well acquainted with these answers
But his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn
Cannot outfly our apprehensions
Much attribute he hath and much the reason
Why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues
Not virtuously on his own part beheld
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him
We come to speak with him and you shall not sin
If you do say we think him overproud
And underhonest in selfassumption greater
Than in the note of judgment and worthier
than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
Disguise the holy strength of their command
And underwrite in an observing kind
His humorous predominance yea watch
His pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
Rode on his tide Go tell him this and add
That if he overhold his price so much
Well none of him but let him like an engine
Not portable lie under this report
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant Tell him so
I shall and bring his answer presently
Exit
In second voice well not be satisfied
We come to speak with him Ulysses enter you
Exit ULYSSES
What is he more than another
No more than what he thinks he is
Is he so much Do you not think he thinks himself a
better man than I am
No question
Will you subscribe his thought and say he is
No noble Ajax you are as strong as valiant as
wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether
Why should a man be proud How doth pride grow I
know not what pride is
Your mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the
fairer He that is proud eats up himself pride is
his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle
and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours
the deed in the praise
I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering of toads
Yet he loves himself ist not strange
Aside
Reenter ULYSSES
Achilles will not to the field tomorrow
Whats his excuse
He doth rely on none
But carries on the stream of his dispose
Without observance or respect of any
In will peculiar and in selfadmission
Why will he not upon our fair request
Untent his person and share the air with us
Things small as nothing for requests sake only
He makes important possessd he is with greatness
And speaks not to himself but with a pride
That quarrels at selfbreath imagined worth
Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
Kingdomd Achilles in commotion rages
And batters down himself what should I say
He is so plaguy proud that the deathtokens of it
Cry No recovery
Let Ajax go to him
Dear lord go you and greet him in his tent
Tis said he holds you well and will be led
At your request a little from himself
O Agamemnon let it not be so
Well consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
When they go from Achilles shall the proud lord
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
And never suffers matter of the world
Enter his thoughts save such as do revolve
And ruminate himself shall he be worshippd
Of that we hold an idol more than he
No this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
Must not so stale his palm nobly acquired
Nor by my will assubjugate his merit
As amply titled as Achilles is
By going to Achilles
That were to enlard his fat already pride
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
With entertaining great Hyperion
This lord go to him Jupiter forbid
And say in thunder Achilles go to him
Aside to DIOMEDES  O this is well he rubs the
vein of him
Aside to NESTOR  And how his silence drinks up
this applause
If I go to him with my armed fist Ill pash him oer the face
O no you shall not go
An a be proud with me Ill pheeze his pride
Let me go to him
Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel
A paltry insolent fellow
How he describes himself
Can he not be sociable
The raven chides blackness
Ill let his humours blood
He will be the physician that should be the patient
An all men were o my mind
Wit would be out of fashion
A should not bear it so a should eat swords first
shall pride carry it
An twould yould carry half
A would have ten shares
I will knead him Ill make him supple
Hes not yet through warm force him with praises
pour in pour in his ambition is dry
To AGAMEMNON  My lord you feed too much on this dislike
Our noble general do not do so
You must prepare to fight without Achilles
Why tis this naming of him does him harm
Here is a manbut tis before his face
I will be silent
Wherefore should you so
He is not emulous as Achilles is
Know the whole world he is as valiant
A whoreson dog that shall pelter thus with us
Would he were a Trojan
What a vice were it in Ajax now
If he were proud
Or covetous of praise
Ay or surly borne
Or strange or selfaffected
Thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure
Praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck
Famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature
Thrice famed beyond all erudition
But he that disciplined thy arms to fight
Let Mars divide eternity in twain
And give him half and for thy vigour
Bullbearing Milo his addition yield
To sinewy Ajax I will not praise thy wisdom
Which like a bourn a pale a shore confines
Thy spacious and dilated parts heres Nestor
Instructed by the antiquary times
He must he is he cannot but be wise
Put pardon father Nestor were your days
As green as Ajax and your brain so temperd
You should not have the eminence of him
But be as Ajax
Shall I call you father
Ay my good son
Be ruled by him Lord Ajax
There is no tarrying here the hart Achilles
Keeps thicket Please it our great general
To call together all his state of war
Fresh kings are come to Troy tomorrow
We must with all our main of power stand fast
And heres a lordcome knights from east to west
And cull their flower Ajax shall cope the best
Go we to council Let Achilles sleep
Light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep

No sir he stays for you to conduct him thither
O here he comes
Enter TROILUS
How now how now

Exit Boy
Have you seen my cousin
No Pandarus I stalk about her door
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
Staying for waftage O be thou my Charon
And give me swift transportance to those fields
Where I may wallow in the lilybeds
Proposed for the deserver O gentle Pandarus
From Cupids shoulder pluck his painted wings
And fly with me to Cressid
Walk here i the orchard Ill bring her straight
Exit
I am giddy expectation whirls me round
The imaginary relish is so sweet
That it enchants my sense what will it be
When that the watery palate tastes indeed
Loves thrice repured nectar death I fear me
Swooning destruction or some joy too fine
Too subtlepotent tuned too sharp in sweetness
For the capacity of my ruder powers
I fear it much and I do fear besides
That I shall lose distinction in my joys
As doth a battle when they charge on heaps
The enemy flying
Reenter PANDARUS
Shes making her ready shell come straight you
must be witty now She does so blush and fetches
her wind so short as if she were frayed with a
sprite Ill fetch her It is the prettiest
villain she fetches her breath as short as a
newtaen sparrow
Exit
Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse
And all my powers do their bestowing lose
Like vassalage at unawares encountering
The eye of majesty
Reenter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA
Come come what need you blush shames a baby
Here she is now swear the oaths now to her that
you have sworn to me What are you gone again
you must be watched ere you be made tame must you
Come your ways come your ways an you draw backward
well put you i the fills Why do you not speak to
her Come draw this curtain and lets see your
picture Alas the day how loath you are to offend
daylight an twere dark yould close sooner
So so rub on and kiss the mistress How now
a kiss in feefarm build there carpenter the air
is sweet Nay you shall fight your hearts out ere
I part you The falcon as the tercel for all the
ducks i the river go to go to
You have bereft me of all words lady
Words pay no debts give her deeds but shell
bereave you o the deeds too if she call your
In witness whereof the parties interchangeably
Come in come in Ill go get a fire
Exit
Will you walk in my lord
O Cressida how often have I wished me thus
Wished my lord The gods grantO my lord
What should they grant what makes this pretty
abruption What too curious dreg espies my sweet
lady in the fountain of our love
More dregs than water if my fears have eyes
Fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly
Blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to
fear the worst oft cures the worse
O let my lady apprehend no fear in all Cupids
pageant there is presented no monster
Nor nothing monstrous neither
Nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep
seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed
This is the monstruosity in love lady that the will
is infinite and the execution confined that the
They say all lovers swear more performance than they
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and
discharging less than the tenth part of one They
are they not monsters
Are there such such are not we praise us as we
are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go
bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion
shall have a praise in present we will not name
desert before his birth and being born his addition
shall be humble Few words to fair faith Troilus
shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can
speak truest not truer than Troilus
Will you walk in my lord
Reenter PANDARUS
What blushing still have you not done talking yet
Well uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to you
I thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you
youll give him me Be true to my lord if he
flinch chide me for it
You know now your hostages your uncles word and my
firm faith
Nay Ill give my word for her too our kindred
though they be long ere they are wooed they are
constant being won they are burs I can tell you
theyll stick where they are thrown
Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
Prince Troilus I have loved you night and day
For many weary months
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win
Hard to seem won but I was won my lord
With the first glance that everpardon me
If I confess much you will play the tyrant
I love you now but not till now so much
But I might master it in faith I lie
My thoughts were like unbridled children grown
Too headstrong for their mother See we fools
Why have I blabbd who shall be true to us
When we are so unsecret to ourselves
But though I loved you well I wood you not
And yet good faith I wishd myself a man
Or that we women had mens privilege
Of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue
For in this rapture I shall surely speak
The thing I shall repent See see your silence
Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
My very soul of counsel stop my mouth
And shall albeit sweet music issues thence
Pretty i faith
My lord I do beseech you pardon me
Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss
I am ashamed O heavens what have I done
For this time will I take my leave my lord
Your leave sweet Cressid
Leave an you take leave till tomorrow morning
Pray you content you
What offends you lady
Sir mine own company
You cannot shun Yourself
Let me go and try
I have a kind of self resides with you
But an unkind self that itself will leave
To be anothers fool I would be gone
Where is my wit I know not what I speak
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
Perchance my lord I show more craft than love
And fell so roundly to a large confession
To angle for your thoughts but you are wise
Or else you love not for to be wise and love
Exceeds mans might that dwells with gods above
O that I thought it could be in a woman
As if it can I will presume in you
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love
To keep her constancy in plight and youth
Outliving beautys outward with a mind
That doth renew swifter than blood decays
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me
That my integrity and truth to you
Might be affronted with the match and weight
Of such a winnowd purity in love
How were I then uplifted but alas
I am as true as truths simplicity
And simpler than the infancy of truth
In that Ill war with you
O virtuous fight
When right with right wars who shall be most right
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truths by Troilus when their rhymes
Full of protest of oath and big compare
Want similes truth tired with iteration
As true as steel as plantage to the moon
As sun to day as turtle to her mate
As iron to adamant as earth to the centre
Yet after all comparisons of truth
As truths authentic author to be cited
As true as Troilus shall crown up the verse
And sanctify the numbers
Prophet may you be
If I be false or swerve a hair from truth
When time is old and hath forgot itself
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy
And blind oblivion swallowd cities up
To dusty nothing yet let memory
From false to false among false maids in love
Upbraid my falsehood when theyve said as false
As air as water wind or sandy earth
As fox to lamb as wolf to heifers calf
Pard to the hind or stepdame to her son
Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
As false as Cressid
Go to a bargain made seal it seal it Ill be the
witness Here I hold your hand here my cousins
If ever you prove false one to another since I have
taken such pains to bring you together let all
pitiful goersbetween be called to the worlds end
after my name call them all Pandars let all
constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids
and all brokersbetween Pandars say amen
Amen
Amen
Amen Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
bed which bed because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters press it to death away
And Cupid grant all tonguetied maidens here
Bed chamber Pandar to provide this gear

Made tame and most familiar to my nature
And here to do you service am become
As new into the world strange unacquainted
I do beseech you as in way of taste
To give me now a little benefit
Out of those many registerd in promise
Which you say live to come in my behalf
What wouldst thou of us Trojan make demand
You have a Trojan prisoner calld Antenor
Yesterday took Troy holds him very dear
Oft have youoften have you thanks therefore
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange
Whom Troy hath still denied but this Antenor
I know is such a wrest in their affairs
That their negotiations all must slack
Wanting his manage and they will almost
Give us a prince of blood a son of Priam
In change of him let him be sent great princes
And he shall buy my daughter and her presence
Shall quite strike off all service I have done
In most accepted pain
Let Diomedes bear him
And bring us Cressid hither Calchas shall have
What he requests of us Good Diomed
Furnish you fairly for this interchange
Withal bring word if Hector will tomorrow
Be answerd in his challenge Ajax is ready
This shall I undertake and tis a burden
Which I am proud to bear
Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS before their tent
Achilles stands i the entrance of his tent
Please it our general to pass strangely by him
As if he were forgot and princes all
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him
I will come last Tis like hell question me
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him
If so I have derision medicinable
To use between your strangeness and his pride
Which his own will shall have desire to drink
It may be good pride hath no other glass
To show itself but pride for supple knees
Feed arrogance and are the proud mans fees
Well execute your purpose and put on
A form of strangeness as we pass along
So do each lord and either greet him not
Or else disdainfully which shall shake him more
Than if not lookd on I will lead the way
What comes the general to speak with me
You know my mind Ill fight no more gainst Troy
What says Achilles would he aught with us
Would you my lord aught with the general
No
Nothing my lord
The better
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
Good day good day
How do you how do you
Exit
What does the cuckold scorn me
How now Patroclus
Good morrow Ajax
Ha
Good morrow
Ay and good next day too
Exit
What mean these fellows Know they not Achilles
They pass by strangely they were used to bend
To send their smiles before them to Achilles
To come as humbly as they used to creep
To holy altars
What am I poor of late
Tis certain greatness once falln out with fortune
Must fall out with men too what the declined is
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer
And not a man for being simply man
Hath any honour but honour for those honours
That are without him as place riches favour
Prizes of accident as oft as merit
Which when they fall as being slippery standers
The love that leand on them as slippery too
Do one pluck down another and together
Die in the fall But tis not so with me
Fortune and I are friends I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess
Save these mens looks who do methinks find out
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given Here is Ulysses
Ill interrupt his reading
How now Ulysses
Now great Thetis son
What are you reading
A strange fellow here
Writes me That man how dearly ever parted
How much in having or without or in
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath
Nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
As when his virtues shining upon others
Heat them and they retort that heat again
To the first giver
This is not strange Ulysses
The beauty that is borne here in the face
The bearer knows not but commends itself
To others eyes nor doth the eye itself
That most pure spirit of sense behold itself
Not going from itself but eye to eye opposed
Salutes each other with each others form
For speculation turns not to itself
Till it hath travelld and is mirrord there
Where it may see itself This is not strange at all
I do not strain at the position
It is familiarbut at the authors drift
Who in his circumstance expressly proves
That no man is the lord of any thing
Though in and of him there be much consisting
Till he communicate his parts to others
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Till he behold them formd in the applause
Where theyre extended who like an arch
reverberates
The voice again or like a gate of steel
Fronting the sun receives and renders back
His figure and his heat  I was much wrapt in this
And apprehended here immediately
The unknown Ajax
Heavens what a man is there a very horse
That has he knows not what Nature what things there are
Most abject in regard and dear in use
What things again most dear in the esteem
And poor in worth Now shall we see tomorrow
Ajax renownd O heavens what some men do
While some men leave to do
How some men creep in skittish fortunes hall
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
How one man eats into anothers pride
While pride is fasting in his wantonness
To see these Grecian lordswhy even already
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder
As if his foot were on brave Hectors breast
And great Troy shrieking
I do believe it for they passd by me
As misers do by beggars neither gave to me
Good word nor look what are my deeds forgot
Time hath my lord a wallet at his back
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion
A greatsized monster of ingratitudes
Those scraps are good deeds past which are devourd
As fast as they are made forgot as soon
As done perseverance dear my lord
Keeps honour bright to have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
In monumental mockery Take the instant way
For honour travels in a strait so narrow
Where one but goes abreast keep then the path
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue if you give way
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright
Like to an enterd tide they all rush by
And leave you hindmost
Or like a gallant horse falln in first rank
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear
Oerrun and trampled on then what they do in present
Though less than yours in past must oertop yours
For time is like a fashionable host
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand
And with his arms outstretchd as he would fly
Grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles
And farewell goes out sighing O let not
virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was
For beauty wit
High birth vigour of bone desert in service
Love friendship charity are subjects all
To envious and calumniating time
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin
That all with one consent praise newborn gawds
Though they are made and moulded of things past
And give to dust that is a little gilt
More laud than gilt oerdusted
The present eye praises the present object
Then marvel not thou great and complete man
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Than what not stirs The cry went once on thee
And still it might and yet it may again
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
And case thy reputation in thy tent
Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
Made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves
Of this my privacy
I have strong reasons
But gainst your privacy
The reasons are more potent and heroical
Tis known Achilles that you are in love
With one of Priams daughters
Ha known
Is that a wonder
The providence thats in a watchful state
Knows almost every grain of Plutus gold
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps
Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
There is a mysterywith whom relation
Durst never meddlein the soul of state
Which hath an operation more divine
Than breath or pen can give expressure to
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
As perfectly is ours as yours my lord
And better would it fit Achilles much
To throw down Hector than Polyxena
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
Great Hectors sister did Achilles win
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him
Farewell my lord I as your lover speak
The fool slides oer the ice that you should break
Exit
To this effect Achilles have I moved you
A woman impudent and mannish grown
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
They think my little stomach to the war
And your great love to me restrains you thus
Sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
And like a dewdrop from the lions mane
Be shook to air
Shall Ajax fight with Hector
Ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
I see my reputation is at stake
My fame is shrewdly gored
O then beware
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
Omission to do what is necessary
Seals a commission to a blank of danger
And danger like an ague subtly taints
Even then when we sit idly in the sun
Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus
Ill send the fool to Ajax and desire him
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
To see us here unarmd I have a womans longing
An appetite that I am sick withal
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace
To talk with him and to behold his visage
Even to my full of view
Enter THERSITES
A labour saved
A wonder
What
Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself
How so
He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector and is so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
raves in saying nothing
How can that be
Why he stalks up and down like a peacocka stride
and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning
bites his lip with a politic regard as who should
say There were wit in this head an twould out
and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire
in a flint which will not show without knocking
The mans undone forever for if Hector break not his
neck i the combat hell break t himself in
vainglory He knows not me I said Good morrow
Ajax and he replies Thanks Agamemnon What think
you of this man that takes me for the general Hes
grown a very landfish languageless a monster
A plague of opinion a man may wear it on both
sides like a leather jerkin
Thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites
Who I why hell answer nobody he professes not
answering speaking is for beggars he wears his
tongue ins arms I will put on his presence let
Patroclus make demands to me you shall see the
pageant of Ajax
To him Patroclus tell him I humbly desire the
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
to come unarmed to my tent and to procure
safeconduct for his person of the magnanimous
and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonoured
captaingeneral of the Grecian army Agamemnon
et cetera Do this
Jove bless great Ajax
Hum
I come from the worthy Achilles
Ha
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent
Hum
And to procure safeconduct from Agamemnon
Agamemnon
Ay my lord
Ha
What say you tot
God b wi you with all my heart
Your answer sir
If tomorrow be a fair day by eleven oclock it will
go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me
ere he has me
Your answer sir
Fare you well with all my heart
Why but he is not in this tune is he
No but hes out o tune thus What music will be in
him when Hector has knocked out his brains I know
not but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo
get his sinews to make catlings on
Come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight
Let me bear another to his horse for thats the more
capable creature
My mind is troubled like a fountain stirrd
And I myself see not the bottom of it
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again
that I might water an ass at it I had rather be a
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance
Exit
Enter from one side AENEAS and Servant with a  torch from the other PARIS DEIPHOBUS ANTENOR DIOMEDES and others with torches
See ho who is that there
It is the Lord AEneas
Is the prince there in person
Had I so good occasion to lie long
As you prince Paris nothing but heavenly business
Should rob my bedmate of my company
Thats my mind too Good morrow Lord AEneas
A valiant Greek AEneastake his hand
Witness the process of your speech wherein
You told how Diomed a whole week by days
Did haunt you in the field
Health to you valiant sir
During all question of the gentle truce
But when I meet you armd as black defiance
As heart can think or courage execute
The one and other Diomed embraces
Our bloods are now in calm and so long health
But when contention and occasion meet
By Jove Ill play the hunter for thy life
With all my force pursuit and policy
And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
With his face backward In humane gentleness
Welcome to Troy now by Anchises life
Welcome indeed By Venus hand I swear
No man alive can love in such a sort
The thing he means to kill more excellently
We sympathize Jove let AEneas live
If to my sword his fate be not the glory
A thousand complete courses of the sun
But in mine emulous honour let him die
With every joint a wound and that tomorrow
We know each other well
We do and long to know each other worse
This is the most despiteful gentle greeting
The noblest hateful love that eer I heard of
What business lord so early
I was sent for to the king but why I know not
His purpose meets you twas to bring this Greek
To Calchas house and there to render him
For the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid
Lets have your company or if you please
Haste there before us I constantly do think
Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge
My brother Troilus lodges there tonight
Rouse him and give him note of our approach
With the whole quality wherefore I fear
We shall be much unwelcome
That I assure you
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy
There is no help
The bitter disposition of the time
Will have it so On lord well follow you
Good morrow all
Exit with Servant
And tell me noble Diomed faith tell me true
Even in the soul of sound goodfellowship
Who in your thoughts merits fair Helen best
Myself or Menelaus
Both alike
He merits well to have her that doth seek her
Not making any scruple of her soilure
With such a hell of pain and world of charge
And you as well to keep her that defend her
Not palating the taste of her dishonour
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends
He like a puling cuckold would drink up
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
You like a lecher out of whorish loins
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors
Both merits poised each weighs nor less nor more
But he as he the heavier for a whore
You are too bitter to your countrywoman
Shes bitter to her country hear me Paris
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
A Grecians life hath sunk for every scruple
Of her contaminated carrion weight
A Trojan hath been slain since she could speak
She hath not given so many good words breath
As for her Greeks and Trojans sufferd death
Fair Diomed you do as chapmen do
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
But we in silence hold this virtue well
Well but commend what we intend to sell
Here lies our way
Exeunt
Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA
Dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold
Then sweet my lord Ill call mine uncle down
He shall unbolt the gates
Trouble him not
To bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
As infants empty of all thought
Good morrow then
I prithee now to bed
Are you aweary of me
O Cressida but that the busy day
Waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer
I would not from thee
Night hath been too brief
Beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays
As tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love
With wings more momentaryswift than thought
You will catch cold and curse me
Prithee tarry
You men will never tarry
O foolish Cressid I might have still held off
And then you would have tarried Hark
theres one up
Within  What s all the doors open here
It is your uncle
A pestilence on him now will he be mocking
I shall have such a life
Enter PANDARUS
How now how now how go maidenheads Here you

Go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle
You bring me to do and then you flout me too
To do what to do what let her say

Come come beshrew your heart youll neer be good
Nor suffer others
Ha ha Alas poor wretch ah poor capocchia

man let it sleep a bugbear take him

Knocking within
Whos that at door good uncle go and see

You smile and mock me as if I meant naughtily
Ha ha

Knocking within

Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA
Whos there whats the matter will you beat

Enter AENEAS
Good morrow lord good morrow
Whos there my Lord AEneas By my troth

Reenter TROILUS
How now whats the matter
My lord I scarce have leisure to salute you
My matter is so rash there is at hand
Paris your brother and Deiphobus
The Grecian Diomed and our Antenor
Deliverd to us and for him forthwith
Ere the first sacrifice within this hour
We must give up to Diomedes hand
The Lady Cressida
Is it so concluded
By Priam and the general state of Troy
They are at hand and ready to effect it
How my achievements mock me
I will go meet them and my Lord AEneas
We met by chance you did not find me here
Good good my lord the secrets of nature
Have not more gift in taciturnity
Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS
Ist possible no sooner got but lost The devil
take Antenor the young prince will go mad a
plague upon Antenor I would they had broke s neck
Reenter CRESSIDA
How now whats the matter who was here
Ah ah
Why sigh you so profoundly wheres my lord gone
Tell me sweet uncle whats the matter
Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above
O the gods whats the matter
Prithee get thee in would thou hadst neer been
born I knew thou wouldst be his death O poor
gentleman A plague upon Antenor
Good uncle I beseech you on my knees beseech you
whats the matter
Thou must be gone wench thou must be gone thou
art changed for Antenor thou must to thy father
and be gone from Troilus twill be his death
twill be his bane he cannot bear it
O you immortal gods I will not go
Thou must
I will not uncle I have forgot my father
I know no touch of consanguinity
No kin no love no blood no soul so near me
As the sweet Troilus O you gods divine
Make Cressids name the very crown of falsehood
If ever she leave Troilus Time force and death
Do to this body what extremes you can
But the strong base and building of my love
Is as the very centre of the earth
Drawing all things to it Ill go in and weep
Do do
Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
With sounding Troilus I will not go from Troy
Exeunt
Enter PARIS TROILUS AENEAS DEIPHOBUS ANTENOR and DIOMEDES
It is great morning and the hour prefixd
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon Good my brother Troilus
Tell you the lady what she is to do
And haste her to the purpose
Walk into her house
Ill bring her to the Grecian presently
And to his hand when I deliver her
Think it an altar and thy brother Troilus
A priest there offering to it his own heart
Exit
I know what tis to love
And would as I shall pity I could help
Please you walk in my lords
Exeunt
Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA
Be moderate be moderate
Why tell you me of moderation
The grief is fine full perfect that I taste
And violenteth in a sense as strong
As that which causeth it how can I moderate it
If I could temporize with my affection
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate
The like allayment could I give my grief
My love admits no qualifying dross
No more my grief in such a precious loss
Here here here he comes
Enter TROILUS
Ah sweet ducks
O Troilus Troilus
Embracing him
What a pair of spectacles is here
Let me embrace too O heart as the goodly saying is
O heart heavy heart
Why sighst thou without breaking
where he answers again
Because thou canst not ease thy smart
By friendship nor by speaking
There was never a truer rhyme Let us cast away
nothing for we may live to have need of such a
verse we see it we see it How now lambs
Cressid I love thee in so straind a purity
That the blessd gods as angry with my fancy
More bright in zeal than the devotion which
Cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me
Have the gods envy
Ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case
And is it true that I must go from Troy
A hateful truth
What and from Troilus too
From Troy and Troilus
Is it possible
And suddenly where injury of chance
Puts back leavetaking justles roughly by
All time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
Of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
Our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath
We two that with so many thousand sighs
Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
With the rude brevity and discharge of one
Injurious time now with a robbers haste
Crams his rich thievery up he knows not how
As many farewells as be stars in heaven
With distinct breath and consignd kisses to them
He fumbles up into a lose adieu
And scants us with a single famishd kiss
Distasted with the salt of broken tears
Within  My lord is the lady ready
Hark you are calld some say the Genius so
Cries come to him that instantly must die
Bid them have patience she shall come anon
Where are my tears rain to lay this wind or
my heart will be blown up by the root
Exit
I must then to the Grecians
No remedy
A woful Cressid mongst the merry Greeks
When shall we see again
Hear me my love be thou but true of heart
I true how now what wicked deem is this
Nay we must use expostulation kindly
For it is parting from us
I speak not be thou true as fearing thee
For I will throw my glove to Death himself
That theres no maculation in thy heart
But be thou true say I to fashion in
My sequent protestation be thou true
And I will see thee
O you shall be exposed my lord to dangers
As infinite as imminent but Ill be true
And Ill grow friend with danger Wear this sleeve
And you this glove When shall I see you
I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels
To give thee nightly visitation
But yet be true
O heavens be true again
Hear while I speak it love
The Grecian youths are full of quality
Theyre loving well composed with gifts of nature
Flowing and swelling oer with arts and exercise
How novelty may move and parts with person
Alas a kind of godly jealousy
Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin
Makes me afeard
O heavens you love me not
Die I a villain then
In this I do not call your faith in question
So mainly as my merit I cannot sing
Nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
Nor play at subtle games fair virtues all
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant
But I can tell that in each grace of these
There lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil
That tempts most cunningly but be not tempted
Do you think I will
No
But something may be done that we will not
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers
Presuming on their changeful potency
Within  Nay good my lord
Come kiss and let us part
Within  Brother Troilus
Good brother come you hither
And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you
My lord will you be true
Who I alas it is my vice my fault
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion
I with great truth catch mere simplicity
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare
Fear not my truth the moral of my wit
Is plain and true theres all the reach of it
Enter AENEAS PARIS ANTENOR DEIPHOBUS and DIOMEDES
Welcome Sir Diomed here is the lady
Which for Antenor we deliver you
At the port lord Ill give her to thy hand
And by the way possess thee what she is
Entreat her fair and by my soul fair Greek
If eer thou stand at mercy of my sword
Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
As Priam is in Ilion
Fair Lady Cressid
So please you save the thanks this prince expects
The lustre in your eye heaven in your cheek
Pleads your fair usage and to Diomed
You shall be mistress and command him wholly
Grecian thou dost not use me courteously
To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
In praising her I tell thee lord of Greece
She is as far highsoaring oer thy praises
As thou unworthy to be calld her servant
I charge thee use her well even for my charge
For by the dreadful Pluto if thou dost not
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard
Ill cut thy throat
O be not moved Prince Troilus
Let me be privileged by my place and message
To be a speaker free when I am hence
Ill answer to my lust and know you lord
Ill nothing do on charge to her own worth
She shall be prized but that you say bet so
Ill speak it in my spirit and honour no
Come to the port Ill tell thee Diomed
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head
Lady give me your hand and as we walk
To our own selves bend we our needful talk
Exeunt TROILUS CRESSIDA and DIOMEDES
Trumpet within
Hark Hectors trumpet
How have we spent this morning
The prince must think me tardy and remiss
That sore to ride before him to the field
Tis Troilus fault come come to field with him
Let us make ready straight
Yea with a bridegrooms fresh alacrity
Let us address to tend on Hectors heels
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
On his fair worth and single chivalry
Exeunt
Enter AJAX armed AGAMEMNON ACHILLES PATROCLUS MENELAUS ULYSSES NESTOR and others
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
Anticipating time with starting courage
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy
Thou dreadful Ajax that the appalled air
May pierce the head of the great combatant
And hale him hither
Thou trumpet theres my purse
Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe
Blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek
Outswell the colic of puffd Aquilon
Come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood
Thou blowst for Hector
Trumpet sounds
No trumpet answers
Tis but early days
Is not yond Diomed with Calchas daughter
Tis he I ken the manner of his gait
He rises on the toe that spirit of his
In aspiration lifts him from the earth
Enter DIOMEDES with CRESSIDA
Is this the Lady Cressid
Even she
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks sweet lady
Our general doth salute you with a kiss
Yet is the kindness but particular
Twere better she were kissd in general
And very courtly counsel Ill begin
So much for Nestor
Ill take what winter from your lips fair lady
Achilles bids you welcome
I had good argument for kissing once
But thats no argument for kissing now
For this poppd Paris in his hardiment
And parted thus you and your argument
O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns
The first was Menelaus kiss this mine
Patroclus kisses you
O this is trim
Paris and I kiss evermore for him
Ill have my kiss sir Lady by your leave
In kissing do you render or receive
Both take and give
Ill make my match to live
The kiss you take is better than you give
Therefore no kiss
Ill give you boot Ill give you three for one
Youre an odd man give even or give none
An odd man lady every man is odd
No Paris is not for you know tis true
That you are odd and he is even with you
You fillip me o the head
No Ill be sworn
It were no match your nail against his horn
May I sweet lady beg a kiss of you
You may
I do desire it
Why beg then
Why then for Venus sake give me a kiss
When Helen is a maid again and his
I am your debtor claim it when tis due
Nevers my day and then a kiss of you
Lady a word Ill bring you to your father
Exit with CRESSIDA
A woman of quick sense
Fie fie upon her
Theres language in her eye her cheek her lip
Nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body
O these encounterers so glib of tongue
That give accosting welcome ere it comes
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
To every ticklish reader set them down
For sluttish spoils of opportunity
And daughters of the game
Trumpet within
The Trojans trumpet
Yonder comes the troop
Enter HECTOR armed AENEAS TROILUS and other Trojans with Attendants
Hail all you state of Greece what shall be done
To him that victory commands or do you purpose
A victor shall be known will you the knights
Shall to the edge of all extremity
Pursue each other or shall be divided
By any voice or order of the field
Hector bade ask
Which way would Hector have it
He cares not hell obey conditions
Tis done like Hector but securely done
A little proudly and great deal misprizing
The knight opposed
If not Achilles sir
What is your name
If not Achilles nothing
Therefore Achilles but whateer know this
In the extremity of great and little
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector
The one almost as infinite as all
The other blank as nothing Weigh him well
And that which looks like pride is courtesy
This Ajax is half made of Hectors blood
In love whereof half Hector stays at home
Half heart half hand half Hector comes to seek
This blended knight half Trojan and half Greek
A maiden battle then O I perceive you
Reenter DIOMEDES
Here is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight
Stand by our Ajax as you and Lord AEneas
Consent upon the order of their fight
So be it either to the uttermost
Or else a breath the combatants being kin
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin
AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists
They are opposed already
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy
The youngest son of Priam a true knight
Not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmd
His heart and hand both open and both free
For what he has he gives what thinks he shows
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath
Manly as Hector but more dangerous
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
Is more vindicative than jealous love
They call him Troilus and on him erect
A second hope as fairly built as Hector
Thus says AEneas one that knows the youth
Even to his inches and with private soul
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me
Alarum Hector and Ajax fight
Now Ajax hold thine own
Hector thou sleepst
Awake thee
His blows are well disposed there Ajax
You must no more
Trumpets cease
Princes enough so please you
I am not warm yet let us fight again
As Hector pleases
Why then will I no more
Thou art great lord my fathers sisters son
A cousingerman to great Priams seed
The obligation of our blood forbids
A gory emulation twixt us twain
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
That thou couldst say This hand is Grecian all
And this is Trojan the sinews of this leg
All Greek and this all Troy my mothers blood
Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
Bounds in my fathers by Jove multipotent
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay
That any drop thou borrowdst from thy mother
My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
Be draind Let me embrace thee Ajax
By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
Hector would have them fall upon him thus
Cousin all honour to thee
I thank thee Hector
Thou art too gentle and too free a man
I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
A great addition earned in thy death
Not Neoptolemus so mirable
On whose bright crest Fame with her loudst Oyes
Cries This is he could promise to himself
A thought of added honour torn from Hector
There is expectance here from both the sides
What further you will do
Well answer it
The issue is embracement Ajax farewell
If I might in entreaties find success
As seld I have the chanceI would desire
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents
Tis Agamemnons wish and great Achilles
Doth long to see unarmd the valiant Hector
AEneas call my brother Troilus to me
And signify this loving interview
To the expecters of our Trojan part
Desire them home Give me thy hand my cousin
I will go eat with thee and see your knights
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here
The worthiest of them tell me name by name
But for Achilles mine own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size
Worthy of arms as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy
But thats no welcome understand more clear
Whats past and whats to come is strewd with husks
And formless ruin of oblivion
But in this extant moment faith and troth
Straind purely from all hollow biasdrawing
Bids thee with most divine integrity
From heart of very heart great Hector welcome
I thank thee most imperious Agamemnon
To TROILUS  My wellfamed lord of Troy no
less to you
Let me confirm my princely brothers greeting
You brace of warlike brothers welcome hither
Who must we answer
The noble Menelaus
O you my lord by Mars his gauntlet thanks
Mock not that I affect the untraded oath
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus glove
Shes well but bade me not commend her to you
Name her not now sir shes a deadly theme
O pardon I offend
I have thou gallant Trojan seen thee oft
Labouring for destiny make cruel way
Through ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee
As hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed
Despising many forfeits and subduements
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i the air
Not letting it decline on the declined
That I have said to some my standers by
Lo Jupiter is yonder dealing life
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath
When that a ring of Greeks have hemmd thee in
Like an Olympian wrestling this have I seen
But this thy countenance still lockd in steel
I never saw till now I knew thy grandsire
And once fought with him he was a soldier good
But by great Mars the captain of us all
Never saw like thee Let an old man embrace thee
And worthy warrior welcome to our tents
Tis the old Nestor
Let me embrace thee good old chronicle
That hast so long walkd hand in hand with time
Most reverend Nestor I am glad to clasp thee
I would my arms could match thee in contention
As they contend with thee in courtesy
I would they could
Ha
By this white beard Ild fight with thee tomorrow
Well welcome welcome I have seen the time
I wonder now how yonder city stands
When we have here her base and pillar by us
I know your favour Lord Ulysses well
Ah sir theres many a Greek and Trojan dead
Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
In Ilion on your Greekish embassy
Sir I foretold you then what would ensue
My prophecy is but half his journey yet
For yonder walls that pertly front your town
Yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
Must kiss their own feet
I must not believe you
There they stand yet and modestly I think
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
A drop of Grecian blood the end crowns all
And that old common arbitrator Time
Will one day end it
So to him we leave it
Most gentle and most valiant Hector welcome
After the general I beseech you next
To feast with me and see me at my tent
I shall forestall thee Lord Ulysses thou
Now Hector I have fed mine eyes on thee
And quoted joint by joint
Is this Achilles
I am Achilles
Stand fair I pray thee let me look on thee
Behold thy fill
Nay I have done already
Thou art too brief I will the second time
As I would buy thee view thee limb by limb
O like a book of sport thoult read me oer
But theres more in me than thou understandst
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
Tell me you heavens in which part of his body
Shall I destroy him whether there or there or there
That I may give the local wound a name
And make distinct the very breach whereout
Hectors great spirit flew answer me heavens
It would discredit the blest gods proud man
To answer such a question stand again
Thinkst thou to catch my life so pleasantly
As to prenominate in nice conjecture
Where thou wilt hit me dead
I tell thee yea
Wert thou an oracle to tell me so
Id not believe thee Henceforth guard thee well
For Ill not kill thee there nor there nor there
But by the forge that stithied Mars his helm
Ill kill thee every where yea oer and oer
You wisest Grecians pardon me this brag
His insolence draws folly from my lips
But Ill endeavour deeds to match these words
Or may I never
Do not chafe thee cousin
And you Achilles let these threats alone
Till accident or purpose bring you tot
You may have every day enough of Hector
If you have stomach the general state I fear
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him
I pray you let us see you in the field
We have had pelting wars since you refused
The Grecians cause
Dost thou entreat me Hector
Tomorrow do I meet thee fell as death
Tonight all friends
Thy hand upon that match
First all you peers of Greece go to my tent
There in the full convive we afterwards
As Hectors leisure and your bounties shall
Concur together severally entreat him
Beat loud the tabourines let the trumpets blow
That this great soldier may his welcome know
Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES
My Lord Ulysses tell me I beseech you
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep
At Menelaus tent most princely Troilus
There Diomed doth feast with him tonight
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
On the fair Cressid
Shall sweet lord be bound to you so much
After we part from Agamemnons tent
To bring me thither
You shall command me sir
As gentle tell me of what honour was
This Cressida in Troy Had she no lover there
That wails her absence
O sir to such as boasting show their scars
A mock is due Will you walk on my lord
She was beloved she loved she is and doth
But still sweet love is food for fortunes tooth
Exeunt
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Ill heat his blood with Greekish wine tonight
Which with my scimitar Ill cool tomorrow

My sweet Patroclus I am thwarted quite
From my great purpose in tomorrows battle
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba
A token from her daughter my fair love

Come come Thersites help to trim my tent
This night in banqueting must all be spent
Away Patroclus
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
With too much blood and too little brain these two

You look upon that sleeve behold it well
He loved meO false wenchGivet me again
Whose wast
It is no matter now I havet again
I will not meet with you tomorrow night
I prithee Diomed visit me no more
Now she sharpens well said whetstone
I shall have it
What this
Ay that
O all you gods O pretty pretty pledge
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
Of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it
As I kiss thee Nay do not snatch it from me
He that takes that doth take my heart withal
I had your heart before this follows it
I did swear patience
You shall not have it Diomed faith you shall not
Ill give you something else
I will have this whose was it
It is no matter
Come tell me whose it was
Twas ones that loved me better than you will
But now you have it take it
Whose was it
By all Dianas waitingwomen yond
And by herself I will not tell you whose
Tomorrow will I wear it on my helm
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it
Wert thou the devil and worest it on thy horn
It should be challenged
Well well tis done tis past and yet it is not
I will not keep my word
Why then farewell
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again
You shall not go one cannot speak a word

I do not like this fooling
Nor I by Pluto but that that likes not you pleases me best
What shall I come the hour
Ay comeO Jovedo comeI shall be plagued
Farewell till then
Good night I prithee come
Exit DIOMEDES
Troilus farewell one eye yet looks on thee
But with my heart the other eye doth see
Ah poor our sex this fault in us I find
The error of our eye directs our mind
What error leads must err O then conclude
Minds swayd by eyes are full of turpitude
Exit
A proof of strength she could not publish more
Unless she said  My mind is now turnd whore
Alls done my lord
It is
Why stay we then
To make a recordation to my soul
Of every syllable that here was spoke
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart
An esperance so obstinately strong
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears
As if those organs had deceptious functions
Created only to calumniate
Was Cressid here
I cannot conjure Trojan
She was not sure
Most sure she was
Why my negation hath no taste of madness
Nor mine my lord Cressid was here but now
Let it not be believed for womanhood
Think we had mothers do not give advantage
To stubborn critics apt without a theme
For depravation to square the general sex
By Cressids rule rather think this not Cressid
What hath she done prince that can soil our mothers
Nothing at all unless that this were she
Will he swagger himself out ons own eyes
This she no this is Diomeds Cressida
If beauty have a soul this is not she
If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies
If sanctimony be the gods delight
If there be rule in unity itself
This is not she O madness of discourse
That cause sets up with and against itself
Bifold authority where reason can revolt
Without perdition and loss assume all reason
Without revolt this is and is not Cressid
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
Divides more wider than the sky and earth
And yet the spacious breadth of this division
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
As Ariachnes broken woof to enter
Instance O instance strong as Plutos gates
Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
Instance O instance strong as heaven itself
The bonds of heaven are slippd dissolved and loosed
And with another knot fivefingertied
The fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics
Of her oereaten faith are bound to Diomed
May worthy Troilus be half attachd
With that which here his passion doth express
Ay Greek and that shall be divulged well
Inflamed with Venus never did young man fancy
With so eternal and so fixd a soul
Hark Greek as much as I do Cressid love
So much by weight hate I her Diomed
That sleeve is mine that hell bear on his helm
Were it a casque composed by Vulcans skill
My sword should bite it not the dreadful spout
Which shipmen do the hurricano call
Constringed in mass by the almighty sun
Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptunes ear
In his descent than shall my prompted sword
Falling on Diomed
Hell tickle it for his concupy
O Cressid O false Cressid false false false
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name
And theyll seem glorious
O contain yourself
Your passion draws ears hither
Enter AENEAS
I have been seeking you this hour my lord
Hector by this is arming him in Troy
Ajax your guard stays to conduct you home
Have with you prince My courteous lord adieu
Farewell revolted fair and Diomed
Stand fast and wear a castle on thy head
Ill bring you to the gates
Exeunt TROILUS AENEAS and ULYSSES
Would I could meet that rogue Diomed I would
croak like a raven I would bode I would bode
Patroclus will give me any thing for the
intelligence of this whore the parrot will not
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab
Lechery lechery still wars and lechery nothing
else holds fashion a burning devil take them
Exit
Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE
When was my lord so much ungently temperd

By all the everlasting gods Ill go
My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day
No more I say
Enter CASSANDRA
Where is my brother Hector
Here sister armd and bloody in intent
Consort with me in loud and dear petition
Pursue we him on knees for I have dreamd
Of bloody turbulence and this whole night
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter
O tis true
Ho bid my trumpet sound
No notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother
Be gone I say the gods have heard me swear
The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
They are polluted offerings more abhorrd
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice
O be persuaded do not count it holy
To hurt by being just it is as lawful
For we would give much to use violent thefts
And rob in the behalf of charity
It is the purpose that makes strong the vow
But vows to every purpose must not hold
Unarm sweet Hector
Hold you still I say
Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate
Lie every man holds dear but the brave man
Holds honour far more preciousdear than life
Enter TROILUS
How now young man meanst thou to fight today
Cassandra call my father to persuade
Exit CASSANDRA
No faith young Troilus doff thy harness youth
I am today i the vein of chivalry
Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war
Unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy
Ill stand today for thee and me and Troy
Brother you have a vice of mercy in you
Which better fits a lion than a man
What vice is that good Troilus chide me for it
When many times the captive Grecian falls
Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword
You bid them rise and live
Otis fair play
Fools play by heaven Hector
How now how now
For the love of all the gods
Lets leave the hermit pity with our mothers
And when we have our armours buckled on
The venomd vengeance ride upon our swords
Spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth
Fie savage fie
Hector then tis wars
Troilus I would not have you fight today
Who should withhold me
Not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars
Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees
Their eyes oergalled with recourse of tears
Not you my brother with your true sword drawn
Opposed to  hinder me should stop my way
But by my ruin
Reenter CASSANDRA with PRIAM
Lay hold upon him Priam hold him fast
He is thy crutch now if thou lose thy stay
Thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee
Fall all together
Come Hector come go back
Thy wife hath dreamd thy mother hath had visions
Cassandra doth foresee and I myself
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
To tell thee that this day is ominous
Therefore come back
AEneas is afield
And I do stand engaged to many Greeks
Even in the faith of valour to appear
This morning to them
Ay but thou shalt not go
I must not break my faith
You know me dutiful therefore dear sir
Let me not shame respect but give me leave
To take that course by your consent and voice
Which you do here forbid me royal Priam
O Priam yield not to him
Do not dear father
Andromache I am offended with you
Upon the love you bear me get you in
Exit ANDROMACHE
This foolish dreaming superstitious girl
Makes all these bodements
O farewell dear Hector
Look how thou diest look how thy eye turns pale
Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents
Hark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries out
How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth
Like witless antics one another meet
And all cry Hector Hectors dead O Hector
Away away
Farewell yet soft Hector take my leave
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive
Exit
You are amazed my liege at her exclaim
Go in and cheer the town well forth and fight
Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night
Farewell the gods with safety stand about thee

and what one thing what another that I shall
leave you one o these days and I have a rheum
in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones
that unless a man were cursed I cannot tell what
to think ont What says she there
Words words mere words no matter from the heart
The effect doth operate another way
Tearing the letter
Go wind to wind there turn and change together
My love with words and errors still she feeds
But edifies another with her deeds
Exeunt severally

And foams at mouth and he is armd and at it

Look Hector how the sun begins to set
How ugly night comes breathing at his heels
Even with the vail and darking of the sun
To close the day up Hectors life is done
I am unarmd forego this vantage Greek
Strike fellows strike this is the man I seek
HECTOR falls
So Ilion fall thou next now Troy sink down
Here lies thy heart thy sinews and thy bone
On Myrmidons and cry you all amain
Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain
A retreat sounded
Hark a retire upon our Grecian part
The Trojan trumpets sound the like my lord
The dragon wing of night oerspreads the earth
And sticklerlike the armies separates
My halfsuppd sword that frankly would have fed
Pleased with this dainty bait thus goes to bed
Sheathes his sword
Come tie his body to my horses tail
Along the field I will the Trojan trail
Exeunt
Enter AGAMEMNON AJAX MENELAUS NESTOR DIOMEDES and others marching Shouts within
Hark hark what shout is that
Peace drums
Within
Achilles Achilles Hectors slain Achilles
The bruit is Hectors slain and by Achilles
If it be so yet bragless let it be
Great Hector was a man as good as he
March patiently along let one be sent
To pray Achilles see us at our tent
If in his death the gods have us befriended
Great Troy is ours and our sharp wars are ended
Exeunt marching
Enter AENEAS and Trojans
Stand ho yet are we masters of the field
Never go home here starve we out the night
Enter TROILUS
Hector is slain
Hector the gods forbid
Hes dead and at the murderers horses tail
In beastly sort draggd through the shameful field
Frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed
Sit gods upon your thrones and smile at Troy
I say at once let your brief plagues be mercy
And linger not our sure destructions on
My lord you do discomfort all the host
You understand me not that tell me so
I do not speak of flight of fear of death
But dare all imminence that gods and men
Address their dangers in Hector is gone
Who shall tell Priam so or Hecuba
Let him that will a screechowl aye be calld
Go in to Troy and say there Hectors dead
There is a word will Priam turn to stone
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives
Cold statues of the youth and in a word
Scare Troy out of itself But march away
Hector is dead there is no more to say
Stay yet You vile abominable tents
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains
Let Titan rise as early as he dare
Ill through and through you and thou greatsized coward
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates
Ill haunt thee like a wicked conscience still
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzys thoughts
Strike a free march to Troy with comfort go
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe
Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans
As TROILUS is going out enter from the other side PANDARUS
But hear you hear you
Hence brokerlackey ignomy and shame
Pursue thy life and live aye with thy name
Exit
A goodly medicine for my aching bones O world
world world thus is the poor agent despised
O traitors and bawds how earnestly are you set
awork and how ill requited why should our
endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed
what verse for it what instance for it Let me see
Full merrily the humblebee doth sing
Till he hath lost his honey and his sting
And being once subdued in armed tail
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail
Good traders in the flesh set this in your
painted cloths
As many as be here of panders hall
Your eyes half out weep out at Pandars fall
Or if you cannot weep yet give some groans
Though not for me yet for your aching bones
Brethren and sisters of the holddoor trade
Some two months hence my will shall here be made
It should be now but that my fear is this
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss
Till then Ill sweat and seek about for eases
And at that time bequeathe you my diseases
Exit
Enter DUKE ORSINO CURIO and other Lords Musicians attending
If music be the food of love play on
Give me excess of it that surfeiting
The appetite may sicken and so die
That strain again it had a dying fall
O it came oer my ear like the sweet sound
That breathes upon a bank of violets
Stealing and giving odour Enough no more
Tis not so sweet now as it was before
O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou
That notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea nought enters there
Of what validity and pitch soeer
But falls into abatement and low price
Even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy
That it alone is high fantastical
Will you go hunt my lord
What Curio
The hart
Why so I do the noblest that I have
O when mine eyes did see Olivia first
Methought she purged the air of pestilence
That instant was I turnd into a hart
And my desires like fell and cruel hounds
Eer since pursue me
Enter VALENTINE
How now what news from her
So please my lord I might not be admitted
But from her handmaid do return this answer
The element itself till seven years heat
Shall not behold her face at ample view
But like a cloistress she will veiled walk
And water once a day her chamber round
With eyeoffending brine all this to season
A brothers dead love which she would keep fresh
And lasting in her sad remembrance
O she that hath a heart of that fine frame
To pay this debt of love but to a brother
How will she love when the rich golden shaft
Hath killd the flock of all affections else
That live in her when liver brain and heart
These sovereign thrones are all supplied and filld
Her sweet perfections with one self king
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers
Lovethoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers
Exeunt
Enter VIOLA a Captain and Sailors
What country friends is this
This is Illyria lady
And what should I do in Illyria
My brother he is in Elysium
Perchance he is not drownd what think you sailors
It is perchance that you yourself were saved
O my poor brother and so perchance may he be
True madam and to comfort you with chance
Assure yourself after our ship did split
When you and those poor number saved with you
Hung on our driving boat I saw your brother
Most provident in peril bind himself
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea
Where like Arion on the dolphins back
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
So long as I could see
For saying so theres gold
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope
Whereto thy speech serves for authority
The like of him Knowst thou this country
Ay madam well for I was bred and born
Not three hours travel from this very place
Who governs here
A noble duke in nature as in name
What is the name
Orsino
Orsino I have heard my father name him
He was a bachelor then
And so is now or was so very late
For but a month ago I went from hence
And then twas fresh in murmuras you know
What great ones do the less will prattle of
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia
Whats she
A virtuous maid the daughter of a count
That died some twelvemonth since then leaving her
In the protection of his son her brother
Who shortly also died for whose dear love
They say she hath abjured the company
And sight of men
O that I served that lady
And might not be delivered to the world
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow
What my estate is
That were hard to compass
Because she will admit no kind of suit
No not the dukes
There is a fair behavior in thee captain
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Doth oft close in pollution yet of thee
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
I prithee and Ill pay thee bounteously
Conceal me what I am and be my aid
For such disguise as haply shall become
The form of my intent Ill serve this duke
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him
It may be worth thy pains for I can sing
And speak to him in many sorts of music
That will allow me very worth his service
What else may hap to time I will commit
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit
Be you his eunuch and your mute Ill be
When my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see
I thank thee lead me on

a coranto My very walk should be a jig I would not
so much as make water but in a sinkapace What

Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in mans attire
If the duke continue these favours towards you
Cesario you are like to be much advanced he hath

You either fear his humour or my negligence that
you call in question the continuance of his love
is he inconstant sir in his favours
No believe me
I thank you Here comes the count
Enter DUKE ORSINO CURIO and Attendants
Who saw Cesario ho
On your attendance my lord here
Stand you a while aloof Cesario
Thou knowst no less but all I have unclaspd
To thee the book even of my secret soul
Therefore good youth address thy gait unto her
Be not denied access stand at her doors
And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
Till thou have audience
Sure my noble lord
If she be so abandond to her sorrow
As it is spoke she never will admit me
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
Rather than make unprofited return
Say I do speak with her my lord what then
O then unfold the passion of my love
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith
She will attend it better in thy youth
Than in a nuncios of more grave aspect
I think not so my lord
Dear lad believe it
For they shall yet belie thy happy years
That say thou art a man Dianas lip
Is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe
Is as the maidens organ shrill and sound
And all is semblative a womans part
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair Some four or five attend him
All if you will for I myself am best
When least in company Prosper well in this
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
To call his fortunes thine
Ill do my best
To woo your lady
Aside

Whoeer I woo myself would be his wife

Nay either tell me where thou hast been or I will
not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
way of thy excuse my lady will hang thee for thy absence
Let her hang me he that is well hanged in this
world needs to fear no colours
Make that good
He shall see none to fear
A good lenten answer I can tell thee where that
saying was born of I fear no colours
Where good Mistress Mary
In the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery
Well God give them wisdom that have it and those
that are fools let them use their talents
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or
to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and
for turning away let summer bear it out
You are resolute then
Not so neither but I am resolved on two points
That if one break the other will hold or if both
break your gaskins fall
Apt in good faith very apt Well go thy way if
Sir Toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a
piece of Eves flesh as any in Illyria
Peace you rogue no more o that Here comes my
lady make your excuse wisely you were best

Better a witty fool than a foolish wit
Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
God bless thee lady

Two faults madonna that drink and good counsel
will amend for give the dry fool drink then is
the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend
himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if
he cannot let the botcher mend him Any thing
thats mended is but patched virtue that
transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that
amends is but patched with virtue If that this
simple syllogism will serve so if it will not
what remedy As there is no true cuckold but
calamity so beautys a flower The lady bade take
away the fool therefore I say again take her away
Sir I bade them take away you
Misprision in the highest degree Lady cucullus non
facit monachum thats as much to say as I wear not
motley in my brain Good madonna give me leave to
prove you a fool
Can you do it
Dexterously good madonna
Make your proof

soul being in heaven Take away the fool gentlemen
What think you of this fool Malvolio doth he not mend
Yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him
infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the
better fool
God send you sir a speedy infirmity for the
better increasing your folly Sir Toby will be
sworn that I am no fox but he will not pass his
word for two pence that you are no fool
How say you to that Malvolio
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
barren rascal I saw him put down the other day
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
than a stone Look you now hes out of his guard
already unless you laugh and minister occasion to
him he is gagged I protest I take these wise men
that crow so at these set kind of fools no better
than the fools zanies
Oh you are sick of selflove Malvolio and taste
with a distempered appetite To be generous
guiltless and of free disposition is to take those
things for birdbolts that you deem cannonbullets
there is no slander in an allowed fool though he do
nothing but rail nor no railing in a known discreet
man though he do nothing but reprove
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing for thou
speakest well of fools

door like a sheriffs post and be the supporter to
a bench but hell speak with you
What kind o man is he
Why of mankind
What manner of man
Of very ill manner hell speak with you will you or no
Of what personage and years is he
Not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for
a boy as a squash is before tis a peascod or a
cooling when tis almost an apple tis with him

wellfavoured and he speaks very shrewishly one

The honourable lady of the house which is she
Speak to me I shall answer for her
Your will
Most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beautyI
pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house
for I never saw her I would be loath to cast away
my speech for besides that it is excellently well
penned I have taken great pains to con it Good
beauties let me sustain no scorn I am very
comptible even to the least sinister usage
Whence came you sir
I can say little more than I have studied and that
questions out of my part Good gentle one give me
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house
that I may proceed in my speech
Are you a comedian
No my profound heart and yet by the very fangs
of malice I swear I am not that I play Are you
the lady of the house
If I do not usurp myself I am
Most certain if you are she you do usurp
yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours
to reserve But this is from my commission I will
on with my speech in your praise and then show you
the heart of my message
Come to what is important int I forgive you the praise
Alas I took great pains to study it and tis poetical
It is the more like to be feigned I pray you
keep it in I heard you were saucy at my gates
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
than to hear you If you be not mad be gone if
you have reason be brief tis not that time of
moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue
Will you hoist sail sir here lies your way
No good swabber I am to hull here a little
longer Some mollification for your giant sweet
lady Tell me your mind I am a messenger
Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when
the courtesy of it is so fearful Speak your office
It alone concerns your ear I bring no overture of
war no taxation of homage I hold the olive in my
hand my words are as fun of peace as matter
Yet you began rudely What are you what would you
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
learned from my entertainment What I am and what I
would are as secret as maidenhead to your ears
divinity to any others profanation
Give us the place alone we will hear this divinity
Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
Now sir what is your text
Most sweet lady
A comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it
Where lies your text
In Orsinos bosom
In his bosom In what chapter of his bosom
To answer by the method in the first of his heart
O I have read it it is heresy Have you no more to say
Good madam let me see your face
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
with my face You are now out of your text but
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture
Look you sir such a one I was this present ist
not well done
Unveiling
Excellently done if God did all
Tis in grain sir twill endure wind and weather
Tis beauty truly blent whose red and white
Natures own sweet and cunning hand laid on
Lady you are the cruellst she alive
If you will lead these graces to the grave
And leave the world no copy
O sir I will not be so hardhearted I will give
out divers schedules of my beauty it shall be
inventoried and every particle and utensil
labelled to my will as item two lips
indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to
them item one neck one chin and so forth Were
you sent hither to praise me
I see you what you are you are too proud
But if you were the devil you are fair
My lord and master loves you O such love
Could be but recompensed though you were crownd
The nonpareil of beauty
How does he love me
With adorations fertile tears
With groans that thunder love with sighs of fire
Your lord does know my mind I cannot love him
Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble
Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
In voices well divulged free learnd and valiant
And in dimension and the shape of nature
A gracious person but yet I cannot love him
He might have took his answer long ago
If I did love you in my masters flame
With such a suffering such a deadly life
In your denial I would find no sense
I would not understand it
Why what would you
Make me a willow cabin at your gate
And call upon my soul within the house
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
And sing them loud even in the dead of night
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
And make the babbling gossip of the air
Cry out Olivia O You should not rest
Between the elements of air and earth
But you should pity me
You might do much
What is your parentage
Above my fortunes yet my state is well
I am a gentleman
Get you to your lord
I cannot love him let him send no more
Unless perchance you come to me again
To tell me how he takes it Fare you well
I thank you for your pains spend this for me
I am no feed post lady keep your purse
My master not myself lacks recompense
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love
And let your fervor like my masters be
Placed in contempt Farewell fair cruelty
Exit
What is your parentage
Above my fortunes yet my state is well
I am a gentleman Ill be sworn thou art
Do give thee fivefold blazon not too fast

With an invisible and subtle stealth
To creep in at mine eyes Well let it be

Reenter MALVOLIO
Here madam at your service
Run after that same peevish messenger

If that the youth will come this way tomorrow
Ill give him reasons fort hie thee Malvolio

Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
Will you stay no longer nor will you not that I go with you
By your patience no My stars shine darkly over
me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
distemper yours therefore I shall crave of you your
leave that I may bear my evils alone it were a bad
recompense for your love to lay any of them on you
ANTONIO Let me yet know of you whither you are bound
No sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere
extravagancy But I perceive in you so excellent a
touch of modesty that you will not extort from me
what I am willing to keep in therefore it charges
me in manners the rather to express myself You
must know of me then Antonio my name is Sebastian
which I called Roderigo My father was that
Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard
of He left behind him myself and a sister both
born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased
would we had so ended but you sir altered that
for some hour before you took me from the breach of
the sea was my sister drowned
Alas the day
A lady sir though it was said she much resembled
me was yet of many accounted beautiful but
though I could not with such estimable wonder
overfar believe that yet thus far I will boldly
publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but
call fair She is drowned already sir with salt
water though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more
Pardon me sir your bad entertainment
O good Antonio forgive me your trouble
If you will not murder me for my love let me be
your servant
If you will not undo what you have done that is
kill him whom you have recovered desire it not
Fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that
upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
tales of me I am bound to the Count Orsinos court farewell
Exit
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee
I have many enemies in Orsinos court
Else would I very shortly see thee there
But come what may I do adore thee so
That danger shall seem sport and I will go

Enter VIOLA MALVOLIO following
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia
Even now sir on a moderate pace I have since
arrived but hither
She returns this ring to you sir you might have
saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself
She adds moreover that you should put your lord
into a desperate assurance she will none of him
and one thing more that you be never so hardy to
come again in his affairs unless it be to report
your lords taking of this Receive it so
She took the ring of me Ill none of it
Come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her
will is it should be so returned if it be worth
stooping for there it lies in your eye if not be
it his that finds it
Exit
I left no ring with her what means this lady
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmd her
She made good view of me indeed so much
That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue
She loves me sure the cunning of her passion
Invites me in this churlish messenger
None of my lords ring why he sent her none
I am the man if it be so as tis
Poor lady she were better love a dream
Disguise I see thou art a wickedness
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much
How easy is it for the properfalse
In womens waxen hearts to set their forms
Alas our frailty is the cause not we
For such as we are made of such we be
How will this fadge my master loves her dearly
And I poor monster fond as much on him
And she mistaken seems to dote on me
What will become of this As I am man
My state is desperate for my masters love
As I am womannow alas the day
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe
O time thou must untangle this not I
It is too hard a knot for me to untie

Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW
Approach Sir Andrew not to be abed after
midnight is to be up betimes and diluculo
surgere thou knowst
Nay my troth I know not but I know to be up
late is to be up late
A false conclusion I hate it as an unfilled can
To be up after midnight and to go to bed then is
early so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
to bed betimes Does not our life consist of the
four elements
Faith so they say but I think it rather consists
of eating and drinking
Thourt a scholar let us therefore eat and drink
Marian I say a stoup of wine

tinkers at this time of night Do ye make an
alehouse of my ladys house that ye squeak out your
coziers catches without any mitigation or remorse
of voice Is there no respect of place persons nor
time in you
We did keep time sir in our catches Sneck up
Sir Toby I must be round with you My lady bade me
tell you that though she harbours you as her
kinsman shes nothing allied to your disorders If
you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors you
are welcome to the house if not an it would please
you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid
you farewell
Farewell dear heart since I must needs be gone
Nay good Sir Toby
His eyes do show his days are almost done
Ist even so
But I will never die
Sir Toby there you lie
This is much credit to you
Shall I bid him go
What an if you do
Shall I bid him go and spare not
O no no no no you dare not
Out o tune sir ye lie Art any more than a
steward Dost thou think because thou art
virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale

Mistress Mary if you prized my ladys favour at any
thing more than contempt you would not give means
for this uncivil rule she shall know of it by this hand
Exit
Go shake your ears
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a mans
ahungry to challenge him the field and then to
break promise with him and make a fool of him
Dot knight Ill write thee a challenge or Ill
deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth
Sweet Sir Toby be patient for tonight since the
youth of the counts was today with thy lady she is
much out of quiet For Monsieur Malvolio let me
alone with him if I do not gull him into a
nayword and make him a common recreation do not
think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed
I know I can do it
Possess us possess us tell us something of him
Marry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritan
O if I thought that Ild beat him like a dog
What for being a puritan thy exquisite reason
dear knight
I have no exquisite reason fort but I have reason
good enough
The devil a puritan that he is or any thing
constantly but a timepleaser an affectioned ass
that cons state without book and utters it by great
swarths the best persuaded of himself so
crammed as he thinks with excellencies that it is
his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
him and on that vice in him will my revenge find
notable cause to work
What wilt thou do
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape
of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure
of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find
himself most feelingly personated I can write very
like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we
can hardly make distinction of our hands
Excellent I smell a device
I havet in my nose too
He shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop
that they come from my niece and that shes in
love with him
My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour
And your horse now would make him an ass
Ass I doubt not
O twill be admirable
Sport royal I warrant you I know my physic will
work with him I will plant you two and let the
fool make a third where he shall find the letter
observe his construction of it For this night to
bed and dream on the event Farewell
Exit
Good night Penthesilea
Before me shes a good wench
Shes a beagle truebred and one that adores me

I was adored once too
Lets to bed knight Thou hadst need send for
more money
If I cannot recover your niece I am a foul way out
Send for money knight if thou hast her not i
the end call me cut
If I do not never trust me take it how you will
Come come Ill go burn some sack tis too late
to go to bed now come knight come knight
Exeunt
Enter DUKE ORSINO VIOLA CURIO and others
Give me some music Now good morrow friends
Now good Cesario but that piece of song
That old and antique song we heard last night
Methought it did relieve my passion much
More than light airs and recollected terms
Of these most brisk and giddypaced times
Come but one verse
He is not here so please your lordship that should sing it
Who was it
Feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady
Olivias father took much delight in He is about the house
Seek him out and play the tune the while
Exit CURIO Music plays
Come hither boy if ever thou shalt love
In the sweet pangs of it remember me
For such as I am all true lovers are
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else
Save in the constant image of the creature
That is beloved How dost thou like this tune
It gives a very echo to the seat
Where Love is throned
Thou dost speak masterly
My life upont young though thou art thine eye
Hath stayd upon some favour that it loves
Hath it not boy
A little by your favour
What kind of woman ist
Of your complexion
She is not worth thee then What years i faith
About your years my lord
Too old by heaven let still the woman take
An elder than herself so wears she to him
So sways she level in her husbands heart
For boy however we do praise ourselves
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
More longing wavering sooner lost and worn
Than womens are
I think it well my lord
Then let thy love be younger than thyself
Or thy affection cannot hold the bent
For women are as roses whose fair flower
Being once displayd doth fall that very hour
And so they are alas that they are so
To die even when they to perfection grow
Reenter CURIO and Clown
O fellow come the song we had last night
Mark it Cesario it is old and plain
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
Do use to chant it it is silly sooth
And dallies with the innocence of love
Like the old age
Are you ready sir
Ay prithee sing
Music
SONG
Come away come away death
And in sad cypress let me be laid
Fly away fly away breath
I am slain by a fair cruel maid
My shroud of white stuck all with yew
O prepare it
My part of death no one so true
Did share it
Not a flower not a flower sweet
On my black coffin let there be strown
Not a friend not a friend greet
My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
A thousand thousand sighs to save
Lay me O where
Sad true lover never find my grave
To weep there
Theres for thy pains
No pains sir I take pleasure in singing sir
Ill pay thy pleasure then
Truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another
Give me now leave to leave thee
Now the melancholy god protect thee and the
tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for
thy mind is a very opal I would have men of such
constancy put to sea that their business might be
every thing and their intent every where for thats
it that always makes a good voyage of nothing Farewell
Exit
Let all the rest give place
CURIO and Attendants retire
Once more Cesario
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
Tell her my love more noble than the world
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands
The parts that fortune hath bestowd upon her
Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune
But tis that miracle and queen of gems
But if she cannot love you sir
I cannot be so answerd
Sooth but you must
Say that some lady as perhaps there is
Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
As you have for Olivia you cannot love her
You tell her so must she not then be answerd
There is no womans sides
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
As love doth give my heart no womans heart
So big to hold so much they lack retention
Alas their love may be calld appetite
No motion of the liver but the palate
That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
But mine is all as hungry as the sea
And can digest as much make no compare
Between that love a woman can bear me
And that I owe Olivia
Ay but I know
What dost thou know
Too well what love women to men may owe
In faith they are as true of heart as we
My father had a daughter loved a man
As it might be perhaps were I a woman
I should your lordship
And whats her history
A blank my lord She never told her love
But let concealment like a worm i the bud
Feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought
And with a green and yellow melancholy
She sat like patience on a monument
Smiling at grief Was not this love indeed
We men may say more swear more but indeed
Our shows are more than will for still we prove
Much in our vows but little in our love
But died thy sister of her love my boy
I am all the daughters of my fathers house
And all the brothers too and yet I know not
Sir shall I to this lady
Ay thats the theme
To her in haste give her this jewel say
My love can give no place bide no denay
Exeunt

Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
rascally sheepbiter come by some notable shame

Enter MALVOLIO
Tis but fortune all is fortune Maria once told
me she did affect me and I have heard herself come
thus near that should she fancy it should be one
of my complexion Besides she uses me with a more
exalted respect than any one else that follows her
What should I think ont
Heres an overweening rogue
O peace Contemplation makes a rare turkeycock
of him how he jets under his advanced plumes
Slight I could so beat the rogue
Peace I say
To be Count Malvolio
Ah rogue
Pistol him pistol him
Peace peace
There is example fort the lady of the Strachy
married the yeoman of the wardrobe
Fie on him Jezebel
O peace now hes deeply in look how
imagination blows him
Having been three months married to her sitting in
my state
O for a stonebow to hit him in the eye
Calling my officers about me in my branched velvet
gown having come from a daybed where I have left
Olivia sleeping
Fire and brimstone
O peace peace
And then to have the humour of state and after a
demure travel of regard telling them I know my
place as I would they should do theirs to for my
kinsman Toby
Bolts and shackles
O peace peace peace now now
Seven of my people with an obedient start make
out for him I frown the while and perchance wind
up watch or play with mysome rich jewel Toby
approaches courtesies there to me
Shall this fellow live
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace
I extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar
smile with an austere regard of control
And does not Toby take you a blow o the lips then
Saying Cousin Toby my fortunes having cast me on
your niece give me this prerogative of speech
What what
You must amend your drunkenness
Out scab
Nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot
Besides you waste the treasure of your time with

loves me She did commend my yellow stockings of
late she did praise my leg being crossgartered
and in this she manifests herself to my love and
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
of her liking I thank my stars I am happy I will
be strange stout in yellow stockings and
crossgartered even with the swiftness of putting
on Jove and my stars be praised Here is yet a
postscript

Thou canst not choose but know who I am If thou

I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
of thousands to be paid from the Sophy
I could marry this wench for this device
So could I too
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
Nor I neither
Here comes my noble gullcatcher
Reenter MARIA
Wilt thou set thy foot o my neck
Or o mine either
Shall I play my freedom at traytrip and become thy
bondslave
I faith or I either
Why thou hast put him in such a dream that when
the image of it leaves him he must run mad
Nay but say true does it work upon him
Like aquavitae with a midwife
If you will then see the fruits of the sport mark
his first approach before my lady he will come to
her in yellow stockings and tis a colour she
abhors and crossgartered a fashion she detests
and he will smile upon her which will now be so
unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a
melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him
into a notable contempt If you will see it follow
me
To the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of wit
Ill make one too
Exeunt
Enter VIOLA and Clown with a tabour
Save thee friend and thy music dost thou live by
thy tabour
No sir I live by the church
Art thou a churchman
No such matter sir I do live by the church for
I do live at my house and my house doth stand by
the church
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a
beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy
tabour if thy tabour stand by the church
You have said sir To see this age A sentence is
but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the
wrong side may be turned outward
Nay thats certain they that dally nicely with
words may quickly make them wanton
I would therefore my sister had had no name sir
Why man
Why sir her names a word and to dally with that
word might make my sister wanton But indeed words
are very rascals since bonds disgraced them
Thy reason man
Troth sir I can yield you none without words and
words are grown so false I am loath to prove
reason with them
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing
Not so sir I do care for something but in my
conscience sir I do not care for you if that be
to care for nothing sir I would it would make you invisible
Art not thou the Lady Olivias fool
No indeed sir the Lady Olivia has no folly she
will keep no fool sir till she be married and
fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
herrings the husbands the bigger I am indeed not
her fool but her corrupter of words
I saw thee late at the Count Orsinos
Foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun
it shines every where I would be sorry sir but
the fool should be as oft with your master as with
my mistress I think I saw your wisdom there
Nay an thou pass upon me Ill no more with thee
Hold theres expenses for thee
Now Jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard
By my troth Ill tell thee I am almost sick for
one
Aside
though I would not have it grow on my chin Is thy
lady within
Would not a pair of these have bred sir
Yes being kept together and put to use
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir to bring
a Cressida to this Troilus
I understand you sir tis well begged
The matter I hope is not great sir begging but
a beggar Cressida was a beggar My lady is
within sir I will construe to them whence you
come who you are and what you would are out of my
welkin I might say element but the word is overworn
Exit
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool
And to do that well craves a kind of wit
He must observe their mood on whom he jests
The quality of persons and the time
And like the haggard cheque at every feather
As full of labour as a wise mans art
For folly that he wisely shows is fit
But wise men follyfalln quite taint their wit
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW
Save you gentleman
And you sir
Dieu vous garde monsieur
Et vous aussi votre serviteur
I hope sir you are and I am yours
Will you encounter the house my niece is desirous
you should enter if your trade be to her
I am bound to your niece sir I mean she is the
list of my voyage
Taste your legs sir put them to motion
My legs do better understand me sir than I
understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs
I mean to go sir to enter
I will answer you with gait and entrance But we
are prevented
Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
Most excellent accomplished lady the heavens rain
odours on you
That youths a rare courtier Rain odours well
My matter hath no voice to your own most pregnant
and vouchsafed ear
Odours pregnant and vouchsafed Ill get em
all three all ready
Let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH SIR ANDREW and MARIA
Give me your hand sir
My duty madam and most humble service
What is your name
Cesario is your servants name fair princess
My servant sir Twas never merry world
Since lowly feigning was calld compliment
Youre servant to the Count Orsino youth
And he is yours and his must needs be yours
Your servants servant is your servant madam
For him I think not on him for his thoughts
Would they were blanks rather than filld with me
Madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts
On his behalf
O by your leave I pray you
I bade you never speak again of him
But would you undertake another suit
I had rather hear you to solicit that
Than music from the spheres
Dear lady
Give me leave beseech you I did send
After the last enchantment you did here
A ring in chase of you so did I abuse
Myself my servant and I fear me you
Under your hard construction must I sit
To force that on you in a shameful cunning
Which you knew none of yours what might you think
Have you not set mine honour at the stake
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
That tyrannous heart can think To one of your receiving
Enough is shown a cypress not a bosom
Hideth my heart So let me hear you speak
I pity you
Thats a degree to love
No not a grize for tis a vulgar proof
That very oft we pity enemies
Why then methinks tis time to smile again
O world how apt the poor are to be proud
If one should be a prey how much the better
To fall before the lion than the wolf
Clock strikes
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time
Be not afraid good youth I will not have you
And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest
Your were is alike to reap a proper man
There lies your way due west
Then westwardho Grace and good disposition
Attend your ladyship
Youll nothing madam to my lord by me
Stay
I prithee tell me what thou thinkest of me
That you do think you are not what you are
If I think so I think the same of you
Then think you right I am not what I am
I would you were as I would have you be
Would it be better madam than I am
I wish it might for now I am your fool
O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
In the contempt and anger of his lip
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
Than love that would seem hid loves night is noon
Cesario by the roses of the spring
By maidhood honour truth and every thing
I love thee so that maugre all thy pride
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause
For that I woo thou therefore hast no cause
But rather reason thus with reason fetter
Love sought is good but given unsought better
By innocence I swear and by my youth
I have one heart one bosom and one truth
And that no woman has nor never none
Shall mistress be of it save I alone
And so adieu good madam never more
Will I my masters tears to you deplore
Yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move
That heart which now abhors to like his love
Exeunt
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH SIR ANDREW and FABIAN
No faith Ill not stay a jot longer
Thy reason dear venom give thy reason
You must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew
Marry I saw your niece do more favours to the
counts servingman than ever she bestowed upon me
I sawt i the orchard
Did she see thee the while old boy tell me that
As plain as I see you now
This was a great argument of love in her toward you
Slight will you make an ass o me
I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of
judgment and reason
And they have been grandjurymen since before Noah
was a sailor
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to
put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
You should then have accosted her and with some
excellent jests firenew from the mint you should
have banged the youth into dumbness This was
looked for at your hand and this was balked the
double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
off and you are now sailed into the north of my
ladys opinion where you will hang like an icicle
on a Dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by
some laudable attempt either of valour or policy
Ant be any way it must be with valour for policy
I hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a
politician
Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
valour Challenge me the counts youth to fight
with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall
take note of it and assure thyself there is no
lovebroker in the world can more prevail in mans
commendation with woman than report of valour
There is no way but this Sir Andrew
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him
Go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief
it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and fun
of invention taunt him with the licence of ink
if thou thoust him some thrice it shall not be
amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
paper although the sheet were big enough for the
bed of Ware in England set em down go about it
Let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou
write with a goosepen no matter about it
Where shall I find you
Well call thee at the cubiculo go
Exit SIR ANDREW
This is a dear manikin to you Sir Toby
I have been dear to him lad some two thousand
strong or so
We shall have a rare letter from him but youll
not delivert
Never trust me then and by all means stir on the
youth to an answer I think oxen and wainropes
cannot hale them together For Andrew if he were
opened and you find so much blood in his liver as
will clog the foot of a flea Ill eat the rest of
the anatomy
And his opposite the youth bears in his visage no
great presage of cruelty
Enter MARIA
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes
If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourself
into stitches follow me Yond gull Malvolio is
turned heathen a very renegado for there is no
Christian that means to be saved by believing
rightly can ever believe such impossible passages
of grossness Hes in yellow stockings
And crossgartered
Most villanously like a pedant that keeps a school
i the church I have dogged him like his
murderer He does obey every point of the letter
that I dropped to betray him he does smile his
face into more lines than is in the new map with the
augmentation of the Indies you have not seen such
a thing as tis I can hardly forbear hurling things
at him I know my lady will strike him if she do
hell smile and taket for a great favour
Come bring us bring us where he is
Exeunt
Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
I would not by my will have troubled you
But since you make your pleasure of your pains
I will no further chide you
I could not stay behind you my desire
More sharp than filed steel did spur me forth
And not all love to see you though so much
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage
But jealousy what might befall your travel
Being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
Unguided and unfriended often prove
Rough and unhospitable my willing love
The rather by these arguments of fear
Set forth in your pursuit
My kind Antonio
I can no other answer make but thanks
And thanks and ever           oft good turns
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay
But were my worth as is my conscience firm
You should find better dealing Whats to do
Shall we go see the reliques of this town
Tomorrow sir best first go see your lodging
I am not weary and tis long to night
I pray you let us satisfy our eyes
With the memorials and the things of fame
That do renown this city
Would yould pardon me
I do not without danger walk these streets
Once in a seafight gainst the count his galleys
I did some service of such note indeed
That were I taen here it would scarce be answerd
Belike you slew great number of his people
The offence is not of such a bloody nature
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
Might well have given us bloody argument
It might have since been answerd in repaying
What we took from them which for traffics sake
Most of our city did only myself stood out
For which if I be lapsed in this place
I shall pay dear
Do not then walk too open
It doth not fit me Hold sir heres my purse

Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
With viewing of the town there shall you have me

You have desire to purchase and your store
I think is not for idle markets sir
Ill be your pursebearer and leave you
For an hour
To the Elephant

Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
O ho do you come near me now no worse man than
Sir Toby to look to me This concurs directly with
the letter she sends him on purpose that I may
appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that
in the letter Cast thy humble slough says she
be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put
thyself into the trick of singularity and
consequently sets down the manner how as a sad
face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the
habit of some sir of note and so forth I have
limed her but it is Joves doing and Jove make me
thankful And when she went away now Let this
fellow be looked to fellow not Malvolio nor
after my degree but fellow Why every thing
adheres together that no dram of a scruple no
scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous
or unsafe circumstanceWhat can be said Nothing
that can be can come between me and the full
prospect of my hopes Well Jove not I is the
doer of this and he is to be thanked

Exit
Ist possible
If this were played upon a stage now I could
condemn it as an improbable fiction
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device man
Nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint
Why we shall make him mad indeed
The house will be the quieter
Come well have him in a dark room and bound My
niece is already in the belief that hes mad we
may carry it thus for our pleasure and his penance
till our very pastime tired out of breath prompt
us to have mercy on him at which time we will
bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
finder of madmen But see but see

A good note that keeps you from the blow of the law
Reads  Thou comest to the lady Olivia and in my

throat that is not the matter I challenge thee for
Very brief and to exceeding good senseless

ANDREW AGUECHEEK
If this letter move him not his legs cannot
Ill givet him
You may have very fit occasion fort he is now in
some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
Go Sir Andrew scout me for him at the corner the
orchard like a bumbaily so soon as ever thou seest
him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for
it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a
swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood
more approbation than ever proof itself would have
earned him Away
Nay let me alone for swearing
Exit
Now will not I deliver his letter for the behavior
of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
capacity and breeding his employment between his
lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this
letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no
terror in the youth he will find it comes from a
clodpole But sir I will deliver his challenge by
word of mouth set upon Aguecheek a notable report
of valour and drive the gentleman as I know his
youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous
opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
This will so fright them both that they will kill
one another by the look like cockatrices
Reenter OLIVIA with VIOLA
Here he comes with your niece give them way till
he take leave and presently after him
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
for a challenge
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH FABIAN and MARIA
I have said too much unto a heart of stone
And laid mine honour too unchary out
Theres something in me that reproves my fault
But such a headstrong potent fault it is
That it but mocks reproof
With the same havior that your passion bears
Goes on my masters grief
Here wear this jewel for me tis my picture
Refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you
And I beseech you come again tomorrow
What shall you ask of me that Ill deny
That honour saved may upon asking give
Nothing but this your true love for my master
How with mine honour may I give him that
Which I have given to you
I will acquit you
Well come again tomorrow fare thee well
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell
Exit
Reenter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN

That defence thou hast betake thee tot of what
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know

the hunter attends thee at the orchardend
dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for
thy assailant is quick skilful and deadly
You mistake sir I am sure no man hath any quarrel
to me my remembrance is very free and clear from
any image of offence done to any man
Youll find it otherwise I assure you therefore
if you hold your life at any price betake you to
your guard for your opposite hath in him what
youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal
I pray you sir what is he
He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
carpet consideration but he is a devil in private
brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and
his incensement at this moment is so implacable
and sepulchre Hob nob is his word givet or taket
I will return again into the house and desire some
conduct of the lady I am no fighter I have heard
of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
others to taste their valour belike this is a man
of that quirk
Sir no his indignation derives itself out of a
very competent injury therefore get you on and
give him his desire Back you shall not to the
house unless you undertake that with me which with
as much safety you might answer him therefore on
or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you
must thats certain or forswear to wear iron about you
This is as uncivil as strange I beseech you do me
this courteous office as to know of the knight what
my offence to him is it is something of my
negligence nothing of my purpose
I will do so Signior Fabian stay you by this
gentleman till my return
Exit
Pray you sir do you know of this matter
I know the knight is incensed against you even to a
mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more
I beseech you what manner of man is he
Nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by
his form as you are like to find him in the proof
of his valour He is indeed sir the most skilful
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
have found in any part of Illyria Will you walk
towards him I will make your peace with him if I
can
I shall be much bound to you fort I am one that
had rather go with sir priest than sir knight I
care not who knows so much of my mettle

bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now
scarce to be worth talking of therefore draw for

Than what befalls myself You stand amazed
But be of comfort
Come sir away
I must entreat of you some of that money
What money sir
For the fair kindness you have showd me here
And part being prompted by your present trouble
Out of my lean and low ability
Ill lend you something my having is not much
Ill make division of my present with you
Hold theres half my coffer
Will you deny me now
Ist possible that my deserts to you
Can lack persuasion Do not tempt my misery
Lest that it make me so unsound a man
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
That I have done for you
I know of none
Nor know I you by voice or any feature
I hate ingratitude more in a man
Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
Inhabits our frail blood
O heavens themselves
Come sir I pray you go
Let me speak a little This youth that you see here
I snatchd one half out of the jaws of death
Relieved him with such sanctity of love
And to his image which methought did promise
Most venerable worth did I devotion
Whats that to us The time goes by away
But O how vile an idol proves this god
Thou hast Sebastian done good feature shame
In nature theres no blemish but the mind
None can be calld deformd but the unkind
Virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil
Are empty trunks oerflourishd by the devil
The man grows mad away with him Come come sir
Lead me on
Exit with Officers
Methinks his words do from such passion fly
That he believes himself so do not I
Prove true imagination O prove true
That I dear brother be now taen for you
Come hither knight come hither Fabian well
whisper oer a couplet or two of most sage saws
He named Sebastian I my brother know
Yet living in my glass even such and so
In favour was my brother and he went
Still in this fashion colour ornament
For him I imitate O if it prove
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love
Exit
A very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than
a hare his dishonesty appears in leaving his
friend here in necessity and denying him and for
his cowardship ask Fabian

Fie thou dishonest Satan I call thee by the most
modest terms for I am one of those gentle ones
that will use the devil himself with courtesy
sayest thou that house is dark
As hell Sir Topas
Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes
and the clearstores toward the south north are as
lustrous as ebony and yet complainest thou of
obstruction
I am not mad Sir Topas I say to you this house is dark
Madman thou errest I say there is no darkness
but ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than
the Egyptians in their fog
I say this house is as dark as ignorance though
ignorance were as dark as hell and I say there
was never man thus abused I am no more mad than you
are make the trial of it in any constant question
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird
What thinkest thou of his opinion
I think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion
Fare thee well Remain thou still in darkness
thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
allow of thy wits and fear to kill a woodcock lest
thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam Fare thee well
Sir Topas Sir Topas
My most exquisite Sir Topas
Nay I am for all waters
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
gown he sees thee not
To him in thine own voice and bring me word how

Exit
Enter SEBASTIAN
This is the air that is the glorious sun
This pearl she gave me I do feelt and seet
And though tis wonder that enwraps me thus
Yet tis not madness Wheres Antonio then
I could not find him at the Elephant
Yet there he was and there I found this credit
That he did range the town to seek me out
His counsel now might do me golden service
For though my soul disputes well with my sense
That this may be some error but no madness
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
So far exceed all instance all discourse
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
To any other trust but that I am mad
Or else the ladys mad yet if twere so
She could not sway her house command her followers
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
With such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
As I perceive she does theres something int
That is deceiveable But here the lady comes
Enter OLIVIA and Priest
Blame not this haste of mine If you mean well
Now go with me and with this holy man
Into the chantry by there before him
And underneath that consecrated roof
Plight me the full assurance of your faith
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
May live at peace He shall conceal it
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note
What time we will our celebration keep
According to my birth What do you say
Ill follow this good man and go with you
And having sworn truth ever will be true
Then lead the way good father and heavens so shine
Exeunt
Enter Clown and FABIAN
Now as thou lovest me let me see his letter
Good Master Fabian grant me another request
Any thing
Do not desire to see this letter
This is to give a dog and in recompense desire my
dog again
Enter DUKE ORSINO VIOLA CURIO and Lords
Belong you to the Lady Olivia friends
Ay sir we are some of her trappings
I know thee well how dost thou my good fellow
Truly sir the better for my foes and the worse
for my friends
Just the contrary the better for thy friends
No sir the worse
How can that be
Marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me
now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass so that by
my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself
and by my friends I am abused so that
conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives
make your two affirmatives why then the worse for
my friends and the better for my foes
Why this is excellent
By my troth sir no though it please you to be
one of my friends
Thou shalt not be the worse for me theres gold
But that it would be doubledealing sir I would
you could make it another
O you give me ill counsel
Put your grace in your pocket sir for this once
and let your flesh and blood obey it
Well I will be so much a sinner to be a
doubledealer theres another
Primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old
saying is the third pays for all the triplex
sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of
Saint Bennet sir may put you in mind one two three
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw
if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
with her and bring her along with you it may awake
my bounty further
Marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come
again I go sir but I would not have you to think
that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness
but as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I
will awake it anon
Exit
Here comes the man sir that did rescue me
Enter ANTONIO and Officers
That face of his I do remember well
Yet when I saw it last it was besmeard
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war
A bawbling vessel was he captain of
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable
With which such scathful grapple did he make
With the most noble bottom of our fleet
That very envy and the tongue of loss
Cried fame and honour on him Whats the matter
Orsino this is that Antonio
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy
And this is he that did the Tiger board
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg
Here in the streets desperate of shame and state
In private brabble did we apprehend him
He did me kindness sir drew on my side
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me
Notable pirate thou saltwater thief
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
Whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
Hast made thine enemies
Orsino noble sir
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate
Though I confess on base and ground enough
Orsinos enemy A witchcraft drew me hither
That most ingrateful boy there by your side
From the rude seas enraged and foamy mouth
Did I redeem a wreck past hope he was
His life I gave him and did thereto add
My love without retention or restraint
All his in dedication for his sake
Did I expose myself pure for his love
Into the danger of this adverse town
Drew to defend him when he was beset
Where being apprehended his false cunning
Not meaning to partake with me in danger
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink denied me mine own purse
Which I had recommended to his use
Not half an hour before
How can this be
When came he to this town
Today my lord and for three months before
No interim not a minutes vacancy
Both day and night did we keep company
Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
Here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth
But for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness
Three months this youth hath tended upon me
But more of that anon Take him aside
What would my lord but that he may not have
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable
Cesario you do not keep promise with me
Madam
Gracious Olivia
What do you say Cesario Good my lord
My lord would speak my duty hushes me
If it be aught to the old tune my lord
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
As howling after music
Still so cruel
Still so constant lord
What to perverseness you uncivil lady
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
My soul the faithfullst offerings hath breathed out
That eer devotion tenderd What shall I do
Even what it please my lord that shall become him
Why should I not had I the heart to do it
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death
Kill what I lovea savage jealousy
That sometimes savours nobly But hear me this
Since you to nonregardance cast my faith
And that I partly know the instrument
That screws me from my true place in your favour
Live you the marblebreasted tyrant still
But this your minion whom I know you love
And whom by heaven I swear I tender dearly
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye
Where he sits crowned in his masters spite
Come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief
Ill sacrifice the lamb that I do love
To spite a ravens heart within a dove
And I most jocund apt and willingly
To do you rest a thousand deaths would die
Where goes Cesario
After him I love
More than I love these eyes more than my life
More by all mores than eer I shall love wife
If I do feign you witnesses above
Punish my life for tainting of my love
Ay me detested how am I beguiled
Who does beguile you who does do you wrong
Hast thou forgot thyself is it so long
Call forth the holy father
Come away
Whither my lord Cesario husband stay
Husband
Ay husband can he that deny
Her husband sirrah
No my lord not I
Alas it is the baseness of thy fear
That makes thee strangle thy propriety
Fear not Cesario take thy fortunes up
Be that thou knowst thou art and then thou art
As great as that thou fearst
Enter Priest
O welcome father
Father I charge thee by thy reverence
Here to unfold though lately we intended
To keep in darkness what occasion now
Reveals before tis ripe what thou dost know
Hath newly passd between this youth and me
Confirmd by mutual joinder of your hands
Attested by the holy close of lips
Strengthend by interchangement of your rings
Seald in my function by my testimony
Since when my watch hath told me toward my grave
I have travelld but two hours
O thou dissembling cub what wilt thou be
When time hath sowd a grizzle on thy case
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow
Farewell and take her but direct thy feet
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet
My lord I do protest
O do not swear
Hold little faith though thou hast too much fear
Enter SIR ANDREW
For the love of God a surgeon Send one presently
to Sir Toby
Whats the matter
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
a bloody coxcomb too for the love of God your
help I had rather than forty pound I were at home
Who has done this Sir Andrew
The counts gentleman one Cesario we took him for
a coward but hes the very devil incardinate
My gentleman Cesario
Ods lifelings here he is You broke my head for
nothing and that that I did I was set on to dot
by Sir Toby
Why do you speak to me I never hurt you
You drew your sword upon me without cause
But I bespoke you fair and hurt you not
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me I
think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
Here comes Sir Toby halting you shall hear more
but if he had not been in drink he would have
tickled you othergates than he did
How now gentleman how ist with you
Thats all one has hurt me and theres the end
ont Sot didst see Dick surgeon sot
O hes drunk Sir Toby an hour agone his eyes

Then hes a rogue and a passy measures panyn I

Away with him Who hath made this havoc with them
Ill help you Sir Toby because well be dressed together
Will you help an asshead and a coxcomb and a
knave a thinfaced knave a gull
Get him to bed and let his hurt be lookd to
Exeunt Clown FABIAN SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW
Enter SEBASTIAN
I am sorry madam I have hurt your kinsman
But had it been the brother of my blood
I must have done no less with wit and safety
You throw a strange regard upon me and by that
I do perceive it hath offended you
Pardon me sweet one even for the vows
We made each other but so late ago
One face one voice one habit and two persons
A natural perspective that is and is not
Antonio O my dear Antonio
How have the hours rackd and tortured me
Since I have lost thee
Sebastian are you
Fearst thou that Antonio
How have you made division of yourself
An apple cleft in two is not more twin
Than these two creatures Which is Sebastian
Most wonderful
Do I stand there I never had a brother
Nor can there be that deity in my nature
Of here and every where I had a sister
Whom the blind waves and surges have devourd
Of charity what kin are you to me
What countryman what name what parentage
Of Messaline Sebastian was my father
Such a Sebastian was my brother too
So went he suited to his watery tomb
If spirits can assume both form and suit
You come to fright us
A spirit I am indeed
But am in that dimension grossly clad
Which from the womb I did participate
Were you a woman as the rest goes even
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek
And say Thricewelcome drowned Viola
My father had a mole upon his brow
And so had mine
And died that day when Viola from her birth
Had numberd thirteen years
O that record is lively in my soul
That day that made my sister thirteen years
If nothing lets to make us happy both
But this my masculine usurpd attire
Do not embrace me till each circumstance
Of place time fortune do cohere and jump
That I am Viola which to confirm
Ill bring you to a captain in this town
Where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
I was preserved to serve this noble count
All the occurrence of my fortune since
Hath been between this lady and this lord
To OLIVIA  So comes it lady you have been mistook
But nature to her bias drew in that
Nor are you therein by my life deceived
You are betrothd both to a maid and man
Be not amazed right noble is his blood
If this be so as yet the glass seems true
I shall have share in this most happy wreck
To VIOLA
Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me
And all those sayings will I overswear
And those swearings keep as true in soul
As doth that orbed continent the fire
That severs day from night
Give me thy hand
And let me see thee in thy womans weeds
The captain that did bring me first on shore
Is now in durance at Malvolios suit
A gentleman and follower of my ladys
He shall enlarge him fetch Malvolio hither
And yet alas now I remember me
Reenter Clown with a letter and FABIAN
From my remembrance clearly banishd his
How does he sirrah
Truly madam he holds Belzebub at the stavess end as
well as a man in his case may do has here writ a
letter to you I should have givent you today
morning but as a madmans epistles are no gospels
so it skills not much when they are delivered
Opent and read it
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
the madman
Reads
By the Lord madam
How now art thou mad
No madam I do but read madness an your ladyship
will have it as it ought to be you must allow Vox
Prithee read i thy right wits
So I do madonna but to read his right wits is to
read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear
Read it you sirrah
To FABIAN
Reads  By the Lord madam you wrong me and the
world shall know it though you have put me into
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
your ladyship I have your own letter that induced
me to the semblance I put on with the which I doubt
not but to do myself much right or you much shame
Think of me as you please I leave my duty a little
unthought of and speak out of my injury
THE MADLYUSED MALVOLIO
Did he write this
Ay madam
See him deliverd Fabian bring him hither
Exit FABIAN
My lord so please you these things further
thought on
To think me as well a sister as a wife
One day shall crown the alliance ont so please you
Here at my house and at my proper cost
Madam I am most apt to embrace your offer
To VIOLA
Your master quits you and for your service done him
So much against the mettle of your sex
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding
And since you calld me master for so long
Here is my hand you shall from this time be
Your masters mistress
A sister you are she
Reenter FABIAN with MALVOLIO
Is this the madman
Ay my lord this same
How now Malvolio
Madam you have done me wrong
Notorious wrong
Have I Malvolio no
Lady you have Pray you peruse that letter
You must not now deny it is your hand
Write from it if you can in hand or phrase
Or say tis not your seal nor your invention
You can say none of this well grant it then
And tell me in the modesty of honour
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour
Bade me come smiling and crossgarterd to you
To put on yellow stockings and to frown
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people
Why have you sufferd me to be imprisond
Kept in a dark house visited by the priest
And made the most notorious geck and gull
That eer invention playd on tell me why
Alas Malvolio this is not my writing
But out of question tis Marias hand
And now I do bethink me it was she
First told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling
And in such forms which here were presupposed
Upon thee in the letter Prithee be content
But when we know the grounds and authors of it
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
Of thine own cause
Good madam hear me speak
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
Taint the condition of this present hour
Which I have wonderd at In hope it shall not
Most freely I confess myself and Toby
Set this device against Malvolio here
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
We had conceived against him Maria writ
The letter at Sir Tobys great importance
In recompense whereof he hath married her
How with a sportful malice it was followd
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge
If that the injuries be justly weighd
That have on both sides passd
Alas poor fool how have they baffled thee
Why some are born great some achieve greatness
and some have greatness thrown upon them I was
one sir in this interlude one Sir Topas sir but
thats all one By the Lord fool I am not mad
But do you remember Madam why laugh you at such
a barren rascal an you smile not hes gagged
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
Ill be revenged on the whole pack of you
Exit
He hath been most notoriously abused
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace
He hath not told us of the captain yet
When that is known and golden time convents
A solemn combination shall be made
Of our dear souls Meantime sweet sister
We will not part from hence Cesario come
For so you shall be while you are a man
But when in other habits you are seen
Orsinos mistress and his fancys queen
Exeunt all except Clown
Sings
When that I was and a little tiny boy
With hey ho the wind and the rain
A foolish thing was but a toy
For the rain it raineth every day
But when I came to mans estate
With hey ho  and c
Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
For the rain  and c
But when I came alas to wive
With hey ho  and c
By swaggering could I never thrive
For the rain  and c
But when I came unto my beds
With hey ho  and c
With tosspots still had drunken heads
For the rain  and c
A great while ago the world begun
With hey ho  and c
But thats all one our play is done
And well strive to please you every day
Exit
Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
Cease to persuade my loving Proteus
Homekeeping youth have ever homely wits
Weret not affection chains thy tender days
To the sweet glances of thy honourd love
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad
Than living dully sluggardized at home
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
But since thou lovest love still and thrive therein
Even as I would when I to love begin
Wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu
Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest
Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
If ever danger do environ thee
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers
For I will be thy beadsman Valentine
And on a lovebook pray for my success
Upon some book I love Ill pray for thee
Thats on some shallow story of deep love
How young Leander crossd the Hellespont
Thats a deep story of a deeper love
For he was more than over shoes in love
Tis true for you are over boots in love
And yet you never swum the Hellespont
Over the boots nay give me not the boots
No I will not for it boots thee not
What
To be in love where scorn is bought with groans
Coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moments mirth
With twenty watchful weary tedious nights
If haply won perhaps a hapless gain
If lost why then a grievous labour won
However but a folly bought with wit
Or else a wit by folly vanquished
So by your circumstance you call me fool
So by your circumstance I fear youll prove
Tis love you cavil at I am not Love
Love is your master for he masters you
And he that is so yoked by a fool
Methinks should not be chronicled for wise
Yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells so eating love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all
And writers say as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turnd to folly blasting in the bud
Losing his verdure even in the prime
And all the fair effects of future hopes
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
That art a votary to fond desire
Once more adieu my father at the road
Expects my coming there to see me shippd
And thither will I bring thee Valentine
Sweet Proteus no now let us take our leave
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend
And likewise will visit thee with mine
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan
As much to you at home and so farewell
Exit
He after honour hunts I after love
He leaves his friends to dignify them more
I leave myself my friends and all for love
Thou Julia thou hast metamorphosed me
Made me neglect my studies lose my time
War with good counsel set the world at nought
Made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
Enter SPEED
Sir Proteus save you Saw you my master
But now he parted hence to embark for Milan
Twenty to one then he is shippd already
And I have playd the sheep in losing him
Indeed a sheep doth very often stray
An if the shepherd be a while away
You conclude that my master is a shepherd then
and I a sheep
I do
Why then my horns are his horns whether I wake or sleep
A silly answer and fitting well a sheep
This proves me still a sheep
True and thy master a shepherd
Nay that I can deny by a circumstance
It shall go hard but Ill prove it by another
The shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the
shepherd but I seek my master and my master seeks
not me therefore I am no sheep
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the
shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for
wages followest thy master thy master for wages
follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep
Such another proof will make me cry baa
But dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to Julia
Ay sir I a lost mutton gave your letter to her
a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a
lost mutton nothing for my labour
Heres too small a pasture for such store of muttons
If the ground be overcharged you were best stick her
Nay in that you are astray twere best pound you
Nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for
carrying your letter
You mistake I mean the pounda pinfold
From a pound to a pin fold it over and over
Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
your lover
But what said she
First nodding  Ay
NodAywhy thats noddy
You mistook sir I say she did nod and you ask
me if she did nod and I say Ay
And that set together is noddy
Now you have taken the pains to set it together
take it for your pains
No no you shall have it for bearing the letter
Well I perceive I must be fain to bear with you
Why sir how do you bear with me
Marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing
but the word noddy for my pains
Beshrew me but you have a quick wit
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse
Come come open the matter in brief what said she
Open your purse that the money and the matter may
be both at once delivered
Well sir here is for your pains What said she
Truly sir I think youll hardly win her
Why couldst thou perceive so much from her
Sir I could perceive nothing at all from her no
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter
and being so hard to me that brought your mind I
fear shell prove as hard to you in telling your
mind Give her no token but stones for shes as
hard as steel
What said she nothing
No not so much as Take this for thy pains To
testify your bounty I thank you you have testerned
me in requital whereof henceforth carry your
letters yourself and so sir Ill commend you to my master
Go go be gone to save your ship from wreck
Which cannot perish having thee aboard
Being destined to a drier death on shore
Exit SPEED
I must go send some better messenger
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines
Receiving them from such a worthless post
Exit
Enter JULlA and LUCETTA
But say Lucetta now we are alone
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
Ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
That every day with parle encounter me
In thy opinion which is worthiest love
Please you repeat their names Ill show my mind
According to my shallow simple skill
What thinkst thou of the fair Sir Eglamour
As of a knight wellspoken neat and fine
But were I you he never should be mine
What thinkst thou of the rich Mercatio
Well of his wealth but of himself so so
What thinkst thou of the gentle Proteus
Lord Lord to see what folly reigns in us
How now what means this passion at his name
Pardon dear madam tis a passing shame
That I unworthy body as I am
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen
Why not on Proteus as of all the rest
Then thus of many good I think him best
Your reason
I have no other but a womans reason
I think him so because I think him so
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
Ay if you thought your love not cast away
Why he of all the rest hath never moved me
Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye
His little speaking shows his love but small
Fire thats closest kept burns most of all
They do not love that do not show their love
O they love least that let men know their love
I would I knew his mind
Peruse this paper madam
To Julia Say from whom
That the contents will show
Say say who gave it thee
Valentines page and sent I think from Proteus
He would have given it you but I being in the way
Did in your name receive it pardon the
fault I pray
Now by my modesty a goodly broker
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
To whisper and conspire against my youth
Now trust me tis an office of great worth
And you an officer fit for the place
Or else return no more into my sight
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate
Will ye be gone
That you may ruminate
Exit
And yet I would I had oerlooked the letter
It were a shame to call her back again
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her
What a fool is she that knows I am a maid
And would not force the letter to my view
Since maids in modesty say no to that
Which they would have the profferer construe ay
Fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
And presently all humbled kiss the rod
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence
When willingly I would have had her here
How angerly I taught my brow to frown
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past
What ho Lucetta
Reenter LUCETTA
What would your ladyship
Ist near dinnertime
I would it were
That you might kill your stomach on your meat
And not upon your maid
What ist that you took up so gingerly
Nothing
Why didst thou stoop then
To take a paper up that I let fall
And is that paper nothing
Nothing concerning me
Then let it lie for those that it concerns
Madam it will not lie where it concerns
Unless it have a false interpeter
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
That I might sing it madam to a tune
Give me a note your ladyship can set
As little by such toys as may be possible
Best sing it to the tune of Light o love
It is too heavy for so light a tune
Heavy belike it hath some burden then
Ay and melodious were it would you sing it
And why not you
I cannot reach so high
Lets see your song How now minion
Keep tune there still so you will sing it out
And yet methinks I do not like this tune
You do not
No madam it is too sharp
You minion are too saucy
Nay now you are too flat
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song
The mean is drownd with your unruly bass
Indeed I bid the base for Proteus
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me
Here is a coil with protestation
Tears the letter
Go get you gone and let the papers lie
You would be fingering them to anger me
She makes it strange but she would be best pleased
To be so angerd with another letter
Exit
Nay would I were so angerd with the same
O hateful hands to tear such loving words
Injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings
Ill kiss each several paper for amends
Look here is writ kind Julia Unkind Julia
As in revenge of thy ingratitude
I throw thy name against the bruising stones
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
And here is writ lovewounded Proteus
Poor wounded name my bosom as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heald
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss
But twice or thrice was Proteus written down
Be calm good wind blow not a word away
Till I have found each letter in the letter
Except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged fearfulhanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea
Lo here in one line is his name twice writ
Poor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus
To the sweet Julia that Ill tear away
And yet I will not sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names
Thus will I fold them one on another
Now kiss embrace contend do what you will
Reenter LUCETTA
Madam
Dinner is ready and your father stays
Well let us go
What shall these papers lie like telltales here
If you respect them best to take them up
Nay I was taken up for laying them down
Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold
I see you have a months mind to them
Ay madam you may say what sights you see
I see things too although you judge I wink
Come come willt please you go
Exeunt
Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Tell me Panthino what sad talk was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister
Twas of his nephew Proteus your son
Why what of him
He wonderd that your lordship
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home
While other men of slender reputation
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out
Some to the wars to try their fortune there
Some to discover islands far away
Some to the studious universities
For any or for all these exercises
He said that Proteus your son was meet
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home
Which would be great impeachment to his age
In having known no travel in his youth
Nor needst thou much importune me to that
Whereon this month I have been hammering
I have considerd well his loss of time
And how he cannot be a perfect man
Not being tried and tutord in the world
Experience is by industry achieved
And perfected by the swift course of time
Then tell me whither were I best to send him
I think your lordship is not ignorant
How his companion youthful Valentine
Attends the emperor in his royal court
I know it well
Twere good I think your lordship sent him thither
Hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen
And be in eye of every exercise
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth
I like thy counsel well hast thou advised
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it
The execution of it shall make known
Even with the speediest expedition
I will dispatch him to the emperors court
Tomorrow may it please you Don Alphonso
With other gentlemen of good esteem
Are journeying to salute the emperor
And to commend their service to his will
Good company with them shall Proteus go
And in good time now will we break with him
Enter PROTEUS
Sweet love sweet lines sweet life
Here is her hand the agent of her heart
Here is her oath for love her honours pawn
O that our fathers would applaud our loves
To seal our happiness with their consents
O heavenly Julia
How now what letter are you reading there
Mayt please your lordship tis a word or two
Of commendations sent from Valentine
Deliverd by a friend that came from him
Lend me the letter let me see what news
There is no news my lord but that he writes
How happily he lives how well beloved
And daily graced by the emperor
Wishing me with him partner of his fortune
And how stand you affected to his wish
As one relying on your lordships will
And not depending on his friendly wish
My will is something sorted with his wish
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed
For what I will I will and there an end
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
With Valentinus in the emperors court
What maintenance he from his friends receives
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me
Tomorrow be in readiness to go
Excuse it not for I am peremptory
My lord I cannot be so soon provided
Please you deliberate a day or two
Look what thou wantst shall be sent after thee
No more of stay tomorrow thou must go
Come on Panthino you shall be employd
To hasten on his expedition
Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Thus have I shunnd the fire for fear of burning
And drenchd me in the sea where I am drownd
I feard to show my father Julias letter
Lest he should take exceptions to my love
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
Hath he excepted most against my love
O how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun
And by and by a cloud takes all away
Reenter PANTHINO
Sir Proteus your father calls for you
He is in haste therefore I pray you to go
Why this it is my heart accords thereto
And yet a thousand times it answers no
Exeunt
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
Sir your glove
Not mine my gloves are on
Why then this may be yours for this is but one
Ha let me see ay give it me its mine
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine
Ah Silvia Silvia
Madam Silvia Madam Silvia
How now sirrah
She is not within hearing sir
Why sir who bade you call her
Your worship sir or else I mistook
Well youll still be too forward
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow
Go to sir tell me do you know Madam Silvia
She that your worship loves
Why how know you that I am in love
Marry by these special marks first you have
learned like Sir Proteus to wreathe your arms
like a malecontent to relish a lovesong like a
robinredbreast to walk alone like one that had
the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had
lost his A B C to weep like a young wench that had
buried her grandam to fast like one that takes
diet to watch like one that fears robbing to
speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas You were
wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you
walked to walk like one of the lions when you
fasted it was presently after dinner when you
looked sadly it was for want of money and now you
are metamorphosed with a mistress that when I look
on you I can hardly think you my master
Are all these things perceived in me
They are all perceived without ye
Without me they cannot
Without you nay thats certain for without you
were so simple none else would but you are so
without these follies that these follies are within
you and shine through you like the water in an
urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a
physician to comment on your malady
But tell me dost thou know my lady Silvia
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
Hast thou observed that even she I mean
Why sir I know her not
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet
knowest her not
Is she not hardfavoured sir
Not so fair boy as wellfavoured
Sir I know that well enough
What dost thou know
That she is not so fair as of you wellfavoured
I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite
Thats because the one is painted and the other out
of all count
How painted and how out of count
Marry sir so painted to make her fair that no
man counts of her beauty
How esteemest thou me I account of her beauty
You never saw her since she was deformed
How long hath she been deformed
Ever since you loved her
I have loved her ever since I saw her and still I
see her beautiful
If you love her you cannot see her
Why
Because Love is blind O that you had mine eyes
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
ungartered
What should I see then
Your own present folly and her passing deformity
for he being in love could not see to garter his
hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose
Belike boy then you are in love for last
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes
True sir I was in love with my bed I thank you
you swinged me for my love which makes me the
bolder to chide you for yours
In conclusion I stand affected to her
I would you were set so your affection would cease
Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
one she loves
And have you
I have
Are they not lamely writ
No boy but as well as I can do them Peace
here she comes
Aside  O excellent motion O exceeding puppet
Now will he interpret to her
Enter SILVIA
Madam and mistress a thousand goodmorrows
Aside  O give ye good even heres a million of manners
Sir Valentine and servant to you two thousand
Aside  He should give her interest and she gives it him
As you enjoind me I have writ your letter
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
But for my duty to your ladyship
I thank you gentle servant tis very clerkly done
Now trust me madam it came hardly off
For being ignorant to whom it goes
I writ at random very doubtfully
Perchance you think too much of so much pains
No madam so it stead you I will write
Please you command a thousand times as much And yet
A pretty period Well I guess the sequel
And yet I will not name it and yet I care not
And yet take this again and yet I thank you
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more
Aside  And yet you will and yet another yet
What means your ladyship do you not like it
Yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ
But since unwillingly take them again
Nay take them
Madam they are for you
Ay ay you writ them sir at my request
But I will none of them they are for you
I would have had them writ more movingly
Please you Ill write your ladyship another
And when its writ for my sake read it over
And if it please you so if not why so
If it please me madam what then
Why if it please you take it for your labour
And so good morrow servant
Exit
O jest unseen inscrutable invisible
As a nose on a mans face or a weathercock on a steeple
My master sues to her and she hath
taught her suitor
He being her pupil to become her tutor
O excellent device was there ever heard a better
That my master being scribe to himself should write
the letter
How now sir what are you reasoning with yourself
Nay I was rhyming tis you that have the reason
To do what
To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia
To whom
To yourself why she wooes you by a figure
What figure
By a letter I should say
Why she hath not writ to me
What need she when she hath made you write to
yourself Why do you not perceive the jest
No believe me
No believing you indeed sir But did you perceive
her earnest
She gave me none except an angry word
Why she hath given you a letter
Thats the letter I writ to her friend
And that letter hath she delivered and there an end
I would it were no worse
Ill warrant you tis as well
For often have you writ to her and she in modesty
Or else for want of idle time could not again reply
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover
All this I speak in print for in print I found it
Why muse you sir tis dinnertime
I have dined
Ay but hearken sir though the chameleon Love can
feed on the air I am one that am nourished by my
victuals and would fain have meat O be not like
your mistress be moved be moved
Exeunt
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
Have patience gentle Julia
I must where is no remedy
When possibly I can I will return
If you turn not you will return the sooner
Keep this remembrance for thy Julias sake
Giving a ring
Why then well make exchange here take you this
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss
Here is my hand for my true constancy
And when that hour oerslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not Julia for thy sake
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my loves forgetfulness
My father stays my coming answer not
The tide is now nay not thy tide of tears
That tide will stay me longer than I should
Julia farewell
Exit JULIA

Mistress
Master Sir Thurio frowns on you
Ay boy its for love
Not of you
Of my mistress then
Twere good you knocked him
Exit
Servant you are sad
Indeed madam I seem so
Seem you that you are not
Haply I do
So do counterfeits
So do you
What seem I that I am not
Wise
What instance of the contrary
Your folly
And how quote you my folly
I quote it in your jerkin
My jerkin is a doublet
Well then Ill double your folly
How
What angry Sir Thurio do you change colour
Give him leave madam he is a kind of chameleon
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
in your air
You have said sir
Ay sir and done too for this time
I know it well sir you always end ere you begin
A fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off
Tis indeed madam we thank the giver
Who is that servant
Yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire Sir
Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyships looks
and spends what he borrows kindly in your company
Sir if you spend word for word with me I shall
make your wit bankrupt
I know it well sir you have an exchequer of words
and I think no other treasure to give your
followers for it appears by their bare liveries
that they live by your bare words
No more gentlemen no morehere comes my father
Enter DUKE
Now daughter Silvia you are hard beset
Sir Valentine your fathers in good health
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news
My lord I will be thankful
To any happy messenger from thence
Know ye Don Antonio your countryman
Ay my good lord I know the gentleman
To be of worth and worthy estimation
And not without desert so well reputed
Hath he not a son
Ay my good lord a son that well deserves
The honour and regard of such a father
You know him well
I know him as myself for from our infancy
We have conversed and spent our hours together
And though myself have been an idle truant
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
To clothe mine age with angellike perfection
Yet hath Sir Proteus for thats his name
Made use and fair advantage of his days
His years but young but his experience old
His head unmellowd but his judgment ripe
And in a word for far behind his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow
He is complete in feature and in mind
With all good grace to grace a gentleman
Beshrew me sir but if he make this good
He is as worthy for an empress love
As meet to be an emperors counsellor
Well sir this gentleman is come to me
With commendation from great potentates
And here he means to spend his time awhile
I think tis no unwelcome news to you
Should I have wishd a thing it had been he
Welcome him then according to his worth
Silvia I speak to you and you Sir Thurio
For Valentine I need not cite him to it
I will send him hither to you presently
Exit
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
Had come along with me but that his mistress
Did hold his eyes lockd in her crystal looks
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
Upon some other pawn for fealty
Nay sure I think she holds them prisoners still
Nay then he should be blind and being blind
How could he see his way to seek out you
Why lady Love hath twenty pair of eyes
They say that Love hath not an eye at all
To see such lovers Thurio as yourself
Upon a homely object Love can wink
Have done have done here comes the gentleman
Exit THURIO
Enter PROTEUS
Welcome dear Proteus Mistress I beseech you
Confirm his welcome with some special favour
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither
If this be he you oft have wishd to hear from
Mistress it is sweet lady entertain him
To be my fellowservant to your ladyship
Too low a mistress for so high a servant
Not so sweet  lady but too mean a servant
To have a look of such a worthy mistress
Leave off discourse of disability
Sweet lady entertain him for your servant
My duty will I boast of nothing else
And duty never yet did want his meed
Servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress
Ill die on him that says so but yourself
That you are welcome
That you are worthless
Reenter THURIO
Madam my lord your father would speak with you
I wait upon his pleasure Come Sir Thurio
Go with me Once more new servant welcome
Ill leave you to confer of home affairs
When you have done we look to hear from you
Well both attend upon your ladyship
Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
Now tell me how do all from whence you came
Your friends are well and have them much commended
And how do yours
I left them all in health
How does your lady and how thrives your love
My tales of love were wont to weary you
I know you joy not in a love discourse
Ay Proteus but that life is alterd now
I have done penance for contemning Love
Whose high imperious thoughts have punishd me
With bitter fasts with penitential groans
With nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs
For in revenge of my contempt of love
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
And made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow
O gentle Proteus Loves a mighty lord
And hath so humbled me as I confess
There is no woe to his correction
Nor to his service no such joy on earth
Now no discourse except it be of love
Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep
Upon the very naked name of love
Enough I read your fortune in your eye
Was this the idol that you worship so
Even she and is she not a heavenly saint
No but she is an earthly paragon
Call her divine
I will not flatter her
O flatter me for love delights in praises
When I was sick you gave me bitter pills
And I must minister the like to you
Then speak the truth by her if not divine
Yet let her be a principality
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth
Except my mistress
Sweet except not any
Except thou wilt except against my love
Have I not reason to prefer mine own
And I will help thee to prefer her too
She shall be dignified with this high honour
To bear my ladys train lest the base earth
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
And of so great a favour growing proud
Disdain to root the summerswelling flower
And make rough winter everlastingly
Why Valentine what braggardism is this
Pardon me Proteus all I can is nothing
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
She is alone
Then let her alone
Not for the world why man she is mine own
And I as rich in having such a jewel
As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee
Because thou seest me dote upon my love
My foolish rival that her father likes
Only for his possessions are so huge
Is gone with her along and I must after
For love thou knowst is full of jealousy
But she loves you
Ay and we are betrothd nay more our
marriagehour
With all the cunning manner of our flight
Determined of how I must climb her window
The ladder made of cords and all the means
Plotted and greed on for my happiness
Good Proteus go with me to my chamber
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
Go on before I shall inquire you forth
I must unto the road to disembark
Some necessaries that I needs must use
And then Ill presently attend you
Will you make haste
I will
Exit VALENTINE
Even as one heat another heat expels
Or as one nail by strength drives out another
So the remembrance of my former love
Is by a newer object quite forgotten
Is it mine or Valentines praise
Her true perfection or my false transgression
That makes me reasonless to reason thus
She is fair and so is Julia that I love
That I did love for now my love is thawd
Which like a waxen image gainst a fire
Bears no impression of the thing it was
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold
And that I love him not as I was wont
O but I love his lady too too much
And thats the reason I love him so little
How shall I dote on her with more advice
That thus without advice begin to love her
Tis but her picture I have yet beheld
And that hath dazzled my reasons light
But when I look on her perfections
There is no reason but I shall be blind
If I can cheque my erring love I will
If not to compass her Ill use my skill
Exit
Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
Launce by mine honesty welcome to Milan
Forswear not thyself sweet youth for I am not
welcome I reckon this always that a man is never
undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a
place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
say Welcome
Come on you madcap Ill to the alehouse with you
presently where for one shot of five pence thou
shalt have five thousand welcomes But sirrah how
did thy master part with Madam Julia
Marry after they closed in earnest they parted very
fairly in jest
But shall she marry him
No
How then shall he marry her
No neither
What are they broken
No they are both as whole as a fish
Why then how stands the matter with them
Marry thus when it stands well with him it
stands well with her
What an ass art thou I understand thee not
What a block art thou that thou canst not My
staff understands me
What thou sayest
Ay and what I do too look thee Ill but lean
and my staff understands me
It stands under thee indeed
Why standunder and understand is all one
But tell me true willt be a match
Ask my dog if he say ay it will if he say no
it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will
The conclusion is then that it will
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable
Tis well that I get it so But Launce how sayest
thou that my master is become a notable lover
I never knew him otherwise
Than how
A notable lubber as thou reportest him to be
Why thou whoreson ass thou mistakest me
Why fool I meant not thee I meant thy master
I tell thee my master is become a hot lover
Why I tell thee I care not though he burn himself
in love If thou wilt go with me to the alehouse
if not thou art an Hebrew a Jew and not worth the
name of a Christian
Why
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
go to the ale with a Christian Wilt thou go
At thy service
Exeunt
Enter PROTEUS
To leave my Julia shall I be forsworn
To love fair Silvia shall I be forsworn
To wrong my friend I shall be much forsworn
And even that power which gave me first my oath
Provokes me to this threefold perjury
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear
O sweetsuggesting Love if thou hast sinned
Teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
At first I did adore a twinkling star
But now I worship a celestial sun
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better
Fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferrd
With twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths
I cannot leave to love and yet I do
But there I leave to love where I should love
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose
If I keep them I needs must lose myself
If I lose them thus find I by their loss
For Valentine myself for Julia Silvia
I to myself am dearer than a friend
For love is still most precious in itself
And Silviawitness Heaven that made her fair
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope
I will forget that Julia is alive
Remembering that my love to her is dead
And Valentine Ill hold an enemy
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend
I cannot now prove constant to myself
Without some treachery used to Valentine
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvias chamberwindow
Myself in counsel his competitor
Now presently Ill give her father notice
Of their disguising and pretended flight
Who all enraged will banish Valentine
For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
But Valentine being gone Ill quickly cross
By some sly trick blunt Thurios dull proceeding
Love lend me wings to make my purpose swift
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift
Exit
Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
Counsel Lucetta gentle girl assist me
And even in kind love I do conjure thee
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
How with my honour I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus
Alas the way is wearisome and long
A truedevoted pilgrim is not weary
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
Much less shall she that hath Loves wings to fly
And when the flight is made to one so dear
Of such divine perfection as Sir Proteus
Better forbear till Proteus make return
O knowst thou not his looks are my souls food
Pity the dearth that I have pined in
By longing for that food so long a time
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
As seek to quench the fire of love with words
I do not seek to quench your loves hot fire
But qualify the fires extreme rage
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason
The more thou dammst it up the more it burns
The current that with gentle murmur glides
Thou knowst being stoppd impatiently doth rage
But when his fair course is not hindered
He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage
And so by many winding nooks he strays
With willing sport to the wild ocean
Then let me go and hinder not my course
Ill be as patient as a gentle stream
And make a pastime of each weary step
Till the last step have brought me to my love
And there Ill rest as after much turmoil
A blessed soul doth in Elysium
But in what habit will you go along
Not like a woman for I would prevent
The loose encounters of lascivious men
Gentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds
As may beseem some wellreputed page
Why then your ladyship must cut your hair
No girl Ill knit it up in silken strings
With twenty oddconceited truelove knots
To be fantastic may become a youth
Of greater time than I shall show to be
What fashion madam shall I make your breeches
That fits as well as Tell me good my lord
What compass will you wear your farthingale
Why even what fashion thou best likest Lucetta
You must needs have them with a codpiece madam
Out out Lucetta that would be illfavourd
A round hose madam nows not worth a pin
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
Lucetta as thou lovest me let me have
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly
But tell me wench how will the world repute me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey
I fear me it will make me scandalized
If you think so then stay at home and go not
Nay that I will not
Then never dream on infamy but go
If Proteus like your journey when you come
No matter whos displeased when you are gone
I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal
That is the least Lucetta of my fear
A thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
And instances of infinite of love
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus
All these are servants to deceitful men
Base men that use them to so base effect
But truer stars did govern Proteus birth
His words are bonds his oaths are oracles
His love sincere his thoughts immaculate
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him
Now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong
To bear a hard opinion of his truth
Only deserve my love by loving him
And presently go with me to my chamber
To take a note of what I stand in need of
To furnish me upon my longing journey
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose
My goods my lands my reputation
Only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
Come answer not but to it presently
I am impatient of my tarriance
Exeunt
Enter DUKE THURIO and PROTEUS
Sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile
We have some secrets to confer about
Exit THURIO
Now tell me Proteus whats your will with me
My gracious lord that which I would discover
The law of friendship bids me to conceal
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Done to me undeserving as I am
My duty pricks me on to utter that
Which else no worldly good should draw from me
Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend
This night intends to steal away your daughter
Myself am one made privy to the plot
I know you have determined to bestow her
On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
And should she thus be stoln away from you
It would be much vexation to your age
Thus for my dutys sake I rather chose
To cross my friend in his intended drift
Than by concealing it heap on your head
A pack of sorrows which would press you down
Being unprevented to your timeless grave
Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care
Which to requite command me while I live
This love of theirs myself have often seen
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man
A rashness that I ever yet have shunnd
I gave him gentle looks thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me
And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower
The key whereof myself have ever kept
And thence she cannot be conveyd away
Know noble lord they have devised a mean
How he her chamberwindow will ascend
And with a corded ladder fetch her down
For which the youthful lover now is gone
And this way comes he with it presently
Where if it please you you may intercept him
But good my Lord do it so cunningly
That my discovery be not aimed at
For love of you not hate unto my friend
Hath made me publisher of this pretence
Upon mine honour he shall never know
That I had any light from thee of this
Adieu my Lord Sir Valentine is coming
Exit
Enter VALENTINE
Sir Valentine whither away so fast
Please it your grace there is a messenger
That stays to bear my letters to my friends
And I am going to deliver them
Be they of much import
The tenor of them doth but signify
My health and happy being at your court
Nay then no matter stay with me awhile
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near wherein thou must be secret
Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter
I know it well my Lord and sure the match
Were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him
No trust me she is peevish sullen froward
Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
Neither regarding that she is my child
Nor fearing me as if I were her father
And may I say to thee this pride of hers
Upon advice hath drawn my love from her
And where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should have been cherishd by her childlike duty
I now am full resolved to take a wife
And turn her out to who will take her in
Then let her beauty be her weddingdower
For me and my possessions she esteems not
What would your Grace have me to do in this
There is a lady in Verona here
Whom I affect but she is nice and coy
And nought esteems my aged eloquence
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor
For long agone I have forgot to court
Besides the fashion of the time is changed
How and which way I may bestow myself
To be regarded in her sunbright eye
Win her with gifts if she respect not words
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
More than quick words do move a womans mind
But she did scorn a present that I sent her
A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her
Send her another never give her oer
For scorn at first makes afterlove the more
If she do frown tis not in hate of you
But rather to beget more love in you
If she do chide tis not to have you gone
For why the fools are mad if left alone
Take no repulse whatever she doth say
For get you gone she doth not mean away
Flatter and praise commend extol their graces
Though neer so black say they have angels faces
That man that hath a tongue I say is no man
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman
But she I mean is promised by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth
And kept severely from resort of men
That no man hath access by day to her
Why then I would resort to her by night
Ay but the doors be lockd and keys kept safe
That no man hath recourse to her by night
What lets but one may enter at her window
Her chamber is aloft far from the ground
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Without apparent hazard of his life
Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
Would serve to scale another Heros tower
So bold Leander would adventure it
Now as thou art a gentleman of blood
Advise me where I may have such a ladder
When would you use it pray sir tell me that
This very night for Love is like a child
That longs for every thing that he can come by
By seven oclock Ill get you such a ladder
But hark thee I will go to her alone
How shall I best convey the ladder thither
It will be light my lord that you may bear it
Under a cloak that is of any length
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
Ay my good lord
Then let me see thy cloak
Ill get me one of such another length
Why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak
I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
What letter is this same Whats here To Silvia
And here an engine fit for my proceeding
Ill be so bold to break the seal for once
Reads
My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly
And slaves they are to me that send them flying
O could their master come and go as lightly
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
While I their king that hither them importune
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blessd them
Because myself do want my servants fortune
I curse myself for they are sent by me
That they should harbour where their lord would be
Whats here
Silvia this night I will enfranchise thee
Tis so and heres the ladder for the purpose
Why Phaetonfor thou art Merops son
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world
Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
Go base intruder overweening slave
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
And think my patience more than thy desert
Is privilege for thy departure hence
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which all too much I have bestowd on thee
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court
By heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself
Be gone I will not hear thy vain excuse
But as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence
Exit
And why not death rather than living torment
To die is to be banishd from myself
And Silvia is myself banishd from her
Is self from self a deadly banishment
What light is light if Silvia be not seen
What joy is joy if Silvia be not by
Unless it be to think that she is by
And feed upon the shadow of perfection
Except I be by Silvia in the night
There is no music in the nightingale
Unless I look on Silvia in the day
There is no day for me to look upon
She is my essence and I leave to be
If I be not by her fair influence
Fosterd illumined cherishd kept alive
I fly not death to fly his deadly doom
Tarry I here I but attend on death
But fly I hence I fly away from life
Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
Run boy run run and seek him out
Soho soho
What seest thou
Him we go to find theres not a hair ons head
but tis a Valentine
Valentine
No
Who then his spirit
Neither
What then
Nothing
Can nothing speak Master shall I strike
Who wouldst thou strike
Nothing
Villain forbear
Why sir Ill strike nothing I pray you
Sirrah I say forbear Friend Valentine a word
My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news
So much of bad already hath possessd them
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine
For they are harsh untuneable and bad
Is Silvia dead
No Valentine
No Valentine indeed for sacred Silvia
Hath she forsworn me
No Valentine
No Valentine if Silvia have forsworn me
What is your news
Sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished
That thou art banishedO thats the news
From hence from Silvia and from me thy friend
O I have fed upon this woe already
And now excess of it will make me surfeit
Doth Silvia know that I am banished
Ay ay and she hath offerd to the doom
Which unreversed stands in effectual force
A sea of melting pearl which some call tears
Those at her fathers churlish feet she tenderd
With them upon her knees her humble self
Wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
As if but now they waxed pale for woe
But neither bended knees pure hands held up
Sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire
But Valentine if he be taen must die
Besides her intercession chafed him so
When she for thy repeal was suppliant
That to close prison he commanded her
With many bitter threats of biding there
No more unless the next word that thou speakst
Have some malignant power upon my life
If so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear
As ending anthem of my endless dolour
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help
And study help for that which thou lamentst
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good
Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
Besides thy staying will abridge thy life
Hope is a lovers staff walk hence with that
And manage it against despairing thoughts
Thy letters may be here though thou art hence
Which being writ to me shall be deliverd
Even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love
The time now serves not to expostulate
Come Ill convey thee through the citygate
And ere I part with thee confer at large
Of all that may concern thy loveaffairs
As thou lovest Silvia though not for thyself
Regard thy danger and along with me
I pray thee Launce an if thou seest my boy
Bid him make haste and meet me at the Northgate
Go sirrah find him out Come Valentine
O my dear Silvia Hapless Valentine
Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS
I am but a fool look you and yet I have the wit to
think my master is a kind of a knave but thats
all one if he be but one knave He lives not now
that knows me to be in love yet I am in love but a
team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who
tis I love and yet tis a woman but what woman I
will not tell myself and yet tis a milkmaid yet
tis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet tis
a maid for she is her masters maid and serves for
wages She hath more qualities than a waterspaniel
which is much in a bare Christian
Pulling out a paper
Here is the catelog of her condition

can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only
carry therefore is she better than a jade Item
She can milk look you a sweet virtue in a maid

Exit
Enter DUKE and THURIO
Sir Thurio fear not but that she will love you
Now Valentine is banishd from her sight
Since his exile she hath despised me most
Forsworn my company and raild at me
That I am desperate of obtaining her
This weak impress of love is as a figure
Trenched in ice which with an hours heat
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot
Enter PROTEUS
How now Sir Proteus Is your countryman
According to our proclamation gone
Gone my good lord
My daughter takes his going grievously
A little time my lord will kill that grief
So I believe but Thurio thinks not so
Proteus the good conceit I hold of thee
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert
Makes me the better to confer with thee
Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
Let me not live to look upon your grace
Thou knowst how willingly I would effect
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter
I do my lord
And also I think thou art not ignorant
How she opposes her against my will
She did my lord when Valentine was here
Ay and perversely she persevers so
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio
The best way is to slander Valentine
With falsehood cowardice and poor descent
Three things that women highly hold in hate
Ay but shell think that it is spoke in hate
Ay if his enemy deliver it
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend
Then you must undertake to slander him
And that my lord I shall be loath to do
Tis an ill office for a gentleman
Especially against his very friend
Where your good word cannot advantage him
Your slander never can endamage him
Therefore the office is indifferent
Being entreated to it by your friend
You have prevaild my lord if I can do it
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise
She shall not long continue love to him
But say this weed her love from Valentine
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio
Therefore as you unwind her love from him
Lest it should ravel and be good to none
You must provide to bottom it on me
Which must be done by praising me as much
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine
And Proteus we dare trust you in this kind
Because we know on Valentines report
You are already Loves firm votary
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind
Upon this warrant shall you have access
Where you with Silvia may confer at large
For she is lumpish heavy melancholy
And for your friends sake will be glad of you
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
To hate young Valentine and love my friend
As much as I can do I will effect
But you Sir Thurio are not sharp enough
You must lay lime to tangle her desires
By wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
Should be fullfraught with serviceable vows
Ay
Much is the force of heavenbred poesy
Say that upon the altar of her beauty
You sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
Write till your ink be dry and with your tears
Moist it again and frame some feeling line
That may discover such integrity
For Orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
After your direlamenting elegies
Visit by night your ladys chamberwindow
With some sweet concert to their instruments
Tune a deploring dump the nights dead silence
Will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance
This or else nothing will inherit her
This discipline shows thou hast been in love
Therefore sweet Proteus my directiongiver
Let us into the city presently
To sort some gentlemen well skilld in music
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
To give the onset to thy good advice
About it gentlemen
Well wait upon your grace till after supper
And afterward determine our proceedings
Even now about it I will pardon you
Exeunt
Enter certain Outlaws
Fellows stand fast I see a passenger
If there be ten shrink not but down with em
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
Stand sir and throw us that you have about ye
If not well make you sit and rifle you
Sir we are undone these are the villains
That all the travellers do fear so much
My friends
Thats not so sir we are your enemies
Peace well hear him
Ay by my beard will we for hes a proper man
Then know that I have little wealth to lose
A man I am crossd with adversity
My riches are these poor habiliments
Of which if you should here disfurnish me
You take the sum and substance that I have
Whither travel you
To Verona
Whence came you
From Milan
Have you long sojourned there
Some sixteen months and longer might have stayd
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me
What were you banishd thence
I was
For what offence
For that which now torments me to rehearse
I killd a man whose death I much repent
Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight
Without false vantage or base treachery
Why neer repent it if it were done so
But were you banishd for so small a fault
I was and held me glad of such a doom
Have you the tongues
My youthful travel therein made me happy
Or else I often had been miserable
By the bare scalp of Robin Hoods fat friar
Well have him Sirs a word
Master be one of them its an honourable kind of thievery
Peace villain
Tell us this have you any thing to take to
Nothing but my fortune
Know then that some of us are gentlemen
Such as the fury of ungovernd youth
Thrust from the company of awful men
Myself was from Verona banished
An heir and near allied unto the duke
And I from Mantua for a gentleman
Who in my mood I stabbd unto the heart
And I for such like petty crimes as these
But to the purposefor we cite our faults
That they may hold excusd our lawless lives
And partly seeing you are beautified
With goodly shape and by your own report
A linguist and a man of such perfection
As we do in our quality much want
Indeed because you are a banishd man
Therefore above the rest we parley to you
Are you content to be our general
To make a virtue of necessity
And live as we do in this wilderness
What sayst thou wilt thou be of our consort
Say ay and be the captain of us all
Well do thee homage and be ruled by thee
Love thee as our commander and our king
But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offerd
I take your offer and will live with you
Provided that you do no outrages
On silly women or poor passengers
Come go with us well bring thee to our crews
And show thee all the treasure we have got
Which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose
Exeunt
Enter PROTEUS
Already have I been false to Valentine
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio
Under the colour of commending him
I have access my own love to prefer
But Silvia is too fair too true too holy
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts
When I protest true loyalty to her
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend
When to her beauty I commend my vows
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips
The least whereof would quell a lovers hope
Yet spaniellike the more she spurns my love
The more it grows and fawneth on her still
But here comes Thurio now must we to her window
And give some evening music to her ear
Enter THURIO and Musicians
How now Sir Proteus are you crept before us
Ay gentle Thurio for you know that love
Will creep in service where it cannot go
Ay but I hope sir that you love not here
Sir but I do or else I would be hence
Who Silvia
Ay Silvia for your sake
I thank you for your own Now gentlemen
Lets tune and to it lustily awhile
Enter at a distance Host and JULIA in boys clothes
Now my young guest methinks youre allycholly I
pray you why is it
Marry mine host because I cannot be merry
Come well have you merry Ill bring you where
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for
But shall I hear him speak
Ay that you shall
That will be music
Music plays
Hark hark
Is he among these
Ay but peace lets hear em
SONG
Who is Silvia what is she
That all our swains commend her
Holy fair and wise is she
The heaven such grace did lend her
That she might admired be
Is she kind as she is fair
For beauty lives with kindness
Love doth to her eyes repair
To help him of his blindness
And being helpd inhabits there
Then to Silvia let us sing
That Silvia is excelling
She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling
To her let us garlands bring
How now are you sadder than you were before How
do you man the music likes you not
You mistake the musician likes me not
Why my pretty youth
He plays false father
How out of tune on the strings
Not so but yet so false that he grieves my very
heartstrings
You have a quick ear
Ay I would I were deaf it makes me have a slow heart
I perceive you delight not in music
Not a whit when it jars so
Hark what fine change is in the music
Ay that change is the spite
You would have them always play but one thing
I would always have one play but one thing
But host doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
Often resort unto this gentlewoman
I tell you what Launce his man told me he loved
her out of all nick
Where is Launce
Gone to seek his dog which tomorrow by his
masters command he must carry for a present to his lady
Peace stand aside the company parts
Sir Thurio fear not you I will so plead
That you shall say my cunning drift excels
Where meet we
At Saint Gregorys well
Farewell
Exeunt THURIO and Musicians
Enter SILVIA above
Madam good even to your ladyship
I thank you for your music gentlemen
Who is that that spake
One lady if you knew his pure hearts truth
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice
Sir Proteus as I take it
Sir Proteus gentle lady and your servant
Whats your will
That I may compass yours
You have your wish my will is even this
That presently you hie you home to bed
Thou subtle perjured false disloyal man
Thinkst thou I am so shallow so conceitless
To be seduced by thy flattery
That hast deceived so many with thy vows
Return return and make thy love amends
For me by this pale queen of night I swear
I am so far from granting thy request
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit
And by and by intend to chide myself
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee
I grant sweet love that I did love a lady
But she is dead
Aside        Twere false if I should speak it
For I am sure she is not buried
Say that she be yet Valentine thy friend
Survives to whom thyself art witness
I am betrothd and art thou not ashamed
To wrong him with thy importunacy
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead
And so suppose am I for in his grave
Assure thyself my love is buried
Sweet lady let me rake it from the earth
Go to thy ladys grave and call hers thence
Or at the least in hers sepulchre thine
Aside  He heard not that
Madam if your heart be so obdurate
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
The picture that is hanging in your chamber
To that Ill speak to that Ill sigh and weep
For since the substance of your perfect self
Is else devoted I am but a shadow
And to your shadow will I make true love
Aside  If twere a substance you would sure
deceive it
And make it but a shadow as I am
I am very loath to be your idol sir
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes
Send to me in the morning and Ill send it
And so good rest
As wretches have oernight
That wait for execution in the morn
Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally
Host will you go
By my halidom I was fast asleep
Pray you where lies Sir Proteus
Marry at my house Trust me I think tis almost
day
Not so but it hath been the longest night
That eer I watchd and the most heaviest
Exeunt
Enter EGLAMOUR
This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Entreated me to call and know her mind
Theres some great matter sheld employ me in
Madam madam
Enter SILVIA above
Who calls
Your servant and your friend
One that attends your ladyships command
Sir Eglamour a thousand times good morrow
As many worthy lady to yourself
According to your ladyships impose
I am thus early come to know what service
It is your pleasure to command me in
O Eglamour thou art a gentleman
Think not I flatter for I swear I do not
Valiant wise remorseful well accomplishd
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
I bear unto the banishd Valentine
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
Vain Thurio whom my very soul abhors
Thyself hast loved and I have heard thee say
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
As when thy lady and thy true love died
Upon whose grave thou vowdst pure chastity
Sir Eglamour I would to Valentine
To Mantua where I hear he makes abode
And for the ways are dangerous to pass
I do desire thy worthy company
Upon whose faith and honour I repose
Urge not my fathers anger Eglamour
But think upon my grief a ladys grief
And on the justice of my flying hence
To keep me from a most unholy match
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
I do desire thee even from a heart
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands
To bear me company and go with me
If not to hide what I have said to thee
That I may venture to depart alone
Madam I pity much your grievances
Which since I know they virtuously are placed
I give consent to go along with you
Recking as little what betideth me
As much I wish all good befortune you
When will you go
This evening coming
Where shall I meet you
At Friar Patricks cell
Where I intend holy confession
I will not fail your ladyship Good morrow gentle lady
Good morrow kind Sir Eglamour
Exeunt severally
Enter LAUNCE with his his Dog
When a mans servant shall play the cur with him
look you it goes hard one that I brought up of a
puppy one that I saved from drowning when three or
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it
I have taught him even as one would say precisely
thus I would teach a dog I was sent to deliver
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master
and I came no sooner into the diningchamber but he
steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg
O tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
in all companies I would have as one should say
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be
as it were a dog at all things If I had not had
more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did
I think verily he had been hanged fort sure as I
live he had suffered fort you shall judge He
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentlemanlike dogs under the dukes table he had
not been therebless the marka pissing while but
all the chamber smelt him Out with the dog says
one What cur is that says another Whip him
out says the third Hang him up says the duke
I having been acquainted with the smell before
knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that
whips the dogs Friend quoth I you mean to whip
the dog Ay marry do I quoth he You do him
the more wrong quoth I twas I did the thing you
wot of He makes me no more ado but whips me out
of the chamber How many masters would do this for
his servant Nay Ill be sworn I have sat in the
stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had
been executed I have stood on the pillory for geese
he hath killed otherwise he had suffered fort
Thou thinkest not of this now Nay I remember the
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Silvia did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
do when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
water against a gentlewomans farthingale didst
thou ever see me do such a trick
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
Sebastian is thy name I like thee well
And will employ thee in some service presently
In what you please Ill do what I can
I hope thou wilt
To LAUNCE
How now you whoreson peasant
Where have you been these two days loitering
Marry sir I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me
And what says she to my little jewel
Marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you
currish thanks is good enough for such a present
But she received my dog
No indeed did she not here have I brought him
back again
What didst thou offer her this from me
Ay sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by
the hangman boys in the marketplace and then I
offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of
yours and therefore the gift the greater
Go get thee hence and find my dog again
Or neer return again into my sight
Away I say stayst thou to vex me here
Exit LAUNCE
A slave that still an end turns me to shame
Sebastian I have entertained thee
Partly that I have need of such a youth
That can with some discretion do my business
For tis no trusting to yond foolish lout
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior
Which if my augury deceive me not
Witness good bringing up fortune and truth
Therefore know thou for this I entertain thee
Go presently and take this ring with thee
Deliver it to Madam Silvia
She loved me well deliverd it to me
It seems you loved not her to leave her token
She is dead belike
Not so I think she lives
Alas
Why dost thou cry alas
I cannot choose
But pity her
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her
Because methinks that she loved you as well
As you do love your lady Silvia
She dreams of him that has forgot her love
You dote on her that cares not for your love
Tis pity love should be so contrary
And thinking of it makes me cry alas
Well give her that ring and therewithal
This letter Thats her chamber Tell my lady
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture
Your message done hie home unto my chamber
Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary
Exit
How many women would do such a message
Alas poor Proteus thou hast entertaind
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
Alas poor fool why do I pity him
That with his very heart despiseth me
Because he loves her he despiseth me
Because I love him I must pity him
This ring I gave him when he parted from me
To bind him to remember my good will
And now am I unhappy messenger
To plead for that which I would not obtain
To carry that which I would have refused
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised
I am my masters trueconfirmed love
But cannot be true servant to my master
Unless I prove false traitor to myself
Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly
As heaven it knows I would not have him speed
Enter SILVIA attended
Gentlewoman good day I pray you be my mean
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia
What would you with her if that I be she
If you be she I do entreat your patience
To hear me speak the message I am sent on
From whom
From my master Sir Proteus madam
O he sends you for a picture
Ay madam
Ursula bring my picture here
Go give your master this tell him from me
One Julia that his changing thoughts forget
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow
Madam please you peruse this letter
Pardon me madam I have unadvised
Deliverd you a paper that I should not
This is the letter to your ladyship
I pray thee let me look on that again
It may not be good madam pardon me
There hold
I will not look upon your masters lines
I know they are stuffd with protestations
And full of newfound oaths which he will break
As easily as I do tear his paper
Madam he sends your ladyship this ring
The more shame for him that he sends it me
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure
Though his false finger have profaned the ring
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong
She thanks you
What sayst thou
I thank you madam that you tender her
Poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
Dost thou know her
Almost as well as I do know myself
To think upon her woes I do protest
That I have wept a hundred several times
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her
I think she doth and thats her cause of sorrow
Is she not passing fair
She hath been fairer madam than she is
When she did think my master loved her well
She in my judgment was as fair as you
But since she did neglect her lookingglass
And threw her sunexpelling mask away
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
And pinchd the lilytincture of her face
That now she is become as black as I
How tall was she
About my stature for at Pentecost
When all our pageants of delight were playd
Our youth got me to play the womans part
And I was trimmd in Madam Julias gown
Which served me as fit by all mens judgments
As if the garment had been made for me
Therefore I know she is about my height
And at that time I made her weep agood
For I did play a lamentable part
Madam twas Ariadne passioning
For Theseus perjury and unjust flight
That my poor mistress moved therewithal
Wept bitterly and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow
She is beholding to thee gentle youth
Alas poor lady desolate and left
I weep myself to think upon thy words
Here youth there is my purse I give thee this
For thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovest her
Farewell
Exit SILVIA with attendants
And she shall thank you fort if eer you know her
A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
I hope my masters suit will be but cold
Since she respects my mistress love so much
Alas how love can trifle with itself
Here is her picture let me see I think
If I had such a tire this face of mine
Were full as lovely as is this of hers
And yet the painter flatterd her a little
Unless I flatter with myself too much
Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
If that be all the difference in his love
Ill get me such a colourd periwig
Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
Ay but her foreheads low and mines as high
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respective in myself
If this fond Love were not a blinded god
Come shadow come and take this shadow up
For tis thy rival O thou senseless form
Thou shalt be worshippd kissd loved and adored
And were there sense in his idolatry
My substance should be statue in thy stead
Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake
That used me so or else by Jove I vow
I should have scratchd out your unseeing eyes
To make my master out of love with thee
Exit
Enter EGLAMOUR
The sun begins to gild the western sky
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia at Friar Patricks cell should meet me
She will not fail for lovers break not hours
Unless it be to come before their time
So much they spur their expedition
See where she comes
Enter SILVIA
Lady a happy evening
Amen amen Go on good Eglamour
Out at the postern by the abbeywall
I fear I am attended by some spies
Fear not the forest is not three leagues off
If we recover that we are sure enough
Exeunt
Enter THURIO PROTEUS and JULIA
Sir Proteus what says Silvia to my suit
O sir I find her milder than she was
And yet she takes exceptions at your person
What that my leg is too long
No that it is too little
Ill wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder
Aside  But love will not be spurrd to what
it loathes
What says she to my face
She says it is a fair one
Nay then the wanton lies my face is black
But pearls are fair and the old saying is
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes
Aside  Tis true such pearls as put out
ladies eyes
For I had rather wink than look on them
How likes she my discourse
Ill when you talk of war
But well when I discourse of love and peace
Aside  But better indeed when you hold your peace
What says she to my valour
O sir she makes no doubt of that
Aside  She needs not when she knows it cowardice
What says she to my birth
That you are well derived
Aside  True from a gentleman to a fool
Considers she my possessions
O ay and pities them
Wherefore
Aside  That such an ass should owe them
That they are out by lease
Here comes the duke
Enter DUKE
How now Sir Proteus how now Thurio
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late
Not I
Nor I
Saw you my daughter
Neither
Why then
Shes fled unto that peasant Valentine
And Eglamour is in her company
Tis true for Friar Laurence met them both
As he in penance wanderd through the forest
Him he knew well and guessd that it was she
But being maskd he was not sure of it
Besides she did intend confession
At Patricks cell this even and there she was not
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountainfoot
That leads towards Mantua whither they are fled
Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me
Exit
Why this it is to be a peevish girl
That flies her fortune when it follows her
Ill after more to be revenged on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Silvia
Exit
And I will follow more for Silvias love
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her
Exit
And I will follow more to cross that love
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love
Exit
Enter Outlaws with SILVIA
Come come
Be patient we must bring you to our captain
A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learnd me how to brook this patiently
Come bring her away
Where is the gentleman that was with her
Being nimblefooted he hath outrun us
But Moyses and Valerius follow him
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood
There is our captain well follow him thats fled
The thicket is beset he cannot scape
Come I must bring you to our captains cave
Fear not he bears an honourable mind
And will not use a woman lawlessly
O Valentine this I endure for thee
Exeunt
Enter VALENTINE
How use doth breed a habit in a man
This shadowy desert unfrequented woods
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns
Here can I sit alone unseen of any
And to the nightingales complaining notes
Tune my distresses and record my woes
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless
Lest growing ruinous the building fall
And leave no memory of what it was
Repair me with thy presence Silvia
Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain
What halloing and what stir is this today
These are my mates that make their wills their law
Have some unhappy passenger in chase
They love me well yet I have much to do
To keep them from uncivil outrages
Withdraw thee Valentine whos this comes here
Enter PROTEUS SILVIA and JULIA
Madam this service I have done for you
Though you respect not aught your servant doth
To hazard life and rescue you from him
That would have forced your honour and your love
Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
And less than this I am sure you cannot give
Aside  How like a dream is this I see and hear
Love lend me patience to forbear awhile
O miserable unhappy that I am
Unhappy were you madam ere I came
But by my coming I have made you happy
By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy
Aside  And me when he approacheth to your presence
Had I been seized by a hungry lion
I would have been a breakfast to the beast
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me
O Heaven be judge how I love Valentine
Whose lifes as tender to me as my soul
And full as much for more there cannot be
I do detest false perjured Proteus
Therefore be gone solicit me no more
Would I not undergo for one calm look
O tis the curse in love and still approved
When women cannot love where theyre beloved
When Proteus cannot love where hes beloved
Read over Julias heart thy first best love
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
Descended into perjury to love me
Thou hast no faith left now unless thoudst two
And thats far worse than none better have none
Than plural faith which is too much by one
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend
In love
Who respects friend
All men but Proteus
Nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
Can no way change you to a milder form
Ill woo you like a soldier at arms end
And love you gainst the nature of loveforce ye
O heaven
Ill force thee yield to my desire
Ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
Thou friend of an ill fashion
Valentine
Thou common friend thats without faith or love
For such is a friend now treacherous man
Thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye
Could have persuaded me now I dare not say
I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
Who should be trusted when ones own right hand
Is perjured to the bosom Proteus
I am sorry I must never trust thee more
But count the world a stranger for thy sake
The private wound is deepest O time most accurst
Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
My shame and guilt confounds me
Forgive me Valentine if hearty sorrow
Be a sufficient ransom for offence
I tender t here I do as truly suffer
As eer I did commit
Then I am paid
And once again I do receive thee honest
Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased
By penitence the Eternals wraths appeased
And that my love may appear plain and free
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee
O me unhappy
Swoons
Look to the boy
Why boy why wag how now whats the matter
Look up speak
O good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring
to Madam Silvia which out of my neglect was never done
Where is that ring boy
Here tis this is it
How let me see
Why this is the ring I gave to Julia
O cry you mercy sir I have mistook
This is the ring you sent to Silvia
But how camest thou by this ring At my depart
I gave this unto Julia
And Julia herself did give it me
And Julia herself hath brought it hither
How Julia
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
And entertaind em deeply in her heart
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
O Proteus let this habit make thee blush
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Such an immodest raiment if shame live
In a disguise of love
It is the lesser blot modesty finds
Women to change their shapes than men their minds
Than men their minds tis true
O heaven were man
But constant he were perfect That one error
Fills him with faults makes him run through all the sins
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins
What is in Silvias face but I may spy
More fresh in Julias with a constant eye
Come come a hand from either
Let me be blest to make this happy close
Twere pity two such friends should be long foes
Bear witness Heaven I have my wish for ever
And I mine
Enter Outlaws with DUKE and THURIO
A prize a prize a prize
Forbear forbear I say it is my lord the duke
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced
Banished Valentine
Sir Valentine
Yonder is Silvia and Silvias mine
Thurio give back or else embrace thy death
Come not within the measure of my wrath
Do not name Silvia thine if once again
Verona shall not hold thee Here she stands
Take but possession of her with a touch
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love
Sir Valentine I care not for her I
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
His body for a girl that loves him not
I claim her not and therefore she is thine
The more degenerate and base art thou
To make such means for her as thou hast done
And leave her on such slight conditions
Now by the honour of my ancestry
I do applaud thy spirit Valentine
And think thee worthy of an empress love
Know then I here forget all former griefs
Cancel all grudge repeal thee home again
Plead a new state in thy unrivalld merit
To which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine
Thou art a gentleman and well derived
Take thou thy Silvia for thou hast deserved her
I thank your grace the gift hath made me happy
I now beseech you for your daughters sake
To grant one boom that I shall ask of you
I grant it for thine own whateer it be
These banishd men that I have kept withal
Are men endued with worthy qualities
Forgive them what they have committed here
And let them be recalld from their exile
They are reformed civil full of good
And fit for great employment worthy lord
Thou hast prevaild I pardon them and thee
Dispose of them as thou knowst their deserts
Come let us go we will include all jars
With triumphs mirth and rare solemnity
And as we walk along I dare be bold
With our discourse to make your grace to smile
What think you of this page my lord
I think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
I warrant you my lord more grace than boy
What mean you by that saying
Please you Ill tell you as we pass along
That you will wonder what hath fortuned
Come Proteus tis your penance but to hear
The story of your loves discovered
That done our day of marriage shall be yours
One feast one house one mutual happiness
Exeunt
Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS
If you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot you shall see as I have said great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia
I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves for indeed
Beseech you
Verily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge
we cannot with such magnificencein so rareI know
not what to say We will give you sleepy drinks
that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience
may though they cannot praise us as little accuse
us
You pay a great deal too dear for whats given freely
Believe me I speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia
They were trained together in their childhoods and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
which cannot choose but branch now Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society their encounters
though not personal have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts letters loving
embassies that they have seemed to be together
though absent shook hands as over a vast and
embraced as it were from the ends of opposed
winds The heavens continue their loves
I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him it
is a gallant child one that indeed physics the
subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man
Would they else be content to die
Yes if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live
If the king had no son they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one
Exeunt
Enter LEONTES HERMIONE MAMILLIUS POLIXENES CAMILLO and Attendants
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherds note since we have left our throne
Without a burthen time as long again
Would be find up my brother with our thanks
And yet we should for perpetuity
Go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher
Yet standing in rich place I multiply
With one We thank you many thousands moe
That go before it
Stay your thanks a while
And pay them when you part
Sir thats tomorrow
I am questiond by my fears of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence that may blow
No sneaping winds at home to make us say
This is put forth too truly besides I have stayd
To tire your royalty
We are tougher brother
Than you can put us tot
No longer stay
One sevennight longer
Very sooth tomorrow
Well part the time betweens then and in that
Ill no gainsaying
Press me not beseech you so
There is no tongue that moves none none i the world
So soon as yours could win me so it should now
Were there necessity in your request although
Twere needful I denied it My affairs
Do even drag me homeward which to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me my stay
To you a charge and trouble to save both
Farewell our brother
Tonguetied our queen
speak you
I had thought sir to have held my peace until
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay You sir
Charge him too coldly Tell him you are sure
The bygone day proclaimd say this to him
Hes beat from his best ward
Well said Hermione
To tell he longs to see his son were strong
But let him say so then and let him go
But let him swear so and he shall not stay
Well thwack him hence with distaffs
Yet of your royal presence Ill adventure
The borrow of a week When at Bohemia
You take my lord Ill give him my commission
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefixd fors parting yet good deed Leontes
I love thee not a jar o the clock behind
What ladyshe her lord Youll stay
No madam
Nay but you will
I may not verily
Verily
You put me off with limber vows but I
Though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths
Should yet say Sir no going Verily
You shall not go a ladys Verily s
As potent as a lords Will you go yet
Force me to keep you as a prisoner
Not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
When you depart and save your thanks How say you
My prisoner or my guest by your dread Verily
One of them you shall be
Your guest then madam
To be your prisoner should import offending
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish
Not your gaoler then
But your kind hostess Come Ill question you
Of my lords tricks and yours when you were boys
You were pretty lordings then
We were fair queen
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day tomorrow as today
And to be boy eternal
Was not my lord
The verier wag o the two
We were as twinnd lambs that did frisk i the sun
And bleat the one at the other what we changed
Was innocence for innocence we knew not
The doctrine of illdoing nor dreamd
That any did Had we pursued that life
And our weak spirits neer been higher reard
With stronger blood we should have answerd heaven
Boldly not guilty the imposition cleard
Hereditary ours
By this we gather
You have trippd since
O my most sacred lady
Temptations have since then been born tos for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl
Your precious self had then not crossd the eyes
Of my young playfellow
Grace to boot
Of this make no conclusion lest you say
Your queen and I are devils yet go on
The offences we have made you do well answer
If you first sinnd with us and that with us
You did continue fault and that you slippd not
With any but with us
Is he won yet
Hell stay my lord
At my request he would not
Hermione my dearest thou never spokest
To better purpose
Never
Never but once
What have I twice said well when wast before
I prithee tell me crams with praise and makes
As fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
Our praises are our wages you may rides
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre But to the goal
My last good deed was to entreat his stay
What was my first it has an elder sister
Or I mistake you O would her name were Grace
But once before I spoke to the purpose when
Nay let me havet I long
Why that was when
Three crabbed months had sourd themselves to death
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
I am yours for ever
Tis grace indeed
Why lo you now I have spoke to the purpose twice
The one for ever earnd a royal husband
The other for some while a friend
AsideToo hot too hot
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
I have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
But not for joy not joy This entertainment
May a free face put on derive a liberty
From heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
And well become the agent t may I grant
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
As in a lookingglass and then to sigh as twere
The mort o the deer O that is entertainment
My bosom likes not nor my brows Mamillius
Art thou my boy
Ay my good lord
I fecks
Why thats my bawcock What hast
smutchd thy nose
They say it is a copy out of mine Come captain
We must be neat not neat but cleanly captain
And yet the steer the heifer and the calf
Are all calld neatStill virginalling
Upon his palmHow now you wanton calf
Art thou my calf
Yes if you will my lord
Thou wantst a rough pash and the shoots that I have
To be full like me yet they say we are
Almost as like as eggs women say so
That will say anything but were they false
As oerdyed blacks as wind as waters false
As dice are to be wishd by one that fixes
No bourn twixt his and mine yet were it true
To say this boy were like me Come sir page
Look on me with your welkin eye sweet villain
Most dearst my collop Can thy dammayt be
Affection thy intention stabs the centre
Thou dost make possible things not so held
Communicatest with dreamshow can this be
And fellowst nothing then tis very credent
Thou mayst cojoin with something and thou dost
And that beyond commission and I find it
And that to the infection of my brains
And hardening of my brows
What means Sicilia
He something seems unsettled
How my lord
What cheer how ist with you best brother
Are you moved my lord
No in good earnest
How sometimes nature will betray its folly
Its tenderness and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms Looking on the lines
Of my boys face methoughts I did recoil
Twentythree years and saw myself unbreechd
In my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled
Lest it should bite its master and so prove
As ornaments oft do too dangerous
How like methought I then was to this kernel
This squash this gentleman Mine honest friend
Will you take eggs for money
No my lord Ill fight
You will why happy man bes dole My brother
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours
If at home sir
Hes all my exercise my mirth my matter
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
My parasite my soldier statesman all
He makes a Julys day short as December
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood
So stands this squire
Officed with me we two will walk my lord
And leave you to your graver steps Hermione
How thou lovest us show in our brothers welcome
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap
Next to thyself and my young rover hes
Apparent to my heart
If you would seek us
We are yours i the garden shalls attend you there
To your own bents dispose you youll be found
Be you beneath the sky
Aside
I am angling now
Though you perceive me not how I give line
Go to go to
How she holds up the neb the bill to him
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband
Exeunt POLIXENES HERMIONE and Attendants
Gone already
Inchthick kneedeep oer head and
ears a forkd one
Go play boy play thy mother plays and I
Play too but so disgraced a part whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour
Will be my knell Go play boy play
There have been
Or I am much deceived cuckolds ere now
And many a man there is even at this present
Now while I speak this holds his wife by the arm
That little thinks she has been sluiced ins absence
And his pond fishd by his next neighbour by
Sir Smile his neighbour nay theres comfort int
Whiles other men have gates and those gates opend
As mine against their will Should all despair
That have revolted wives the tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves Physic fort there is none
It is a bawdy planet that will strike
Where tis predominant and tis powerful think it
From east west north and south be it concluded
No barricado for a belly knowt
It will let in and out the enemy
With bag and baggage many thousand ons
Have the disease and feelt not How now boy
I am like you they say
Why thats some comfort What Camillo there
Ay my good lord
Go play Mamillius thourt an honest man
Exit MAMILLIUS
Camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
You had much ado to make his anchor hold
When you cast out it still came home
Didst note it
He would not stay at your petitions made
His business more material
Didst perceive it
Aside
Theyre here with me already whispering rounding
Sicilia is a soforth tis far gone
When I shall gust it last How camet Camillo
That he did stay
At the good queens entreaty
At the queens bet good should be pertinent
But so it is it is not Was this taken
By any understanding pate but thine
For thy conceit is soaking will draw in
More than the common blocks not noted ist
But of the finer natures by some severals
Of headpiece extraordinary lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind say
Business my lord I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer
Ha
Stays here longer
Ay but why
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress
Satisfy
The entreaties of your mistress satisfy
Let that suffice I have trusted thee Camillo
With all the nearest things to my heart as well
My chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou
Hast cleansed my bosom I from thee departed
Thy penitent reformd but we have been
Deceived in thy integrity deceived
In that which seems so
Be it forbid my lord
To bide upont thou art not honest or
If thou inclinest that way thou art a coward
Which hoxes honesty behind restraining
From course required or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent or else a fool
That seest a game playd home the rich stake drawn
And takest it all for jest
My gracious lord
I may be negligent foolish and fearful
In every one of these no man is free
But that his negligence his folly fear
Among the infinite doings of the world
Sometime puts forth In your affairs my lord
If ever I were wilfulnegligent
It was my folly if industriously
I playd the fool it was my negligence
Not weighing well the end if ever fearful
To do a thing where I the issue doubted
Where of the execution did cry out
Against the nonperformance twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest these my lord
Are such allowd infirmities that honesty
Is never free of But beseech your grace
Be plainer with me let me know my trespass
By its own visage if I then deny it
Tis none of mine
Ha not you seen Camillo
But thats past doubt you have or your eyeglass
Is thicker than a cuckolds hornor heard
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be muteor thoughtfor cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think
My wife is slippery If thou wilt confess
Or else be impudently negative
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
My wifes a hobbyhorse deserves a name
As rank as any flaxwench that puts to
Before her trothplight sayt and justifyt
I would not be a standerby to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so without
My present vengeance taken shrew my heart
You never spoke what did become you less
Than this which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that though true
Is whispering nothing
Is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses
Kissing with inside lip stopping the career
Of laughing with a sigha note infallible
Of breaking honestyhorsing foot on foot
Skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
Hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
That would unseen be wicked is this nothing
Why then the world and all thats int is nothing
The covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothing
My wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
If this be nothing
Good my lord be cured
Of this diseased opinion and betimes
For tis most dangerous
Say it be tis true
No no my lord
It is you lie you lie
I say thou liest Camillo and I hate thee
Pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
Or else a hovering temporizer that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
Inclining to them both were my wifes liver
Infected as her life she would not live
The running of one glass
Who does infect her
Why he that wears her like a medal hanging
About his neck Bohemia who if I
Had servants true about me that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour as their profits
Their own particular thrifts they would do that
Which should undo more doing ay and thou
His cupbearerwhom I from meaner form
Have benched and reared to worship who mayst see
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
How I am galledmightst bespice a cup
To give mine enemy a lasting wink
Which draught to me were cordial
Sir my lord
I could do this and that with no rash potion
But with a lingering dram that should not work
Maliciously like poison but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
So sovereignly being honourable
I have loved thee
Make that thy question and go rot
Dost think I am so muddy so unsettled
To appoint myself in this vexation sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets
Which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
Is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
Give scandal to the blood o the prince my son
Who I do think is mine and love as mine
Without ripe moving tot Would I do this
Could man so blench
I must believe you sir
I do and will fetch off Bohemia fort
Provided that when hes removed your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first
Even for your sons sake and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down
Ill give no blemish to her honour none
My lord
Go then and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia
And with your queen I am his cupbearer
If from me he have wholesome beverage
Account me not your servant
This is all
Dot and thou hast the one half of my heart
Dot not thou splitst thine own
Ill dot my lord
I will seem friendly as thou hast advised me
Exit
O miserable lady But for me
What case stand I in I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes and my ground to dot
Is the obedience to a master one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too To do this deed
Promotion follows If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourishd after Ild not dot but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
Let villany itself forsweart I must
Forsake the court to dot or no is certain
To me a breakneck Happy star reign now
Here comes Bohemia
Reenter POLIXENES
This is strange methinks
My favour here begins to warp Not speak
Good day Camillo
Hail most royal sir
What is the news i the court
None rare my lord
The king hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself even now I met him
With customary compliment when he
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
A lip of much contempt speeds from me and
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changeth thus his manners
I dare not know my lord
How dare not do not Do you know and dare not
Be intelligent to me tis thereabouts
For to yourself what you do know you must
And cannot say you dare not Good Camillo
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed too for I must be
A party in this alteration finding
Myself thus alterd with t
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper but
I cannot name the disease and it is caught
Of you that yet are well
How caught of me
Make me not sighted like the basilisk
I have lookd on thousands who have sped the better
By my regard but killd none so Camillo
As you are certainly a gentleman thereto
Clerklike experienced which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents noble names
In whose success we are gentleI beseech you
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
Thereof to be informd imprisont not
In ignorant concealment
I may not answer
A sickness caught of me and yet I well
I must be answerd Dost thou hear Camillo
I conjure thee by all the parts of man
Which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
Is not this suit of mine that thou declare
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping toward me how far off how near
Which way to be prevented if to be
If not how best to bear it
Sir I will tell you
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable therefore mark my counsel
Which must be even as swiftly followd as
I mean to utter it or both yourself and me
Cry lost and so good night
On good Camillo
I am appointed him to murder you
By whom Camillo
By the king
For what
He thinks nay with all confidence he swears
As he had seent or been an instrument
To vice you tot that you have touchd his queen
Forbiddenly
O then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Where I arrive and my approach be shunnd
Nay hated too worse than the greatst infection
That eer was heard or read
Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body
How should this grow
I know not but I am sure tis safer to
Avoid whats grown than question how tis born
If therefore you dare trust my honesty
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawnd away tonight
Your followers I will whisper to the business
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear them o the city For myself Ill put
My fortunes to your service which are here
By this discovery lost Be not uncertain
For by the honour of my parents I
Have utterd truth which if you seek to prove
I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
Than one condemnd by the kings own mouth thereon
His execution sworn
I do believe thee
I saw his heart in s face Give me thy hand
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago This jealousy
Is for a precious creature as shes rare
Must it be great and as his persons mighty
Must it be violent and as he does conceive
He is dishonourd by a man which ever
Professd to him why his revenges must
In that be made more bitter Fear oershades me
Good expedition be my friend and comfort
The gracious queen part of his theme but nothing
Of his illtaen suspicion Come Camillo
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bearst my life off hence let us avoid
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns please your highness
To take the urgent hour Come sir away
Exeunt
Enter HERMIONE MAMILLIUS and Ladies
Take the boy to you he so troubles me
Tis past enduring
Come my gracious lord
Shall I be your playfellow
No Ill none of you
Why my sweet lord
Youll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still I love you better
And why so my lord
Not for because
Your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
Become some women best so that there be not
Too much hair there but in a semicircle
Or a halfmoon made with a pen
Who taught you this
I learnt it out of womens faces Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows
Blue my lord
Nay thats a mock I have seen a ladys nose
That has been blue but not her eyebrows
Hark ye
The queen your mother rounds apace we shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days and then yould wanton with us
If we would have you
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk good time encounter her
What wisdom stirs amongst you Come sir now
I am for you again pray you sit by us
And tell s a tale
Merry or sad shallt be
As merry as you will
A sad tales best for winter I have one
Of sprites and goblins
Lets have that good sir
Come on sit down come on and do your best
To fright me with your sprites youre powerful at it
There was a man
Nay come sit down then on
Dwelt by a churchyard I will tell it softly
Yond crickets shall not hear it
Come on then
And givet me in mine ear
Enter LEONTES with ANTIGONUS Lords and others
Was he met there his train Camillo with him
Behind the tuft of pines I met them never
Saw I men scour so on their way I eyed them
Even to their ships
How blest am I
In my just censure in my true opinion
Alack for lesser knowledge how accursed
In being so blest There may be in the cup
A spider steepd and one may drink depart
And yet partake no venom for his knowledge
Is not infected but if one present
The abhorrd ingredient to his eye make known
How he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
With violent hefts I have drunk
and seen the spider
Camillo was his help in this his pander
There is a plot against my life my crown
Alls true that is mistrusted that false villain
Whom I employd was preemployd by him
He has discoverd my design and I
Remain a pinchd thing yea a very trick
For them to play at will How came the posterns
So easily open
By his great authority
Which often hath no less prevaild than so
On your command
I knowt too well
Give me the boy I am glad you did not nurse him
Though he does bear some signs of me yet you
Have too much blood in him
What is this sport
Bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
Away with him and let her sport herself
With that shes big with for tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus
But Ild say he had not
And Ill be sworn you would believe my saying
Howeer you lean to the nayward
You my lords
Look on her mark her well be but about
To say she is a goodly lady and
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
Tis pity shes not honest honourable
Praise her but for this her withoutdoor form
Which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
The shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
That calumny doth useO I am out
That mercy does for calumny will sear
Virtue itself these shrugs these hums and has
When you have said shes goodly come between
Ere you can say shes honest but be t known
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be
Shes an adulteress
Should a villain say so
The most replenishd villain in the world
He were as much more villain you my lord
Do but mistake
You have mistook my lady
Polixenes for Leontes O thou thing
Which Ill not call a creature of thy place
Lest barbarism making me the precedent
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar I have said
Shes an adulteress I have said with whom
More shes a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal that shes
A bedswerver even as bad as those
That vulgars give boldst titles ay and privy
To this their late escape
No by my life
Privy to none of this How will this grieve you
When you shall come to clearer knowledge that
You thus have publishd me Gentle my lord
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake
No if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon
The centre is not big enough to bear
A schoolboys top Away with her to prison
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks
Theres some ill planet reigns
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable Good my lords
I am not prone to weeping as our sex
Commonly are the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you measure me and so
The kings will be performd
Shall I be heard
Who ist that goes with me Beseech your highness
My women may be with me for you see
My plight requires it Do not weep good fools
There is no cause when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison then abound in tears
Is for my better grace Adieu my lord
I never wishd to see you sorry now
I trust I shall My women come you have leave
Go do our bidding hence
Exit HERMIONE guarded with Ladies
Beseech your highness call the queen again
Be certain what you do sir lest your justice
Prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
Yourself your queen your son
For her my lord
I dare my life lay down and will dot sir
Please you to accept it that the queen is spotless
I the eyes of heaven and to you I mean
In this which you accuse her
If it prove
Shes otherwise Ill keep my stables where
I lodge my wife Ill go in couples with her
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her
For every inch of woman in the world
Ay every dram of womans flesh is false If she be
Hold your peaces
Good my lord
It is for you we speak not for ourselves
You are abused and by some putteron
That will be damnd fort would I knew the villain
I would landdamn him Be she honourflawd
I have three daughters the eldest is eleven
The second and the third nine and some five
If this prove true theyll pay fort
by mine honour
Ill geld em all fourteen they shall not see
To bring false generations they are coheirs
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue
Cease no more
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead mans nose but I do seet and feelt
As you feel doing thus and see withal
The instruments that feel
If it be so
We need no grave to bury honesty
Theres not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth
What lack I credit
I had rather you did lack than I my lord
Upon this ground and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion
Be blamed fort how you might
Why what need we
Commune with you of this but rather follow
Our forceful instigation Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
Imparts this which if you or stupefied
Or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice the matter
The loss the gain the ordering ont is all
Properly ours
And I wish my liege
You had only in your silent judgment tried it
Without more overture
How could that be
Either thou art most ignorant by age
Or thou wert born a fool Camillos flight
Added to their familiarity
Which was as gross as ever touchd conjecture
That lackd sight only nought for approbation
But only seeing all other circumstances
Made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding
Yet for a greater confirmation
Most piteous to be wild I have dispatchd in post
To sacred Delphos to Apollos temple
Cleomenes and Dion whom you know
Of stuffd sufficiency now from the oracle
They will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
Shall stop or spur me Have I done well
Well done my lord
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform Come follow us
We are to speak in public for this business
Will raise us all
Aside
To laughter as I take it
If the good truth were known

Reenter Gaoler with EMILIA
Dear gentlewoman
How fares our gracious lady

May hold together on her frights and griefs
Which never tender lady hath born greater
She is something before her time deliverd
A boy
A daughter and a goodly babe
Lusty and like to live the queen receives
Much comfort int says My poor prisoner
I am innocent as you
I dare be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i the king

Becomes a woman best Ill taket upon me

And never to my redlookd anger be
The trumpet any more Pray you Emilia
Commend my best obedience to the queen
If she dares trust me with her little babe
Ill showt the king and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loudst We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o the child
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails
Most worthy madam
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue there is no lady living
So meet for this great errand Please your ladyship
To visit the next room Ill presently
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer

The anger of the king nor guilty of

Do not you fear upon mine honour

And level of my brain plotproof but she
I can hook to me say that she were gone
Given to the fire a moiety of my rest
Might come to me again Whos there
My lord
How does the boy
He took good rest tonight
Tis hoped his sickness is discharged
To see his nobleness
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother
He straight declined droopd took it deeply
Fastend and fixd the shame ont in himself
Threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
And downright languishd Leave me solely go
See how he fares
Exit Servant
Fie fie no thought of him
The thought of my revenges that way
Recoil upon me in himself too mighty
And in his parties his alliance let him be
Until a time may serve for present vengeance
Take it on her Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
They should not laugh if I could reach them nor
Shall she within my power
Enter PAULINA with a child
You must not enter
Nay rather good my lords be second to me
Fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
Than the queens life a gracious innocent soul
More free than he is jealous
Thats enough
Madam he hath not slept tonight commanded
None should come at him
Not so hot good sir
I come to bring him sleep Tis such as you
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking I
Do come with words as medicinal as true
Honest as either to purge him of that humour
That presses him from sleep
What noise there ho
No noise my lord but needful conference
About some gossips for your highness
How
Away with that audacious lady Antigonus
I charged thee that she should not come about me
I knew she would
I told her so my lord
On your displeasures peril and on mine
She should not visit you
What canst not rule her
From all dishonesty he can in this
Unless he take the course that you have done
Commit me for committing honour trust it
He shall not rule me
La you now you hear
When she will take the rein I let her run
But shell not stumble
Good my liege I come
And I beseech you hear me who profess
Myself your loyal servant your physician
Your most obedient counsellor yet that dare
Less appear so in comforting your evils
Than such as most seem yours I say I come
From your good queen
Good queen
Good queen my lord
Good queen I say good queen
And would by combat make her good so were I
A man the worst about you
Force her hence
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me on mine own accord Ill off
But first Ill do my errand The good queen
For she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
Here tis commends it to your blessing
Laying down the child
Out
A mankind witch Hence with her out o door
A most intelligencing bawd
Not so
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me and no less honest
Than you are mad which is enough Ill warrant
As this world goes to pass for honest
Traitors
Will you not push her out Give her the bastard
Thou dotard thou art womantired unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here Take up the bastard
Taket up I say givet to thy crone
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upont
He dreads his wife
So I would you did then twere past all doubt
Yould call your children yours
A nest of traitors
I am none by this good light
Nor I nor any
But one thats here and thats himself for he
The sacred honour of himself his queens
His hopeful sons his babes betrays to slander
Whose sting is sharper than the swords
and will not
For as the case now stands it is a curse
He cannot be compelld totonce remove
The root of his opinion which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound
A callat
Of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
And now baits me This brat is none of mine
It is the issue of Polixenes
Hence with it and together with the dam
Commit them to the fire
It is yours
And might we lay the old proverb to your charge
So like you tis the worse Behold my lords
Although the print be little the whole matter
And copy of the father eye nose lip
The trick ofs frown his forehead nay the valley
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek
His smiles
The very mould and frame of hand nail finger
And thou good goddess Nature which hast made it
So like to him that got it if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too mongst all colours
No yellow int lest she suspect as he does
Her children not her husbands
A gross hag
And lozel thou art worthy to be hangd
That wilt not stay her tongue
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat youll leave yourself
Hardly one subject
Once more take her hence
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more
Ill ha thee burnt
I care not
It is an heretic that makes the fire
Not she which burns int Ill not call you tyrant
But this most cruel usage of your queen
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weakhinged fancy something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you
Yea scandalous to the world
On your allegiance
Out of the chamber with her Were I a tyrant
Where were her life she durst not call me so
If she did know me one Away with her
I pray you do not push me Ill be gone
Look to your babe my lord tis yours
Jove send her
A better guiding spirit What needs these hands
You that are thus so tender oer his follies
Will never do him good not one of you
So so farewell we are gone
Exit
Thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
My child away witht Even thou that hast
A heart so tender oer it take it hence
And see it instantly consumed with fire
Even thou and none but thou Take it up straight
Within this hour bring me word tis done
And by good testimony or Ill seize thy life
With what thou else callst thine If thou refuse
And wilt encounter with my wrath say so
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out Go take it to the fire
For thou setst on thy wife
I did not sir
These lords my noble fellows if they please
Can clear me int
We can my royal liege
He is not guilty of her coming hither
Youre liars all
Beseech your highness give us better credit
We have always truly served you and beseech you
So to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come that you do change this purpose
Which being so horrible so bloody must
Lead on to some foul issue we all kneel
I am a feather for each wind that blows
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father better burn it now
Than curse it then But be it let it live
It shall not neither You sir come you hither
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery your midwife there
To save this bastards lifefor tis a bastard
So sure as this beards grey

And nobleness impose at least thus much
Ill pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent any thing possible
It shall be possible Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding
I will my lord
Mark and perform it seest thou for the fail
Of any point int shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewdtongued wife
Whom for this time we pardon We enjoin thee
As thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions and that there thou leave it
Without more mercy to its own protection
And favour of the climate As by strange fortune
It came to us I do in justice charge thee
On thy souls peril and thy bodys torture
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it Take it up
I swear to do this though a present death
Had been more merciful Come on poor babe
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses Wolves and bears they say
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity Sir be prosperous
In more than this deed does require And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side
Poor thing condemnd to loss

Enter a Servant
Please your highness posts
From those you sent to the oracle are come
An hour since Cleomenes and Dion
Being well arrived from Delphos are both landed
Hasting to the court
So please you sir their speed
Hath been beyond account
Twentythree days
They have been absent tis good speed foretells
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear Prepare you lords
Summon a session that we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady for as she hath
Been publicly accused so shall she have
A just and open trial While she lives
My heart will be a burthen to me Leave me
And think upon my bidding
Exeunt
Enter CLEOMENES and DION
The climates delicate the air most sweet
Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears
I shall report
For most it caught me the celestial habits
Methinks I so should term them and the reverence
Of the grave wearers O the sacrifice
How ceremonious solemn and unearthly
It was i the offering
But of all the burst
And the eardeafening voice o the oracle
Kin to Joves thunder so surprised my sense
That I was nothing
If the event o the journey
Prove as successful to the queenO bet so
As it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy
The time is worth the use ont
Great Apollo
Turn all to the best These proclamations
So forcing faults upon Hermione
I little like
The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business when the oracle
Thus by Apollos great divine seald up
Shall the contents discover something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge Go fresh horses
And gracious be the issue
Exeunt
Enter LEONTES Lords and Officers
This sessions to our great grief we pronounce
Even pushes gainst our heart the party tried
The daughter of a king our wife and one
Of us too much beloved Let us be cleard
Of being tyrannous since we so openly
Proceed in justice which shall have due course
Even to the guilt or the purgation
Produce the prisoner
It is his highness pleasure that the queen
Appear in person here in court Silence
Enter HERMIONE guarded PAULINA and Ladies attending
Read the indictment
Reads            Hermione queen to the worthy
Leontes king of Sicilia thou art here accused and
arraigned of high treason in committing adultery
with Polixenes king of Bohemia and conspiring
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
lord the king thy royal husband the pretence
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open
thou Hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance
of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for
their better safety to fly away by night
Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
To say not guilty mine integrity
Being counted falsehood shall as I express it
Be so received But thus if powers divine
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience You my lord best know
Who least will seem to do so my past life
Hath been as continent as chaste as true
As I am now unhappy which is more
Than history can pattern though devised
And playd to take spectators For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed which owe
A moiety of the throne a great kings daughter
The mother to a hopeful prince here standing
To prate and talk for life and honour fore
Who please to come and hear For life I prize it
As I weigh grief which I would spare for honour
Tis a derivative from me to mine
And only that I stand for I appeal
To your own conscience sir before Polixenes
Came to your court how I was in your grace
How merited to be so since he came
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have straind to appear thus if one jot beyond
That way inclining hardend be the hearts
Of all that hear me and my nearst of kin
Cry fie upon my grave
I neer heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first
Thats true enough
Through tis a saying sir not due to me
You will not own it
More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault I must not
At all acknowledge For Polixenes
With whom I am accused I do confess
I loved him as in honour he required
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me with a love even such
So and no other as yourself commanded
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
Even since it could speak from an infant freely
That it was yours Now for conspiracy
I know not how it tastes though it be dishd
For me to try how all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man
And why he left your court the gods themselves
Wotting no more than I are ignorant
You knew of his departure as you know
What you have undertaen to do ins absence
Sir
You speak a language that I understand not
My life stands in the level of your dreams
Which Ill lay down
You had a bastard by Polixenes
And I but dreamd it As you were past all shame
Which to deny concerns more than avails for as
Thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
No father owning itwhich is indeed
More criminal in thee than itso thou
Shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death
Sir spare your threats
The bug which you would fright me with I seek
To me can life be no commodity
The crown and comfort of my life your favour
I do give lost for I do feel it gone
But know not how it went My second joy
And firstfruits of my body from his presence
I am barrd like one infectious My third comfort
Starrd most unluckily is from my breast
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth
Haled out to murder myself on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred
The childbed privilege denied which longs
To women of all fashion lastly hurried
Here to this place i the open air before
I have got strength of limit Now my liege
Tell me what blessings I have here alive
That I should fear to die Therefore proceed
But yet hear this mistake me not no life
I prize it not a straw but for mine honour
Which I would free if I shall be condemnd
Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake I tell you
Tis rigor and not law Your honours all
I do refer me to the oracle
Apollo be my judge
This your request
Is altogether just therefore bring forth
And in Apollos name his oracle
Exeunt certain Officers
The Emperor of Russia was my father
O that he were alive and here beholding
His daughters trial that he did but see
The flatness of my misery yet with eyes
Of pity not revenge
Reenter Officers with CLEOMENES and DION
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice
That you Cleomenes and Dion have
Been both at Delphos and from thence have brought
The sealdup oracle by the hand deliverd
Of great Apollos priest and that since then
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets int
All this we swear
Break up the seals and read
ReadsHermione is chaste
Polixenes blameless Camillo a true subject Leontes
a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten
and the king shall live without an heir if that
which is lost be not found
Now blessed be the great Apollo
Praised
Hast thou read truth
Ay my lord even so
As it is here set down
There is no truth at all i the oracle
The sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood
Enter Servant
My lord the king the king
What is the business
O sir I shall be hated to report it
The prince your son with mere conceit and fear
Of the queens speed is gone
How gone
Is dead
Apollos angry and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice
HERMIONE swoons
How now there
This news is mortal to the queen look down
And see what death is doing
Take her hence
Her heart is but oercharged she will recover
I have too much believed mine own suspicion
Beseech you tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life
Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies with HERMIONE
Apollo pardon
My great profaneness gainst thine oracle
Ill reconcile me to Polixenes
New woo my queen recall the good Camillo
Whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy
For being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes which had been done
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him
Not doing t and being done he most humane
And filld with honour to my kingly guest
Which you knew great and to the hazard
Of all encertainties himself commended
No richer than his honour how he glisters
Thorough my rust and how his pity
Does my deeds make the blacker
Reenter PAULINA
Woe the while
O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
Break too
What fit is this good lady
What studied torments tyrant hast for me
What wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
In leads or oils what old or newer torture
Must I receive whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies
Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
For girls of nine O think what they have done
And then run mad indeed stark mad for all
Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it
That thou betraydst Polixenestwas nothing
That did but show thee of a fool inconstant
And damnable ingrateful nor wast much
Thou wouldst have poisond good Camillos honour
To have him kill a king poor trespasses
More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy babydaughter
To be or none or little though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere donet
Nor ist directly laid to thee the death
Of the young prince whose honourable thoughts
Thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemishd his gracious dam this is not no
Laid to thy answer but the lastO lords
When I have said cry woe the queen the queen
The sweetst dearst creatures dead
and vengeance fort
Not droppd down yet
The higher powers forbid
I say shes dead Ill sweart If word nor oath
Prevail not go and see if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
Heat outwardly or breath within Ill serve you
As I would do the gods But O thou tyrant
Do not repent these things for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together naked fasting
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
In storm perpetual could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert
Go on go on
Thou canst not speak too much I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest
Say no more
Howeer the business goes you have made fault
I the boldness of your speech
I am sorry fort
All faults I make when I shall come to know them
I do repent Alas I have showd too much
The rashness of a woman he is touchd
To the noble heart Whats gone and whats past help
Should be past grief do not receive affliction
At my petition I beseech you rather
Let me be punishd that have minded you
Of what you should forget Now good my liege
Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
The love I bore your queenlo fool again
Ill speak of her no more nor of your children
Ill not remember you of my own lord
Who is lost too take your patience to you
And Ill say nothing
Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee Prithee bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son
One grave shall be for both upon them shall
The causes of their death appear unto
Our shame perpetual Once a day Ill visit
The chapel where they lie and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation so long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise so long
I daily vow to use it Come and lead me
Unto these sorrows
Exeunt
Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child and a Mariner
Thou art perfect then our ship hath touchd upon
The deserts of Bohemia
Ay my lord and fear
We have landed in ill time the skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters In my conscience
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
And frown upon s
Their sacred wills be done Go get aboard
Look to thy bark Ill not be long before
I call upon thee
Make your best haste and go not
Too far i the land tis like to be loud weather
Besides this place is famous for the creatures
Of prey that keep upont
Go thou away
Ill follow instantly
I am glad at heart
To be so rid o the business
Exit
Come poor babe
I have heard but not believed
the spirits o the dead
May walk again if such thing be thy mother
Appeard to me last night for neer was dream
So like a waking To me comes a creature
Sometimes her head on one side some another
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow
So filld and so becoming in pure white robes
Like very sanctity she did approach
My cabin where I lay thrice bowd before me
And gasping to begin some speech her eyes
Became two spouts the fury spent anon
Did this breakfrom her Good Antigonus
Since fate against thy better disposition
Hath made thy person for the throwerout
Of my poor babe according to thine oath
Places remote enough are in Bohemia
There weep and leave it crying and for the babe
Is counted lost for ever Perdita
I prithee callt For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord thou neer shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more And so with shrieks
She melted into air Affrighted much
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber Dreams are toys
Yet for this once yea superstitiously
I will be squared by this I do believe
Hermione hath sufferd death and that
Apollo would this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes it should here be laid
Either for life or death upon the earth
Of its right father Blossom speed thee well
Which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
And still rest thine The storm begins poor wretch
That for thy mothers fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow Weep I cannot
But my heart bleeds and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoind to this Farewell
The day frowns more and more thourt like to have
A lullaby too rough I never saw
The heavens so dim by day A savage clamour
Well may I get aboard This is the chase
I am gone for ever
Exit pursued by a bear
Enter a Shepherd

Hilloa loa
What art so near If thoult see a thing to talk
on when thou art dead and rotten come hither What
ailest thou man
I have seen two such sights by sea and by land
but I am not to say it is a sea for it is now the
sky betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
a bodkins point
Why boy how is it
I would you did but see how it chafes how it rages
how it takes up the shore but thats not the
point O the most piteous cry of the poor souls
sometimes to see em and not to see em now the
ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon
swallowed with yest and froth as yould thrust a
cork into a hogshead And then for the
landservice to see how the bear tore out his
shoulderbone how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus a nobleman But to make an
end of the ship to see how the sea flapdragoned
it but first how the poor souls roared and the
sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than
the sea or weather
Name of mercy when was this boy
Now now I have not winked since I saw these
sights the men are not yet cold under water nor
the bear half dined on the gentleman hes at it
now
Would I had been by to have helped the old man
I would you had been by the ship side to have
helped her there your charity would have lacked footing
Heavy matters heavy matters but look thee here

Exeunt
Enter Time the Chorus
I that please some try all both joy and terror
Of good and bad that makes and unfolds error
Now take upon me in the name of Time
To use my wings Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage that I slide
Oer sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap since it is in my power
To oerthrow law and in one selfborn hour
To plant and oerwhelm custom Let me pass
The same I am ere ancientst order was
Or what is now received I witness to
The times that brought them in so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present as my tale
Now seems to it Your patience this allowing
As you had slept between Leontes leaving
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself imagine me
Gentle spectators that I now may be
In fair Bohemia and remember well
I mentioned a son o the kings which Florizel
I now name to you and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita now grown in grace
Equal with wondering what of her ensues
I list not prophecy but let Times news
Be known when tis brought forth
A shepherds daughter
And what to her adheres which follows after
Is the argument of Time Of this allow
If ever you have spent time worse ere now
If never yet that Time himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never may

Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO
I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate
tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to
grant this
It is fifteen years since I saw my country though
I have for the most part been aired abroad I
desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent
king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay or I oerween to
think so which is another spur to my departure
As thou lovest me Camillo wipe not out the rest of
thy services by leaving me now the need I have of
thee thine own goodness hath made better not to
have had thee than thus to want thee thou having
made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently manage must either stay to execute
them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done which if I have not enough
considered as too much I cannot to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit
therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal
country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king
my brother whose loss of his most precious queen
and children are even now to be afresh lamented
Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my
son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not
being gracious than they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues
Sir it is three days since I saw the prince What
his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I
have missingly noted he is of late much retired
from court and is less frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared
I have considered so much Camillo and with some
care so far that I have eyes under my service which
look upon his removedness from whom I have this
intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a
most homely shepherd a man they say that from
very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
I have heard sir of such a man who hath a
daughter of most rare note the report of her is
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage
Thats likewise part of my intelligence but I
fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou
shalt accompany us to the place where we will not
appearing what we are have some question with the
shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither
Prithee be my present partner in this business and
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia
I willingly obey your command
My best Camillo We must disguise ourselves

Enter AUTOLYCUS singing
When daffodils begin to peer
With heigh the doxy over the dale
Why then comes in the sweet o the year
For the red blood reigns in the winters pale
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge
With heigh the sweet birds O how they sing
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king
The lark that tirralyra chants
With heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay
Are summer songs for me and my aunts
While we lie tumbling in the hay
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore threepile but now I am out of service
But shall I go mourn for that my dear
The pale moon shines by night
And when I wander here and there
I then do most go right
If tinkers may have leave to live
And bear the sowskin budget
Then my account I well may give
And in the stocks avouch it
My traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to
lesser linen My father named me Autolycus who
being as I am littered under Mercury was likewise
a snapperup of unconsidered trifles With die and
drab I purchased this caparison and my revenue is
the silly cheat Gallows and knock are too powerful
on the highway beating and hanging are terrors to
me for the life to come I sleep out the thought
of it A prize a prize

Grovelling on the ground

O help me help me pluck but off these rags and
then death death
Alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee rather than have these off
O sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes I have received which are mighty
ones and millions
Alas poor man a million of beating may come to a
great matter
I am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel
taen from me and these detestable things put upon
me
What by a horseman or a footman
A footman sweet sir a footman
Indeed he should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee if this be a horsemans coat
it hath seen very hot service Lend me thy hand
Ill help thee come lend me thy hand
O good sir tenderly O
Alas poor soul
O good sir softly good sir I fear sir my
shoulderblade is out
How now canst stand
Picking his pocket
Softly dear sir good sir softly You ha done me
a charitable office
Dost lack any money I have a little money for thee
No good sweet sir no I beseech you sir I have
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence
unto whom I was going I shall there have money or
any thing I want offer me no money I pray you
that kills my heart
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you
A fellow sir that I have known to go about with
trollmydames I knew him once a servant of the
prince I cannot tell good sir for which of his
virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court
His vices you would say theres no virtue whipped
out of the court they cherish it to make it stay
there and yet it will no more but abide
Vices I would say sir I know this man well he
hath been since an apebearer then a
processserver a bailiff then he compassed a
motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinkers
wife within a mile where my land and living lies
and having flown over many knavish professions he
settled only in rogue some call him Autolycus
Out upon him prig for my life prig he haunts
wakes fairs and bearbaitings
Very true sir he sir he thats the rogue that
put me into this apparel
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia if you had
but looked big and spit at him held have run
I must confess to you sir I am no fighter I am
false of heart that way and that he knew I warrant
him
How do you now
Sweet sir much better than I was I can stand and
walk I will even take my leave of you and pace
softly towards my kinsmans
Shall I bring thee on the way
No goodfaced sir no sweet sir
Then fare thee well I must go buy spices for our
sheepshearing
Prosper you sweet sir

These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life no shepherdess but Flora
Peering in Aprils front This your sheepshearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods
And you the queen ont
Sir my gracious lord
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me
O pardon that I name them Your high self
The gracious mark o the land you have obscured
With a swains wearing and me poor lowly maid
Most goddesslike prankd up but that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom I should blush
To see you so attired sworn I think
To show myself a glass
I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy fathers ground
Now Jove afford you cause
To me the difference forges dread your greatness
Hath not been used to fear Even now I tremble
To think your father by some accident
Should pass this way as you did O the Fates
How would he look to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up What would he say Or how
Should I in these my borrowd flaunts behold
The sternness of his presence
Apprehend
Nothing but jollity The gods themselves
Humbling their deities to love have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter
Became a bull and bellowd the green Neptune
A ram and bleated and the firerobed god
Golden Apollo a poor humble swain
As I seem now Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer
Nor in a way so chaste since my desires
Run not before mine honour nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith
O but sir
Your resolution cannot hold when tis
Opposed as it must be by the power of the king
One of these two must be necessities
Which then will speak that you must
change this purpose
Or I my life
Thou dearest Perdita
With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not
The mirth o the feast Or Ill be thine my fair
Or not my fathers For I cannot be
Mine own nor any thing to any if
I be not thine To this I am most constant
Though destiny say no Be merry gentle
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold the while Your guests are coming
Lift up your countenance as it were the day
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come
O lady Fortune
Stand you auspicious
See your guests approach
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly
And lets be red with mirth
Enter Shepherd Clown MOPSA DORCAS and others with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised
Fie daughter when my old wife lived upon
This day she was both pantler butler cook
Both dame and servant welcomed all served all
Would sing her song and dance her turn now here
At upper end o the table now i the middle
On his shoulder and his her face o fire
With labour and the thing she took to quench it
She would to each one sip You are retired
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting pray you bid
These unknown friends tos welcome for it is
A way to make us better friends more known
Come quench your blushes and present yourself

Youre welcome sir
Give me those flowers there Dorcas Reverend sirs
For you theres rosemary and rue these keep
Seeming and savour all the winter long
Grace and remembrance be to you both
And welcome to our shearing
Shepherdess
A fair one are youwell you fit our ages
With flowers of winter
Sir the year growing ancient
Not yet on summers death nor on the birth
Of trembling winter the fairest
flowers o the season
Are our carnations and streakd gillyvors
Which some call natures bastards of that kind
Our rustic gardens barren and I care not
To get slips of them
Wherefore gentle maiden
Do you neglect them
For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature
Say there be
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean so over that art
Which you say adds to nature is an art
That nature makes You see sweet maid we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race this is an art
Which does mend nature change it rather but
The art itself is nature
So it is
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors
And do not call them bastards
Ill not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them
No more than were I painted I would wish
This youth should say twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me Heres flowers for you
Hot lavender mints savoury marjoram
The marigold that goes to bed wi the sun
And with him rises weeping these are flowers
Of middle summer and I think they are given
To men of middle age Youre very welcome
I should leave grazing were I of your flock
And only live by gazing
Out alas
Youd be so lean that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through
Now my fairst friend
I would I had some flowers o the spring that might
Become your time of day and yours and yours
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing O Proserpina
For the flowers now that frighted thou letst fall
From Diss waggon daffodils
That come before the swallow dares and take
The winds of March with beauty violets dim
But sweeter than the lids of Junos eyes
Or Cythereas breath pale primroses
That die unmarried ere they can behold
Bight Phoebus in his strengtha malady
Most incident to maids bold oxlips and
The crown imperial lilies of all kinds
The flowerdeluce being one O these I lack
To make you garlands of and my sweet friend
To strew him oer and oer
What like a corse
No like a bank for love to lie and play on
Not like a corse or if not to be buried
But quick and in mine arms Come take your flowers
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition
What you do
Still betters what is done When you speak sweet
Ild have you do it ever when you sing
Ild have you buy and sell so so give alms
Pray so and for the ordering your affairs
To sing them too when you do dance I wish you
A wave o the sea that you might ever do
Nothing but that move still still so
And own no other function each your doing
So singular in each particular
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed
O Doricles
Your praises are too large but that your youth
And the true blood which peepeth fairly throught
Do plainly give you out an unstaind shepherd
With wisdom I might fear my Doricles
You wood me the false way
I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you tot But come our dance I pray
Your hand my Perdita so turtles pair
That never mean to part
Ill swear for em
This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever
Ran on the greensward nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something greater than herself
Too noble for this place
He tells her something
That makes her blood look out good sooth she is
The queen of curds and cream
Come on strike up
Mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic
To mend her kissing with
Now in good time
Not a word a word we stand upon our manners
Come strike up
Music Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses
Pray good shepherd what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter
They call him Doricles and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it
He looks like sooth He says he loves my daughter
I think so too for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as hell stand and read
As twere my daughters eyes and to be plain
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best
She dances featly
So she does any thing though I report it
That should be silent if young Doricles
Do light upon her she shall bring him that
Which he not dreams of
Enter Servant
O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the
door you would never dance again after a tabour and
pipe no the bagpipe could not move you he sings
several tunes faster than youll tell money he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all mens
ears grew to his tunes
He could never come better he shall come in I
love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful
matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably
He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he
has the prettiest lovesongs for maids so without
bawdry which is strange with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings jump her and thump
her and where some stretchmouthed rascal would
as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into
the matter he makes the maid to answer Whoop do me
no harm good man puts him off slights him with
Whoop do me no harm good man
This is a brave fellow
Believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow Has he any unbraided wares
He hath ribbons of an the colours i the rainbow
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle though they come to him by the
gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns why he
sings em over as they were gods or goddesses you
would think a smock were a sheangel he so chants
to the sleevehand and the work about the square ont
Prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in s tunes
Exit Servant
You have of these pedlars that have more in them
than yould think sister
Ay good brother or go about to think
Enter AUTOLYCUS singing
Lawn as white as driven snow
Cyprus black as eer was crow
Gloves as sweet as damask roses
Masks for faces and for noses
Bugle bracelet necklace amber
Perfume for a ladys chamber
Golden quoifs and stomachers
For my lads to give their dears
Pins and pokingsticks of steel
What maids lack from head to heel
Come buy of me come come buy come buy
Buy lads or else your lasses cry Come buy
If I were not in love with Mopsa thou shouldst take
no money of me but being enthralled as I am it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves
I was promised them against the feast but they come
not too late now
He hath promised you more than that or there be liars
He hath paid you all he promised you may be he has
paid you more which will shame you to give him again
Is there no manners left among maids will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces Is there not milkingtime when you are
going to bed or kilnhole to whistle off these
secrets but you must be tittletattling before all
our guests tis well they are whispering clamour
your tongues and not a word more
I have done Come you promised me a tawdrylace
and a pair of sweet gloves
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money
And indeed sir there are cozeners abroad
therefore it behoves men to be wary
Fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here
I hope so sir for I have about me many parcels of charge
What hast here ballads
Pray now buy some I love a ballad in print o
life for then we are sure they are true
Heres one to a very doleful tune how a usurers
wife was brought to bed of twenty moneybags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders heads and
toads carbonadoed
Is it true think you
Very true and but a month old
Bless me from marrying a usurer
Heres the midwifes name tot one Mistress
Taleporter and five or six honest wives that were
present Why should I carry lies abroad
Pray you now buy it
Come on lay it by and lets first see moe
ballads well buy the other things anon
Heres another ballad of a fish that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April
forty thousand fathom above water and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her the ballad is very pitiful and as true
Is it true too think you
Five justices hands at it and witnesses more than
my pack will hold
Lay it by too another
This is a merry ballad but a very pretty one
Lets have some merry ones
Why this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of Two maids wooing a man theres
scarce a maid westward but she sings it tis in
request I can tell you
We can both sing it if thoult bear a part thou
shalt hear tis in three parts
We had the tune ont a month ago
I can bear my part you must know tis my
occupation have at it with you

Exit
Reenter Servant
Master there is three carters three shepherds
three neatherds three swineherds that have made
themselves all men of hair they call themselves
Saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are
not int but they themselves are o the mind if it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling it will please plentifully
Away well none on t here has been too much
homely foolery already I know sir we weary you
You weary those that refresh us pray lets see
these four threes of herdsmen
One three of them by their own report sir hath
danced before the king and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier
Leave your prating since these good men are
pleased let them come in but quickly now
Why they stay at door sir
Exit
Here a dance of twelve Satyrs
O father youll know more of that hereafter
To CAMILLO
Is it not too far gone Tis time to part them
Hes simple and tells much
To FLORIZEL
How now fair shepherd
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting Sooth when I was young
And handed love as you do I was wont
To load my she with knacks I would have ransackd
The pedlars silken treasury and have pourd it
To her acceptance you have let him go
And nothing marted with him If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty you were straited
For a reply at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her
Old sir I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are
The gifts she looks from me are packd and lockd
Up in my heart which I have given already
But not deliverd O hear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir who it should seem
Hath sometime loved I take thy hand this hand
As soft as doves down and as white as it
Or Ethiopians tooth or the fannd
snow thats bolted
By the northern blasts twice oer
What follows this
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before I have put you out
But to your protestation let me hear
What you profess
Do and be witness to t
And this my neighbour too
And he and more
Than he and men the earth the heavens and all
That were I crownd the most imperial monarch
Thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
More than was ever mans I would not prize them
Without her love for her employ them all
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition
Fairly offerd
This shows a sound affection
But my daughter
Say you the like to him
I cannot speak
So well nothing so well no nor mean better
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his
Take hands a bargain
And friends unknown you shall bear witness to t
I give my daughter to him and will make
Her portion equal his
O that must be
I the virtue of your daughter one being dead
I shall have more than you can dream of yet
Enough then for your wonder But come on
Come your hand
And daughter yours
Soft swain awhile beseech you
Have you a father
I have but what of him
Knows he of this
He neither does nor shall
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table Pray you once more
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums can he speak hear
Know man from man dispute his own estate
Lies he not bedrid and again does nothing
But what he did being childish
No good sir
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age
By my white beard
You offer him if this be so a wrong
Something unfilial reason my son
Should choose himself a wife but as good reason
The father all whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity should hold some counsel
In such a business
I yield all this
But for some other reasons my grave sir
Which tis not fit you know I not acquaint
My father of this business
Let him knowt
He shall not
Prithee let him
No he must not
Let him my son he shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice
Come come he must not
Mark your divorce young sir
Discovering himself
Whom son I dare not call thou art too base
To be acknowledged thou a sceptres heir
That thus affectst a sheephook Thou old traitor
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
But shorten thy life one week And thou fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
The royal fool thou copest with
O my heart
Ill have thy beauty scratchd with briers and made
More homely than thy state For thee fond boy
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knack as never
I mean thou shalt well bar thee from succession
Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
Far than Deucalion off mark thou my words
Follow us to the court Thou churl for this time
Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it And you enchantment
Worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
That makes himself but for our honour therein
Unworthy theeif ever henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
As thou art tender tot
Exit
Even here undone
I was not much afeard for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Looks on alike Willt please you sir be gone
I told you what would come of this beseech you
Of your own state take care this dream of mine
Being now awake Ill queen it no inch farther
But milk my ewes and weep
Why how now father
Speak ere thou diest
I cannot speak nor think
Nor dare to know that which I know O sir
You have undone a man of fourscore three
That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
To die upon the bed my father died
To lie close by his honest bones but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust O cursed wretch
That knewst this was the prince
and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him Undone undone
If I might die within this hour I have lived
To die when I desire
Exit
Why look you so upon me
I am but sorry not afeard delayd
But nothing alterd what I was I am
More straining on for plucking back not following
My leash unwillingly
Gracious my lord
You know your fathers temper at this time
He will allow no speech which I do guess
You do not purpose to him and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet I fear
Then till the fury of his highness settle
Come not before him
I not purpose it
I think Camillo
Even he my lord
How often have I told you twould be thus
How often said my dignity would last
But till twere known
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith and then
Let nature crush the sides o the earth together
And mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks
From my succession wipe me father I
Am heir to my affection
Be advised
I am and by my fancy if my reason
Will thereto be obedient I have reason
If not my senses better pleased with madness
Do bid it welcome
This is desperate sir
So call it but it does fulfil my vow
I needs must think it honesty Camillo
Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may
Be thereat gleand for all the sun sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms will I break my oath
To this my fair beloved therefore I pray you
As you have ever been my fathers honourd friend
When he shall miss meas in faith I mean not
To see him any morecast your good counsels
Upon his passion let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to come This you may know
And so deliver I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by but not prepared
For this design What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
Concern me the reporting
O my lord
I would your spirit were easier for advice
Or stronger for your need
Hark Perdita
Drawing her aside
Ill hear you by and by
Hes irremoveable
Resolved for flight Now were I happy if
His going I could frame to serve my turn
Save him from danger do him love and honour
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king my master whom
I so much thirst to see
Now good Camillo
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony
Sir I think
You have heard of my poor services i the love
That I have borne your father
Very nobly
Have you deserved it is my fathers music
To speak your deeds not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on
Well my lord
If you may please to think I love the king
And through him what is nearest to him which is
Your gracious self embrace but my direction
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration on mine honour
Ill point you where you shall have such receiving
As shall become your highness where you may
Enjoy your mistress from the whom I see
Theres no disjunction to be made but by
As heavens forefendyour ruin marry her
And with my best endeavours in your absence
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking
How Camillo
May this almost a miracle be done
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee
Have you thought on
A place whereto youll go
Not any yet
But as the unthoughton accident is guilty
To what we wildly do so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows
Then list to me
This follows if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight make for Sicilia
And there present yourself and your fair princess
For so I see she must be fore Leontes
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness
As twere i the fathers person kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess oer and oer divides him
Twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time
Worthy Camillo
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him
Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts Sir
The manner of your bearing towards him with
What you as from your father shall deliver
Things known betwixt us three Ill write you down
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say that he shall not perceive
But that you have your fathers bosom there
And speak his very heart
I am bound to you
There is some sap in this
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpathd waters undreamd shores most certain
To miseries enough no hope to help you
But as you shake off one to take another
Nothing so certain as your anchors who
Do their best office if they can but stay you
Where youll be loath to be besides you know
Prosperitys the very bond of love
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters
One of these is true
I think affliction may subdue the cheek
But not take in the mind
Yea say you so
There shall not at your fathers house these
seven years
Be born another such
My good Camillo
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is i the rear our birth
I cannot say tis pity
She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
To most that teach
Your pardon sir for this
Ill blush you thanks
My prettiest Perdita
But O the thorns we stand upon Camillo
Preserver of my father now of me
The medicine of our house how shall we do
We are not furnishd like Bohemias son
Nor shall appear in Sicilia
My lord
Fear none of this I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there it shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
That you may know you shall not want one word
They talk aside
Reenter AUTOLYCUS
Ha ha what a fool Honesty is and Trust his
sworn brother a very simple gentleman I have sold
all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a
ribbon glass pomander brooch tablebook ballad
knife tape glove shoetie bracelet hornring
to keep my pack from fasting they throng who
should buy first as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture and what I saw to my good use I
remembered My clown who wants but something to
be a reasonable man grew so in love with the
wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it
was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains no hearing no feeling but my sirs song
and admiring the nothing of it So that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses and had not the old man come in
with a whoobub against his daughter and the kings
son and scared my choughs from the chaff I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army
CAMILLO FLORIZEL and PERDITA come forward
Nay but my letters by this means being there
So soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
And those that youll procure from King Leontes
Shall satisfy your father
Happy be you
All that you speak shows fair
Who have we here
Seeing AUTOLYCUS
Well make an instrument of this omit
Nothing may give us aid
If they have overheard me now why hanging
How now good fellow why shakest thou so Fear
not man heres no harm intended to thee
I am a poor fellow sir
Why be so still heres nobody will steal that from
thee yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly
thou must think theres a necessity intand
change garments with this gentleman though the
pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee
theres some boot
I am a poor fellow sir
Aside
I know ye well enough
Nay prithee dispatch the gentleman is half
flayed already
Are you in earnest sir
Aside
I smell the trick ont
Dispatch I prithee
Indeed I have had earnest but I cannot with
conscience take it
Unbuckle unbuckle
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments
Fortunate mistresslet my prophecy
Come home to yeyou must retire yourself
Into some covert take your sweethearts hat
And pluck it oer your brows muffle your face
Dismantle you and as you can disliken
The truth of your own seeming that you may
For I do fear eyes overto shipboard
Get undescried
I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part
No remedy
Have you done there
Should I now meet my father
He would not call me son
Nay you shall have no hat
Giving it to PERDITA
Come lady come Farewell my friend
Adieu sir
O Perdita what have we twain forgot
Pray you a word
Aside  What I do next shall be to tell the king
Of this escape and whither they are bound
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
To force him after in whose company
I shall review Sicilia for whose sight
I have a womans longing
Fortune speed us
Thus we set on Camillo to the seaside
The swifter speed the better
Exeunt FLORIZEL PERDITA and CAMILLO
I understand the business I hear it to have an
open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is
necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite
also to smell out work for the other senses I see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive
What an exchange had this been without boot What
a boot is here with this exchange Sure the gods do
this year connive at us and we may do any thing
extempore The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity stealing away from his father with his
clog at his heels if I thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal I would not
dot I hold it the more knavery to conceal it
and therein am I constant to my profession
Reenter Clown and Shepherd
Aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain
every lanes end every shop church session
hanging yields a careful man work
See see what a man you are now
There is no other way but to tell the king
shes a changeling and none of your flesh and blood
Nay but hear me
Nay but hear me
Go to then
She being none of your flesh and blood your flesh
and blood has not offended the king and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him Show
those things you found about her those secret
things all but what she has with her this being
done let the law go whistle I warrant you
I will tell the king all every word yea and his
sons pranks too who I may say is no honest man
neither to his father nor to me to go about to make
me the kings brotherinlaw
Indeed brotherinlaw was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce
Aside  Very wisely puppies
Well let us to the king there is that in this
fardel will make him scratch his beard
Aside  I know not what impediment this complaint
may be to the flight of my master
Pray heartily he be at palace
Aside  Though I am not naturally honest I am so
sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlars excrement
Takes off his false beard
How now rustics whither are you bound
To the palace an it like your worship
Your affairs there what with whom the condition
of that fardel the place of your dwelling your
names your ages of what having breeding and any
thing that is fitting to be known discover
We are but plain fellows sir
A lie you are rough and hairy Let me have no
lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they
often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for
it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore
they do not give us the lie
Your worship had like to have given us one if you
had not taken yourself with the manner
Are you a courtier ant like you sir
Whether it like me or no I am a courtier Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court
receives not thy nose courtodor from me reflect I
not on thy baseness courtcontempt Thinkest thou
for that I insinuate or toaze from thee thy
business I am therefore no courtier I am courtier
capape and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there whereupon I command thee to
open thy affair
My business sir is to the king
What advocate hast thou to him
I know not ant like you
Advocates the courtword for a pheasant say you
have none
None sir I have no pheasant cock nor hen
How blessed are we that are not simple men
Yet nature might have made me as these are
Therefore I will not disdain
This cannot be but a great courtier
His garments are rich but he wears
them not handsomely
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical
a great man Ill warrant I know by the picking
ons teeth
The fardel there whats i the fardel
Wherefore that box
Sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box
which none must know but the king and which he
shall know within this hour if I may come to the
speech of him
Age thou hast lost thy labour
Why sir
The king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for
if thou beest capable of things serious thou must
know the king is full of grief
So tis said sir about his son that should have
married a shepherds daughter
If that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly
the curses he shall have the tortures he shall
feel will break the back of man the heart of monster
Think you so sir
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to
him though removed fifty times shall all come
under the hangman which though it be great pity
yet it is necessary An old sheepwhistling rogue a
ramtender to offer to have his daughter come into
grace Some say he shall be stoned but that death
is too soft for him say Idraw our throne into a
sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy
Has the old man eer a son sir do you hear ant
like you sir
He has a son who shall be flayed alive then
nointed over with honey set on the head of a
wasps nest then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead then recovered again with
aquavitae or some other hot infusion then raw as
he is and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims shall be be set against a brickwall the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries
are to be smiled at their offences being so
capital Tell me for you seem to be honest plain
men what you have to the king being something
gently considered Ill bring you where he is
aboard tender your persons to his presence
whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man
besides the king to effect your suits here is man
shall do it
He seems to be of great authority close with him
give him gold and though authority be a stubborn
bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand
and no more ado Remember stoned and flayed alive
Ant please you sir to undertake the business for
us here is that gold I have Ill make it as much
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you
After I have done what I promised
Ay sir
Well give me the moiety Are you a party in this business
In some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful
one I hope I shall not be flayed out of it
O thats the case of the shepherds son hang him
hell be made an example
Comfort good comfort We must to the king and show
our strange sights he must know tis none of your
daughter nor my sister we are gone else Sir I
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed and remain as he says your
pawn till it be brought you
I will trust you Walk before toward the seaside
go on the right hand I will but look upon the
hedge and follow you
We are blest in this man as I may say even blest
Lets before as he bids us he was provided to do us good
Exeunt Shepherd and Clown
If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would
not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth I am
courted now with a double occasion gold and a means
to do the prince my master good which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement I will bring
these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing let him call me rogue for being so far
officious for I am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs tot To him will I present
them there may be matter in it
Exit
Enter LEONTES CLEOMENES DION PAULINA and Servants
Sir you have done enough and have performd
A saintlike sorrow no fault could you make
Which you have not redeemd indeed paid down
More penitence than done trespass at the last
Do as the heavens have done forget your evil
With them forgive yourself
Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues I cannot forget
My blemishes in them and so still think of
The wrong I did myself which was so much
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man
Bred his hopes out of
True too true my lord
If one by one you wedded all the world
Or from the all that are took something good
To make a perfect woman she you killd
Would be unparalleld
I think so Killd
She I killd I did so but thou strikest me
Sorely to say I did it is as bitter
Upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now
Say so but seldom
Not at all good lady
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better
You are one of those
Would have him wed again
If you would not so
You pity not the state nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name consider little
What dangers by his highness fail of issue
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers on What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well
What holier than for royaltys repair
For present comfort and for future good
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow tot
There is none worthy
Respecting her thats gone Besides the gods
Will have fulfilld their secret purposes
For has not the divine Apollo said
Ist not the tenor of his oracle
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found which that it shall
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me who on my life
Did perish with the infant Tis your counsel
My lord should to the heavens be contrary
Oppose against their wills
To LEONTES
Care not for issue
The crown will find an heir great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest so his successor
Was like to be the best
Good Paulina
Who hast the memory of Hermione
I know in honour O that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel then even now
I might have lookd upon my queens full eyes
Have taken treasure from her lips
And left them
More rich for what they yielded
Thou speakst truth
No more such wives therefore no wife one worse
And better used would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse and on this stage
Where were offenders now appear soulvexd
And begin Why to me
Had she such power
She had just cause
She had and would incense me
To murder her I married
I should so
Were I the ghost that walkd Ild bid you mark
Her eye and tell me for what dull part int
You chose her then Ild shriek that even your ears
Should rift to hear me and the words that followd
Should be Remember mine
Stars stars
And all eyes else dead coals Fear thou no wife
Ill have no wife Paulina
Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave
Never Paulina so be blest my spirit
Then good my lords bear witness to his oath
You tempt him overmuch
Unless another
As like Hermione as is her picture
Affront his eye
Good madam
I have done
Yet if my lord will marryif you will sir
No remedy but you willgive me the office
To choose you a queen she shall not be so young
As was your former but she shall be such
As walkd your first queens ghost
it should take joy
To see her in your arms
My true Paulina
We shall not marry till thou bidst us
That
Shall be when your first queens again in breath
Never till then

One that gives out himself Prince Florizel
Son of Polixenes with his princess she
The fairest I have yet beheld desires access
To your high presence
What with him he comes not
Like to his fathers greatness his approach
So out of circumstance and sudden tells us
Tis not a visitation framed but forced
By need and accident What train
But few
And those but mean
His princess say you with him
Ay the most peerless piece of earth I think
That eer the sun shone bright on
O Hermione
As every present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone so must thy grave
Give way to whats seen now Sir you yourself
Have said and writ so but your writing now
Is colder than that theme She had not been
Nor was not to be equalldthus your verse
Flowd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebbd
To say you have seen a better
Pardon madam
The one I have almost forgotyour pardon
The other when she has obtaind your eye
Will have your tongue too This is a creature
Would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
Of all professors else make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow
How not women
Women will love her that she is a woman
More worth than any man men that she is
The rarest of all women

Jewel of children seen this hour he had paird

Between their births
Prithee no more cease thou knowst

When I shall see this gentleman thy speeches
Will bring me to consider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason They are come
Reenter CLEOMENES and others with FLORIZEL and PERDITA
Your mother was most true to wedlock prince
For she did print your royal father off
Conceiving you were I but twentyone
Your fathers image is so hit in you
His very air that I should call you brother
As I did him and speak of something wildly
By us performd before Most dearly welcome
And your fair princessgoddessO alas
I lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You gracious couple do and then I lost
All mine own follythe society
Amity too of your brave father whom
Though bearing misery I desire my life
Once more to look on him
By his command
Have I here touchd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king at friend
Can send his brother and but infirmity
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
His wishd ability he had himself
The lands and waters twixt your throne and his
Measured to look upon you whom he loves
He bade me say somore than all the sceptres
And those that bear them living
O my brother
Good gentleman the wrongs I have done thee stir
Afresh within me and these thy offices
So rarely kind are as interpreters
Of my behindhand slackness Welcome hither
As is the spring to the earth And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage
At least ungentle of the dreadful Neptune
To greet a man not worth her pains much less
The adventure of her person
Good my lord
She came from Libya
Where the warlike Smalus
That noble honourd lord is feard and loved
Most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
His tears proclaimd his parting with her thence
A prosperous southwind friendly we have crossd
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your highness my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismissd
Who for Bohemia bend to signify
Not only my success in Libya sir
But my arrival and my wifes in safety
Here where we are
The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here You have a holy father
A graceful gentleman against whose person
So sacred as it is I have done sin
For which the heavens taking angry note
Have left me issueless and your fathers blest
As he from heaven merits it with you
Worthy his goodness What might I have been
Might I a son and daughter now have lookd on
Such goodly things as you
Enter a Lord
Most noble sir
That which I shall report will bear no credit
Were not the proof so nigh Please you great sir
Bohemia greets you from himself by me
Desires you to attach his son who has
His dignity and duty both cast off
Fled from his father from his hopes and with
A shepherds daughter
Wheres Bohemia speak
Here in your city I now came from him
I speak amazedly and it becomes
My marvel and my message To your court
Whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems
Of this fair couple meets he on the way
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother having both their country quitted
With this young prince
Camillo has betrayd me
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers
Layt so to his charge
Hes with the king your father
Who Camillo
Camillo sir I spake with him who now
Has these poor men in question Never saw I
Wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth
Forswear themselves as often as they speak
Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
With divers deaths in death
O my poor father
The heaven sets spies upon us will not have
You are married
We are not sir nor are we like to be
The stars I see will kiss the valleys first
The odds for high and lows alike
My lord
Is this the daughter of a king
She is
When once she is my wife
That once I see by your good fathers speed
Will come on very slowly I am sorry
Most sorry you have broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
That you might well enjoy her
Dear look up
Though Fortune visible an enemy
Should chase us with my father power no jot
Hath she to change our loves Beseech you sir
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now with thought of such affections
Step forth mine advocate at your request
My father will grant precious things as trifles
Would he do so Ild beg your precious mistress
Which he counts but a trifle
Sir my liege
Your eye hath too much youth int not a month
Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now
I thought of her
Even in these looks I made
To FLORIZEL
But your petition
Is yet unanswerd I will to your father
Your honour not oerthrown by your desires
I am friend to them and you upon which errand
I now go toward him therefore follow me
And mark what way I make come good my lord
Exeunt
Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman
Beseech you sir were you present at this relation
I was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it
whereupon after a little amazedness we were all
commanded out of the chamber only this methought I
heard the shepherd say he found the child
I would most gladly know the issue of it
I make a broken delivery of the business but the
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
very notes of admiration they seemed almost with
staring on one another to tear the cases of their
eyes there was speech in their dumbness language
in their very gesture they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest
beholder that knew no more but seeing could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the
extremity of the one it must needs be
Enter another Gentleman
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more
The news Rogero
Nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the
kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that balladmakers
cannot be able to express it
Enter a third Gentleman
Here comes the Lady Paulinas steward he can
deliver you more How goes it now sir this news
which is called true is so like an old tale that
the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king
found his heir
Most true if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance that which you hear youll swear you
see there is such unity in the proofs The mantle
of Queen Hermiones her jewel about the neck of it
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
creature in resemblance of the mother the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the kings daughter Did you see
the meeting of the two kings
No
Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen
cannot be spoken of There might you have beheld one
joy crown another so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their
joy waded in tears There was casting up of eyes
holding up of hands with countenances of such
not by favour Our king being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter as if that
joy were now become a loss cries O thy mother
thy mother then asks Bohemia forgiveness then
embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old
shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten
conduit of many kings reigns I never heard of such
another encounter which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it
What pray you became of Antigonus that carried
hence the child
Like an old tale still which will have matter to
rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear
open He was torn to pieces with a bear this
avouches the shepherds son who has not only his
innocence which seems much to justify him but a
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows
What became of his bark and his followers
Wrecked the same instant of their masters death and
in the view of the shepherd so that all the
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found But O the noble
combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina She had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth
and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes caught the water though not
the fish was when at the relation of the queens
death with the manner how she came tot bravely
confessed and lamented by the king how
attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one
sign of dolour to another she did with an Alas
I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my
heart wept blood Who was most marble there changed
colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world
could have seen t the woe had been universal
Are they returned to the court
No the princess hearing of her mothers statue
which is in the keeping of Paulinaa piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work would
beguile Nature of her custom so perfectly he is her
ape he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer thither with all greediness of affection
are they gone and there they intend to sup
I thought she had some great matter there in hand
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever
since the death of Hermione visited that removed
house Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge
Lets along
Exeunt Gentlemen
Now had I not the dash of my former life in me
would preferment drop on my head I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what but he
at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter
so he then took her to be who began to be much
seasick and himself little better extremity of
weather continuing this mystery remained
undiscovered But tis all one to me for had I
been the finder out of this secret it would not
have relished among my other discredits
Enter Shepherd and Clown
Here come those I have done good to against my will
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
Come boy I am past moe children but thy sons and

I know you are now sir a gentleman born
Ay and have been so any time these four hours
And so have I boy
So you have but I was a gentleman born before my
father for the kings son took me by the hand and
called me brother and then the two kings called my
father brother and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father and
so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike
tears that ever we shed
We may live son to shed many more
Ay or else twere hard luck being in so
preposterous estate as we are
I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master
Prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are
gentlemen
Thou wilt amend thy life
Ay an it like your good worship
Give me thy hand I will swear to the prince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia
You may say it but not swear it
Not swear it now I am a gentleman Let boors and
franklins say it Ill swear it
How if it be false son
If it be neer so false a true gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friend and Ill swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk but Ill swear it and I would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands
I will prove so sir to my power
Ay by any means prove a tall fellow if I do not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not
being a tall fellow trust me not Hark the kings
and the princes our kindred are going to see the

good masters
Exeunt
Enter LEONTES POLIXENES FLORIZEL PERDITA CAMILLO PAULINA Lords and Attendants
O grave and good Paulina the great comfort
That I have had of thee
What sovereign sir
I did not well I meant well All my services
You have paid home but that you have vouchsafed
Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
It is a surplus of your grace which never
My life may last to answer
O Paulina
We honour you with trouble but we came
To see the statue of our queen your gallery
Have we passd through not without much content
In many singularities but we saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon
The statue of her mother
As she lived peerless
So her dead likeness I do well believe
Excels whatever yet you lookd upon
Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it
Lonely apart But here it is prepare
To see the life as lively mockd as ever
Still sleep mockd death behold and say tis well
PAULINA draws a curtain and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue
I like your silence it the more shows off
Your wonder but yet speak first you my liege
Comes it not something near
Her natural posture
Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione or rather thou art she
In thy not chiding for she was as tender
As infancy and grace But yet Paulina
Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
So aged as this seems
O not by much
So much the more our carvers excellence
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
As she lived now
As now she might have done
So much to my good comfort as it is
Now piercing to my soul O thus she stood
Even with such life of majesty warm life
As now it coldly stands when first I wood her
I am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me
For being more stone than it O royal piece
Theres magic in thy majesty which has
My evils conjured to remembrance and
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits
Standing like stone with thee
And give me leave
And do not say tis superstition that
I kneel and then implore her blessing Lady
Dear queen that ended when I but began
Give me that hand of yours to kiss
O patience
The statue is but newly fixd the colours Not dry
My lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away
So many summers dry scarce any joy
Did ever so long live no sorrow
But killd itself much sooner
Dear my brother
Let him that was the cause of this have power
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself
Indeed my lord
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrought youfor the stone is mine
Ild not have showd it
Do not draw the curtain
No longer shall you gaze ont lest your fancy
May think anon it moves
Let be let be
Would I were dead but that methinks already
What was he that did make it See my lord
Would you not deem it breathed and that those veins
Did verily bear blood
Masterly done
The very life seems warm upon her lip
The fixture of her eye has motion int
As we are mockd with art
Ill draw the curtain
My lords almost so far transported that
Hell think anon it lives
O sweet Paulina
Make me to think so twenty years together
No settled senses of the world can match
The pleasure of that madness Let t alone
I am sorry sir I have thus far stirrd you but
I could afflict you farther
Do Paulina
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort Still methinks
There is an air comes from her what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me
For I will kiss her
Good my lord forbear
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet
Youll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
With oily painting Shall I draw the curtain
No not these twenty years
So long could I
Stand by a looker on
Either forbear
Quit presently the chapel or resolve you
For more amazement If you can behold it
Ill make the statue move indeed descend
And take you by the hand but then youll think
Which I protest againstI am assisted
By wicked powers
What you can make her do
I am content to look on what to speak
I am content to hear for tis as easy
To make her speak as move
It is required
You do awake your faith Then all stand still
On those that think it is unlawful business
I am about let them depart
Proceed
No foot shall stir
Music awake her strike
Music
Tis time descend be stone no more approach
Strike all that look upon with marvel Come
Ill fill your grave up stir nay come away
Bequeath to death your numbness for from him
Dear life redeems you You perceive she stirs
HERMIONE comes down
You hear my spell is lawful do not shun her
Until you see her die again for then
You kill her double Nay present your hand
When she was young you wood her now in age
Is she become the suitor
O shes warm
If this be magic let it be an art
Lawful as eating
She embraces him
She hangs about his neck
If she pertain to life let her speak too
Ay and maket manifest where she has lived
Or how stolen from the dead
That she is living
Were it but told you should be hooted at
Like an old tale but it appears she lives
Though yet she speak not Mark a little while
Please you to interpose fair madam kneel
And pray your mothers blessing Turn good lady
Our Perdita is found
You gods look down
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughters head Tell me mine own
Where hast thou been preserved where lived how found
Thy fathers court for thou shalt hear that I
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in being have preserved
Myself to see the issue
Theres time enough for that
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation Go together
You precious winners all your exultation
Partake to every one I an old turtle
Will wing me to some witherd bough and there
My mate thats never to be found again
Lament till I am lost
O peace Paulina
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
As I by thine a wife this is a match
And made betweens by vows Thou hast found mine
But how is to be questiond for I saw her
As I thought dead and have in vain said many
A prayer upon her grave Ill not seek far
For him I partly know his mindto find thee
An honourable husband Come Camillo
And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
By us a pair of kings Lets from this place
What look upon my brother both your pardons
That eer I put between your holy looks
My ill suspicion This is your soninlaw
And son unto the king who heavens directing
Is trothplight to your daughter Good Paulina
Lead us from hence where we may leisurely
Each one demand an answer to his part
Performd in this wide gap of time since first
We were disseverd hastily lead away
Exeunt
